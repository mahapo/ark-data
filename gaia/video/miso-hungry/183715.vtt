00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:11.904 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Craig Anderson.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm a 38-year-old
actor and filmmaker,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.713 align:middle line:90%
and I live in Sydney, Australia.

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And though you probably
can't tell by looking at me,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little bit overweight.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
This is my castle, my
fortress of solitude.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of creative
arts studio and open plan

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
living space, better
known as a warehouse.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's here that I pursue my
dream of being a filmmaker.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I write, act in, and edit
a lot of my own material,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
the magic happens.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:90%
But being creative isn't easy.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.948 align:middle line:84%
It requires stimulation of
both the mind and the body.

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I start
each day with a trip

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.880 align:middle line:90%
to the local swimming pool.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
warehouse where I live.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.345 align:middle line:84%
And I'm now driving
to the local pool/gym.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:90%
It's got everything.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly
it has a shower.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And my warehouse only
has cold water shower so.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Every few days my daily
routine is to drive to the pool

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
and have a shower there.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
This might seem inconvenient,
but it beats a cold shower.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it gets me out of the
house, which, let's face it,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.887 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much my only
exercise for the day.

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
After avoiding weird glances
from people who've actually

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:90%
been in the pool, I head home.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Time for breakfast.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Working long hours takes
energy, and creative work

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
is no different.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So I like to start the day
with a big, hearty breakfast.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
A well-rounded
diet is important,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
so I try to include all
the important food groups--

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
bacon, eggs,
sausages, hash browns,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and a serving of Froot--

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Loops.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm clean, I'm fed, and
it's time to get to work.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is my room.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
When I finish at the
pool, I come back here

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's my bed, which
I haven't put away.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I sleep on the floor
on this mattress,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
but I put it in the
corner during the day

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
so that potential
clients who come in

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to check out the edits
that I've been doing

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
don't think that I'm a hobo.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That being said, I do have a
clothes rack in the corner.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:90%
No one ever says anything.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.155 align:middle line:90%
I keep my clothes.

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
This is where the fresh clothes
go and the used clothes.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I won't open that.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:90%
That's in there.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.395 align:middle line:84%
And this is my edit suite, where
I sit pretty much all the time.

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe once a week
I get to go out

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and actually shoot
something, which is fun.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time I
sit here at the control

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.655 align:middle line:84%
tower and edit exciting
film and TV projects.

00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Video editing is a
time intensive job.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's normal for me to sit in
my edit suite for hours on end,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.228 align:middle line:84%
getting up to only go to
the bathroom or to eat.

00:03:51.228 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And I often work
late into the night,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
which means my dinner
options can be very limited.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's 11:30 at night.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And I finished
some editing, which

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
is great, because I nailed it.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's 11:30 at night.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, all
the places that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
should be open where
you can buy food

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
are now closed, which means
I don't have many options.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:84%
There's convenience
stores, where

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I could get a sausage
roll and a flavored milk.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Or there's McDonald's.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.932 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to McDonald's.

00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Back from McDonald's.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And I got the beef value
meal, because value.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
You get a whole
bunch of burgers.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Which is good, because
I'll eat a few of them now.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones that don't get
through I can put in the fridge

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and I have for lunch or
for breakfast tomorrow.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
It's economic sense.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it--

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:90%
a snapshot of my life.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
You might find it strange,
but I'm doing what I love.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm chasing my dreams.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day, I
wouldn't trade it for anything.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.186 align:middle line:84%
The only problem
is, it's killing me.

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Another day, another burger.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.952 align:middle line:84%
In a typical week I'll eat at
least four fast food meals.

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
of it's convenience

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:90%
and how much is addiction.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure I want to know.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I do cook for myself,
it's usually just as bad.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I decided to keep a record
of my eating habits.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not pretty.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Pizza, burgers, fries, all kinds
of sweets, and gallons of soda.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's just in one week.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I know how bad this is for
me, but I can't seem to stop.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I've tried every
died under the sun.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But in the end the results
are always the same.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The diet becomes
impractical to maintain,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and I fall off the wagon.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I know I need to change,
but I really don't know how.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the change
I needed found me.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Like the country?

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Japan the country?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
No, I've never been before.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks ago I was
contacted by my friend

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Tim, a fellow filmmaker.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
He told me he wanted to make
a documentary about the health

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
benefits of the
Japanese lifestyle.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
As someone who grew
up in Japan, he

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
knows how different their
food culture is compared

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:90%
to the typical Western diet.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:90%
His idea was this--

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
send someone to
Japan for two weeks

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
to learn how the
Japanese live and eat.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Then have them return home
and recreate that lifestyle

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
for a further 10 weeks
and see what effect

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
this three-month Japanese
diet has on their health.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
For some reason
he thought of me.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Probably because
of my good looks.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
After talking to Tim,
I did a little research

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.937 align:middle line:90%
on Japanese health.

00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I found out that they
had some of the lowest

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
rates of obesity and heart
disease in the developed world.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
They also have a
very low cancer rate.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
The weird thing is, they don't
seem to skimp on their meals.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
They are eating all
the time, and it's

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:90%
a part of their culture.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So how is it a nation that
is so devoted to stuffing

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
their faces is amongst
the healthiest?

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
What is it about their
diet and lifestyle

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that lets them live such
long and healthy lives?

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%
I was intrigued.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:90%
So I told Tim I was in.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But before the fun
could start, there

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:84%
were a few things I
had to take care of.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:90%
I love blood tests.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Just very still.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.222 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:08:01.222 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm doing some medical
tests before I leave to get

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:90%
a snapshot of my overall health.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Once the diet is over I'll
come back and do the same tests

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and compare the results.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:84%
This should provide a very
clear picture of what effect

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:90%
that diet has had on my body.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:90%
How is my health in general?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Obviously it's not the best.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got your baseline here.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
areas of concern.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
The most obvious one is
this red number here 4GGT.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:90%
And that is a liver enzyme.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:84%
This particular enzyme lives
inside a healthy liver cell

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and does its toxic
waste recycling job.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
When that liver
cell is damaged, it

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
releases this into
the bloodstream,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
and then we measure it.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And yours has come back out
of reference range for that.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Out of reference?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Yours is high out
of range, and that

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:84%
would indicate an excessive
inflammation of your liver.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
That can be due to
a lot of reasons.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes just
carrying extra weight

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps having a very
high refined sugar diet

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
will actually promote that
extra demand on the liver,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.170 align:middle line:84%
damage those liver cells,
and then show this sort

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:90%
of result on the blood test.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This diet is about
more than just weight.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:90%
It's about improving my health.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm doing
this bio-impedance test.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Developed by NASA, the test
measures the biological age

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of the patient.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'll be pleasantly
surprised with the results.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The healthy body weight for
you should sit between that red

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:90%
line there, around 72 up to 75.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
this is you here.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I look like the timeline.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a little bit overweight.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that
needs to be looked at.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is when we
look at your biological age,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:84%
you've ticked in
at 64 years of age.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.383 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that all
of this is reversible.

00:10:06.383 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I get to keep this?

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You get to keep that.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I get to keep that.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> How very exciting for
me to have this document.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:84%
My exam results weren't
as pretty as this footage.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Here's how I shape up.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I weigh a whopping 138 kilos.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And although I'm
only 38 years old,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I have the liver of a
64-year-old heavy drinker.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
My high processed sugar
diet has caused my liver

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:90%
to have serious inflammation.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And the enzyme
levels on the liver

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:84%
function tests were completely
out of reference range.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm also at risk of future
cardiovascular disease,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
particularly heart
attacks and strokes.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing called
a C-reactive protein

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:84%
level, which is a good indicator
of cardiovascular risk.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Ideally you want
to score below 1.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Mine is at 4.6.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of unhealthy
numbers, my insulin level

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:90%
is at 36.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Ideally it should
be below 10, which

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
means I'm on the fast
track to type 2 diabetes.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
All this information
has just shown me

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
how much damage my current
lifestyle is doing to my body.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
As someone who doesn't have much
experience with Japanese food

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
or healthy food in general,
I need a little guidance

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:90%
before I leave.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm seeing a dietician to
get some advice on what to eat

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and what to avoid
eating whilst in Japan.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The Japanese have a wonderful
way of eating very close

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:90%
to nature.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And they eat primarily
a plant-based diet.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And it will be easy,
as far as I'm aware,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
for you to eat a much
healthier diet in Japan.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's have a look at the
foods you encounter in Japan.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:90%
We have fish here.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:84%
We have salad,
particularly seaweed salad.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't make that face.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> What face?

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Seaweed salad
is so good for you.

00:11:57.827 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
It's full of greens.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really good for you.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:84%
We have a little bit of rice,
some tofu, a Japanese omelet.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that I
love about this diet that's

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:84%
particular for Japan
are the fermented foods.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:84%
When you ferment
a food, not only

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
do make it easier for your
body to absorb it and therefore

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
get the nutrients
from it, but it also

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:84%
increases the bioavailability
of the bacteria.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So it increases our
vitamin K2, which

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
is really important for the
absorption of your vitamin D.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And so in your diet
plan here we're

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
going to include several
of them every day, natto

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:90%
being one of them.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Have you come across natto?

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> No, natto is one that
people have told me is a little

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:90%
displeasing, so to speak.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for it, but--

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Pungent, perhaps.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.225 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you could
get used to anything.

00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:53.663 align:middle line:84%
And I think in terms of
the increase of vitamin K2

00:12:53.663 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
bring into your body,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
get used to it.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.353 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:12:59.353 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing I'd
like to make an amendment

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
to your current diet is
the coffee that you drink.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Can you swap it for green tea?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can have four to
six cups of green tea day,

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:90%
no problem.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Green tea is amazing.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It just has so many different
nutrients, antioxidants,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
phytonutrients in
it that are going

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:90%
to be really useful for us.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the size of your
stomach fully expanded.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So one fist is your plant-based
foods, whatever they are.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And the second
first, half and half,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.670 align:middle line:84%
you can have rice on
one half, and a protein

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:90%
food on the other half.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So here I am about to
embark on one of the biggest

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:90%
adventures of my life.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
In less than 12 hours
I'll be in Japan.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
This could be the start of a
whole new chapter of my life--

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
a chance to turn things around
and start living healthy.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:84%
As long as I stay
focused and stay strong,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.626 align:middle line:90%
nothing will be able to stop me.

00:13:58.626 --> 00:13:59.608 align:middle line:90%
I hope.

00:13:59.608 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The city of Tokyo is
overwhelming-- neon lights

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
on every surface and
thousands of people

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:90%
bustling through the streets.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Even late at night the sidewalks
are crowded with pedestrians.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I've been told the average
Japanese day involves

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.805 align:middle line:90%
a lot of walking.

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And seeing as I've
already walked

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:84%
about a mile from the bus stop
to my motel, I can believe it.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
This constant daily
cardio is a key component

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to Japanese health, and
something I'll need to adopt.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
To help me, I'll be wearing
an activity tracker,

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
which will record my physical
activity the whole time I'm

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
This will give me an idea of
how much walking I'm doing

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and how much I'll need to do
to maintain the lifestyle back

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow my diet begins.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited, but
I'm also nervous.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm 38 years old going on 64.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.223 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't make this
lifestyle change now,

00:15:06.223 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many more
chances I'm going to get.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, I am in Japan.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I arrived last night, and
I've slept here in a motel,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very drowsy and excited.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But this morning
I'm going to have

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
my first meal of the diet, a
Japanese breakfast at the motel

I went to a convenience
store and asked,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
do you have chopsticks,
or to be honest,

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
do you have chopsticks for
people who aren't very good?

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.647 align:middle line:90%
And they said yes.

00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:46.605 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me these.

00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like

But they said it will make
it easy for me, because they

won't keep falling around.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would
normally have for breakfast--

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
pikelets and pastries,
sausages, bacon.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm at a
buffet I'd probably

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
have three or four
of these plates.

My dietician said eating
slowly will help me feel full

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and stop me from overeating.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So I've decided that for the
duration of this experiment,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to eat all my
meals with chopsticks.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And with my elite chopsticks
skills eating slowly

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:90%
should be a piece of cake.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
My dietician also
recommended that I drink

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%

to step things up.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
For the remainder
of my diet I'm going

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
to drink nothing but
green tea and water.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:84%
This means no more soda, no
more juice, and no more coffee.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Can I go in and look?

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> All green tea.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:90%
That's that one?

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get that.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I've only been in
Tokyo for one night.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But already I've noticed a
large number of elderly people

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.580 align:middle line:90%
out and about.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I read that Japanese
have the longest life

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
expectancy and more
people over 100

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
than any other
country in the world.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Is this because of their
diet and lifestyle?

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:90%
I sure hope so.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.182 align:middle line:84%
If the doctor was right
about my biological age,

00:23:33.182 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need some
of that longevity.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Me and the crew
have left the motel.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll be staying in a house we
rented for the next two weeks.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:90%
That is, if I can find it.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.254 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:56.254 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm in Asakusa.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And I left the
hotel, and I'm going

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:90%
to move into a house for a week.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's my job
to find the house.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, my
phone has died.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So good day for my step
tracker, because I'm

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
going to try and find
it by walking around.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The guy on the internet who
owns the house, my Airbnb, said,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
follow the golden
poo to start with.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%
So I'm pretty sure that's it.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we go across
the river, you know,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.117 align:middle line:84%
unless there's another golden
poo somewhere around here,

00:24:31.117 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty sure that's it.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I followed the golden Godzilla
turd across the bridge.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.465 align:middle line:84%
And after a lot more walking,
I eventually found the house.

00:24:41.465 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.373 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:24:49.373 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I think I just
turned on-- there's

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%
like nine light switches here.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what does this mean?

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.392 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:58.392 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been in
a Japanese house.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's wrong to
walk in with your shoes.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
on some of these.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to dress up like my
grandmother and keep looking.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that fits well.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.955 align:middle line:90%
Remind you of anything?

00:25:21.955 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
This is like how I
sleep at the office.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Except prettier.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
This is-- it's either a sauna
or a decompression chamber.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I reckon it's a sauna.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's rocks in there.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.325 align:middle line:90%
This is just like Japan.

00:25:38.325 --> 00:25:43.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm in.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:90%
There's rocks in here.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the end of day one,
and it's been a good day.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It's been all
Japanese food today.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm feeling good.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But also weird, a
little lightheaded.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone to the
bathroom like four times

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:90%
to push stuff out.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's
just the difference in food,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
like not being used
to it here, or if it's

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.280 align:middle line:90%
got to do with detoxing.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Green tea all day,
water all day.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I feel tired.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:90%
I've had a good day.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've done, like,
at least the amount

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:84%
of walking that I was
supposed to have done.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.983 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't skip a meal.

00:26:37.983 --> 00:26:38.900 align:middle line:90%
So now I'm off to bed.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.318 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm off to the
outskirts of Tokyo.

00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The crew has arranged for
me to be a dinner guest

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.880 align:middle line:90%
with a typical Japanese family.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.240 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to stick to
this diet when I get home,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll need to know what kind of
ingredients the Japanese use

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
and how they prepare them.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully Yuko and
her family will be

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:90%
able to give me some guidance.

wonders for the digestion

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:90%
It's like a scene from "Alien."

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:90%
This is my first try.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Never tried before.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Here we go. natto.

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:33.710 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Smell.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It smells a bit like glue.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.339 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.359 align:middle line:84%
A lot like paint
thinner or something.

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not too bad.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- it's a weird--

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:90%
that is the weirdest texture.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It's so stringy and
wet and glue-like.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And it does smell like I've
just finished painting a house.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:90%
But the taste is not too bad.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Not bad.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Not bad.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:84%
It may have smelled like
a ruptured septic tank

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and had the texture
of thick snot,

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.130 align:middle line:84%
but the natto didn't
actually taste too bad.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely
an acquired taste,

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:90%
like good Japanese vegemite.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's a great
source of protein.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It's loaded with
vitamin K and has

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
been known to reduce the risk
of cardiovascular disease.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.820 align:middle line:84%
It'll never be my
favorite dish, but I

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:84%
don't think I'll ever have
a problem eating it regular.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.141 align:middle line:90%
And speaking of regular.

00:35:48.141 --> 00:35:51.544 align:middle line:90%
[TOILET FLUSHES]

00:35:51.544 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in the bathroom a lot.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot as in three times a
day I go to the toilet now.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.005 align:middle line:90%
It's really weird.

00:36:05.005 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I have to keep going.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I've only been doing
this for a few days.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's because
it's the Japanese food that I'm

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:84%
not used to, or if
my body's detoxing

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.530 align:middle line:84%
from all the rubbish
and the sugar and stuff.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I have to
go the toilet a lot.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I go in
Tokyo I see food.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's a restaurant
on every street corner.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese really are
all about their food.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And while there are plenty of
fast food joints and greasy

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.710 align:middle line:84%
restaurants throughout
the city, finding

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:84%
traditional Japanese
meals doesn't

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:90%
seem to be a problem at all.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:90%


00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I've been eating at these types
of traditional restaurants

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.710 align:middle line:90%
since I landed.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But the house I'm staying
at also had a kitchen.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's time
to put my new cooking

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.000 align:middle line:90%
knowledge to the test.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But first, I'll
need some supplies.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I, um, too big.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's true.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Too big.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm on a diet.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to eat
Japanese food, so.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Seaweed.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> A kind of seaweed?

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:27.720 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> All seaweed.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that that--

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah this is it.

00:37:32.502 --> 00:37:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's that one.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.495 align:middle line:90%
Just a couple of pieces.

00:37:34.495 --> 00:37:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.962 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll try that.

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:36.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:37:36.886 --> 00:37:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] What the hell?

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so gluggy?

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Very sticky, yeah.

00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Very sticky, sorry.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.665 align:middle line:90%
>> This is all the seaweed.

00:37:56.665 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So sorry.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:05.996 --> 00:38:16.454 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.454 --> 00:38:18.625 align:middle line:84%
>> I just bought the
world's sharpest knife.

00:38:18.625 --> 00:38:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't advertised as
the world's sharpest knife.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But I was opening it,
I cut my thumb there.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried to tape it
up, but it keeps bleeding.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But I bought a knife, because
I need to cut some pickles.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's great.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's sesame
and peanut mixed

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.330 align:middle line:84%
in with some seaweed
and some greens.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:90%
This I got from the supermarket.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It is to be put on top of rice.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like something
you mix with rice.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.644 align:middle line:84%
I only have a very small
amount of rice today.

00:38:59.644 --> 00:39:01.352 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
stick it on top anyway.

00:39:01.352 --> 00:39:04.225 align:middle line:90%


00:39:04.225 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the miso
from the packet.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe it's because I
don't have a good palate,

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:90%
or I'm not used to it yet.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But it kind of tastes exactly
the same as any other miso.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:43.832 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.832 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there's a lot
more to the Japanese lifestyle

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:84%
than just eating
delicious meals.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:84%
To discover what it is that
keeps this nation so healthy,

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I need to experience
the different facets

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:90%
of their lives.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So today the crew
has arranged for me

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to spend an entire day with a
typical Japanese businessman.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd only just met Kazu before
it was time to get moving.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm told Japanese businessmen
do a lot of walking

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:90%
in an average workday.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Just fighting our way
into the crowded morning

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.020 align:middle line:90%
trains is exhausting.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing my best
not to slow him down,

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but when nature calls,
you have to answer.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry.

00:40:25.367 --> 00:40:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> As we get close to
his first appointment,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Kazu relaxes a little,
and we get to talk.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> You look very young.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm 38.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You're 38?

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> 38.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But do you think I'm older
or younger than I am?

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course older.

00:40:43.628 --> 00:40:46.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Kazu has three different
meetings today all across

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.230 align:middle line:90%
the city.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And he'll be
walking to each one.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying my best to keep
up, but my short strides

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.860 align:middle line:84%
are no match for
Kazu's power walk.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how he
does this every day.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:90%
My feet are killing me.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So I am going to
use my laptop bag--

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
which isn't a laptop
bag, because I

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.290 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to carry
around a laptop all day.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:90%
I did pack it with my shoes.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stick
these on instead.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
With his schedule
so tight I wasn't

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
sure we'd be able
to stop for lunch.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.160 align:middle line:90%
But working men need to eat.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.320 align:middle line:90%
And Kazu is no exception.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:84%
He's brought me to a
noodle bar for lunch,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.955 align:middle line:84%
though I'm not sure if
it counts as stopping.

00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:90%
There are no seats in here?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:90%

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.320 align:middle line:90%

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:90%
What are these called?

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Udon.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Udon.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Udon.

We're in and out of the noodle
bar in under eight minutes.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The udon noodles are tasty
and relatively healthy

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.520 align:middle line:84%
compared to the fast food
options I have back home.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if standing to
eat is good for digestion,

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.350 align:middle line:84%

to think about it.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.600 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's Friday.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you would
normally do on a Friday?

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:37.920 align:middle line:90%

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.240 align:middle line:90%

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Hang on.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:90%

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Kazu had booked us in at a
small bar called an izakaya.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where Japanese
businessmen often eat and drink

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.050 align:middle line:90%
after work.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:84%
If there's ever a place
to test my dedication

to this new healthy

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.290 align:middle line:84%
What type of food
do they make here?

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Noodles?

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.190 align:middle line:90%
A rice dish?

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I love edamame.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%

>> I have to eat Japanese
food to lose weight,

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So cabbage, healthy.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Tofu, healthy.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Oolong tea.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oolong tea.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> It's healthy, yeah.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of--

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I've heard of teppanyaki.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.560 align:middle line:90%

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised by the
range of food offered

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:90%
in this small restaurant.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.478 align:middle line:84%
The teppanyaki dish isn't the
healthiest, especially compared

00:44:16.478 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:90%
to what I've been eating.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's balanced
out with side orders

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of tofu, edamame beans, fresh
tomatoes, pickled cucumbers,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.280 align:middle line:90%
and sprouts.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
When I went to the
doctor, they did tests

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.360 align:middle line:84%
to find out what my
biological age is.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:84%
You know what biological
age-- yeah, OK.

I guess I asked for the

experience, so it's
time to climb on in.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.030 align:middle line:90%

I went for a walk.

just go for a walk
in the morning.

00:46:03.752 --> 00:46:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So I took my headphones
and walked around

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.337 align:middle line:84%
like I was a teenager in
high school or university.

00:46:09.337 --> 00:46:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I remember doing
that a lot, listening

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:90%
to music when I walked around.

So I did that, and
that was awesome.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.040 align:middle line:84%

Tofu is another cornerstone

I've been eating it

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And while it doesn't
taste bad, it's

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.480 align:middle line:90%
starting to get a little boring.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But apparently it comes in many
different forms and flavors.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So today I'm traveling to
a traditional style tofu

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:84%

their many dishes.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:84%

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:90%
A big, white square.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm told tofu is a great source
of protein, calcium, and iron.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And though it's a
bit bland on its own,

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.360 align:middle line:84%
when you serve it with these
tasty sauces and condiments,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:30.600 align:middle line:90%

Sorry.

It went-- it's like one
big, long strip of plastic,

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:90%
or like--

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's delicious, sure.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was like
eating cling wrap.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And it just was one big, long
thing that was joined together.

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:90%
So I digested it badly.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:90%
It all slid down.

Another one of these.

Yes, thank you.

After eating some more
of the hot tofu skin,

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.810 align:middle line:84%
it was time to sample
some of the other dishes--

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:42.610 align:middle line:84%
tofu salad, cold tofu skin,
and even a tofu dessert.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.430 align:middle line:84%
These tofu dishes sure
are tastier than the packs

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.020 align:middle line:90%
of plain tofu back home.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.870 align:middle line:84%
It's morning time, and I have
made myself some breakfast.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have natto,
soybean, and pickles.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've got soybean, because we
don't have a rice cooker here.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm eating soy and beans.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not good,
because they're both protein.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.574 align:middle line:90%
I've just realized.

00:50:25.574 --> 00:50:26.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but that's
what I'm eating.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've got some
green tea here as well.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten into the habit
of shopping for groceries

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.230 align:middle line:84%
instead of relying
on premade meals.

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.510 align:middle line:84%
This will be invaluable
when I have to keep

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.500 align:middle line:90%
the diet going back home.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I just went to get some
water and some natto

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.980 align:middle line:90%
at the convenience store.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.813 align:middle line:84%
I've put my jeans on
today, which is exciting.

00:50:56.813 --> 00:50:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Not because they're jeans, but
because I haven't worn them

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.823 align:middle line:84%
for a while, and they
are feeling loose.

00:51:01.823 --> 00:51:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Which is good, because when I
wore them a couple of months

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.440 align:middle line:84%
ago before I started this whole
process, they were very tight.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think I've lost some
weight around the waist, which

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.640 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:19.030 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole time I've
been here, I haven't

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:22.810 align:middle line:90%
seen any overweight people--

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.285 align:middle line:90%
certainly no one as big as me.

00:51:25.285 --> 00:51:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering, what
are the locals thinking

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.780 align:middle line:84%
when they see someone my size,
when all of a sudden it hit me.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.520 align:middle line:84%
There are people
this size in Japan.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're much bigger
in every possible way.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Sumo wrestlers are
cultural icons.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of them are
still born and raised in Japan.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So what are they eating in order
to reach their massive size?

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I asked the crew to arrange a
meeting with a sumo wrestler.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, they got
the biggest one of all time.

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:01.361 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Konishiki is a sumo legend.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Born in Hawaii, he's
a three-time champion

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and holds the record for the
heaviest sumo wrestler ever.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:15.190 align:middle line:84%
If anyone could tell me what
to avoid in my diet, it's him.

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm just hoping
he won't be angry

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:22.680 align:middle line:84%
when I ask him what I should be
doing to not end up like him.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice a
difference in food

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:26.810 align:middle line:90%
between here and Samoa, Hawaii?

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the food here
is great, you know,

00:52:29.278 --> 00:52:31.820 align:middle line:84%
even though at the beginning my
career there were some things

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.470 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't eat, like natto.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Natto is that--

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I know natto.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.800 align:middle line:90%
I eat it every morning now.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I love it now, but I couldn't
eat it before, natto.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:44.270 align:middle line:84%
The tofu wasn't
something I ate before.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think Japan has
a very healthy diet naturally.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I've noticed.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier for
me to eat healthy here.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.055 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot easier.

00:52:53.055 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And you notice, everything
that comes with Japan food,

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:56.570 align:middle line:90%
there's always vegetables.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Always vegetables.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you eat to
get big as a sumo--

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Chankonabe is a mixture
of a lot of vegetables.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And then your base
soup can be salt,

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.180 align:middle line:90%
your base soup could be miso.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.280 align:middle line:90%
It can be like kimchi.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you add meat to
it, maybe pork, or beef,

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.310 align:middle line:90%
or seafood.

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It don't matter.

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Chicken.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's like a stew.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds--

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's healthy.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.247 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds healthy, right?

00:53:25.247 --> 00:53:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not the food
that really gets us big.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out sumo wrestlers
eat similar types of food

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to regular Japanese people.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The major difference seems to
be the quantity that they eat.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
normal, what we call,

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.420 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING JAPANESE] in Japan.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the normal size of
a Japanese person at home.

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:49.980 align:middle line:84%
This is like the average bowl
that we use in sumo stables.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> For rice and stew.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And the young fellas would be
eating three or four of those--

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody.

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone.

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> everybody.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But the young ones
would just eat more.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the difference, yeah?

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's like how we see all
these Japanese people walking

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:05.870 align:middle line:90%
around skinny.

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.220 align:middle line:90%
But that's not only the reason.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.397 align:middle line:84%
If you see the distance that
they walk from door to door

00:54:10.397 --> 00:54:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to work every day,
you're going to find out,

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.897 align:middle line:84%
because they, all of
them, catch trains.

00:54:13.897 --> 00:54:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> My meeting with Konishiki
gave me a lot to think about.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
While Japanese food is
healthy for the most part,

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.650 align:middle line:84%
overeating can still
cause problems.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And Konishiki reinforced just
how much the Japanese walk.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:31.670 align:middle line:84%
They walk to work, to

that I've just grounded up.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.180 align:middle line:90%
So this is tamagoyaki.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.775 align:middle line:90%
It's like an omelet.

01:00:57.775 --> 01:01:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Man, this is upper level.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.885 align:middle line:90%
This?

01:01:03.885 --> 01:01:05.140 align:middle line:90%
In it goes.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, OK.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.450 align:middle line:90%
All right, good.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:09.396 align:middle line:90%
Under.

01:01:09.396 --> 01:01:10.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Under.

01:01:10.196 --> 01:01:12.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Under.

01:01:12.234 --> 01:01:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Under.

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So you just lift it up
and let it fall under.

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:19.012 align:middle line:90%
Ho, this is the worst part.

01:01:19.012 --> 01:01:23.220 align:middle line:90%

01:01:24.663 --> 01:01:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I can.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Quickly.

>> [EXCLAIMS]

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:31.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

01:01:31.035 --> 01:01:31.835 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:38.280 align:middle line:90%


01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
With all of the individual
ingredients prepared,

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
it's time to build
the bento boxes.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Like most Japanese
meals, the bento box

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:50.136 align:middle line:84%
consists of a lot of small
side dishes and vegetables.

01:01:50.136 --> 01:01:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look at that.

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:52.480 align:middle line:90%
That is beautiful.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
We have our omelet
called tamagoyaki.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
We've got all of our
vegetables there.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And we have a plum.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We have our rice
with nori on top.

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath we have
kombu, another type of seaweed,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.850 align:middle line:90%
green goodness.

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Now that I know how
to make the bento box,

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:17.151 align:middle line:84%
I need to buy one of my
own to take home with me.

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%


01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.040 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cute.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
have a boy's one.

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.820 align:middle line:90%
But I don't mind.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:27.620 align:middle line:90%
I like this.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%


01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Today I sort of
solved a big problem.

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I now know I can take bento on
to my work, my weird, random,

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.760 align:middle line:84%
"who knows what day where
I'm going to be" type work.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.028 align:middle line:84%
And I can open it up and just
have it at my regular times.

01:02:52.028 --> 01:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to solve
a lot of problems for me

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
when I get back and I
am stressed about what

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do every day.

01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I pack.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I can be self-sufficient, pretty
much, for one, even two meals

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day,
and then just make sure

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I get home to prepare my
other meal, or if I'm out,

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
at a place that sells sushi or
the type of food I need to get.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:17.860 align:middle line:90%


01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Japan now
for almost two weeks.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I've got
the food thing figured out.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
I feel confident in knowing
what to eat and what to avoid.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Shopping and cooking for myself
has become a habit, and foods

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that I would never
have eaten back home--

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
tofu, pickled vegetables,
green tea, even natto--

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.680 align:middle line:90%
now feel normal to me.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
I'm keeping

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.265 align:middle line:90%
an eye on my portion sizes.

01:03:42.265 --> 01:03:44.890 align:middle line:90%


01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.730 align:middle line:90%
So I just lost my pants.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.720 align:middle line:90%
When I'm carrying bags--

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.593 align:middle line:90%
there's good news.

01:03:56.593 --> 01:03:57.760 align:middle line:90%
We're heading to the temple.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.200 align:middle line:90%
But my pants have become looser.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It means they fall down when
I'm not able to hitch them up

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
as I'm walking.

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:09.387 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Where do I put this?

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.020 align:middle line:90%
How do I--

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.370 align:middle line:90%


01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It's my final weekend in
Japan, and the crew and I

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.710 align:middle line:84%
are spending it at a
Zen Buddhist temple

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
a few hours out of Tokyo.

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've learned
a lot about Japan's food

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and lifestyle.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
If I can stay motivated
once I get home,

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I know this diet
will be a success.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping a Buddhist monk
can give me some guidance

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.565 align:middle line:90%
and help me stay focused.

01:04:35.565 --> 01:04:38.300 align:middle line:90%


01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Konishiki, when he visited
the temple last week,

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
there's some sort
of ritual where

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.640 align:middle line:90%
they hit you with a stick.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And because he's
Konishiki and a big guy,

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
they went and got a really
big stick, a thick one,

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.260 align:middle line:90%
and they hit him really hard.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
And it welted and became black.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It was a very painful
mark that they left.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.897 align:middle line:84%
And he says they were
doing it for comedy.

01:05:03.897 --> 01:05:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little bit
worried, because I

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
think probably the temple's
been briefed that I'm a comedian

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and there's going
to be a film crew.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm worried
that the monk, he's

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
going to hit me harder,
because it's funny to do that.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
We've stopped at a
roadside diner for lunch.

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pleasantly
surprised to find that even

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
here healthy meal options
are readily available.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
This is from a roadside
diner in Japan.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The crew have been able to order
slightly more exciting meals,

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
with deep-fried stuff and
burgers and western things.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is what I can get
at a diner in the roadside

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:50.750 align:middle line:90%
along a highway in Japan.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
If I was in Australia
and I was pulling over,

01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd be eating burgers and
sandwiches and hot chips.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But this is what I got
here, a very healthy meal.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%


01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
With lunch out of the way we
continue to the temple high

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.820 align:middle line:90%
in the mountains west of Tokyo.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.570 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We arrive just
after lunch to find

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Asami, the temple's sole monk
and caretaker, waiting for us.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, nice to meet you.

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Craig.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:32.260 align:middle line:90%


01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you live here?

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Alone?

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, are you OK?

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not scared.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:40.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.565 align:middle line:90%
It's really pretty, yeah.

01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:49.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> 250?

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:53.210 align:middle line:90%
This building is 250 years old.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It's in good shape.

01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It's still strong.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:06:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Congratulations.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:03.620 align:middle line:90%
You're not 250 years old?

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, just checking.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:12.952 align:middle line:84%
I have come to Japan,
because I'm too big.

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:16.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
ask you, what I can

01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:24.520 align:middle line:90%
learn from Zen to be healthy?

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
What I need to do, prepare
my mind, for when I go back?

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:44.660 align:middle line:90%


01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be very simple.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to think of nothing
else other than this exercise.

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It's copying the sutra.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.480 align:middle line:90%
This?

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> No smell.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, no smell.

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:09.420 align:middle line:90%


01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.972 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not supposed
to be talking to you,

01:08:11.972 --> 01:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
because I'm working
on my [? ku. ?]

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we have--

01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Carrot.

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --carrot, bean, shiitake.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And shiitake.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And miso?

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Miso soup.

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Miso soup.

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And rice.

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And rice.

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, please.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It looks fantastic.

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try some.

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I might just start
with the one I made--

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:37.340 align:middle line:90%
tempura pumpkin.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
This is all extremely healthy,
and it's all vegetarian.

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The monk is mostly
vegetarian when in town.

01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But when he's outside
of the building,

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.740 align:middle line:90%
he'll drop into Mos Burger.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm having such a great
time with this pumpkin.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.717 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:54.717 --> 01:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what I made.

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:59.810 align:middle line:90%


01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, nice.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:15.240 align:middle line:90%


01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Today Asami will teach me
more meditation techniques.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But first, he has a
little gift for me.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
As you may have noticed,
I'm now wearing suspenders.

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in a 1993 music video.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I am wearing suspenders
because the monk,

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.615 align:middle line:84%
after my pants fell down
embarrassingly in the kitchen

01:15:33.615 --> 01:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
when I was trying to
help him in the kitchen,

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:36.915 align:middle line:90%
he said he had suspenders.

01:15:36.915 --> 01:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And he went and found them, and
he gave them to me this morning

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.440 align:middle line:90%
as a gift.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.148 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to check if
he wants them back.

01:15:42.148 --> 01:15:44.667 align:middle line:84%
But if he doesn't, I'll
be wearing some suspenders

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
with these jeans now,
because the jeans have

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.660 align:middle line:84%
become quite loose in the
time I've been in Japan.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's both exciting
and a real bonus.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.591 align:middle line:90%


01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:59.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.050 align:middle line:90%
That's all right.

01:16:01.050 --> 01:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:03.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Asami tells me
today's lesson will

01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:08.910 align:middle line:84%
be more enlightening than
tracing the [? ku. ?]

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
I'm a bit nervous.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:23.250 align:middle line:90%


01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm told this technique
will help me stay focused

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and keep my mind clear.

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But I seem to be getting
whacked more than the others.

01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:32.490 align:middle line:90%


01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this is Asami's
way of telling me to keep quiet

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.285 align:middle line:90%
about his Mos Burger habits.

01:16:36.285 --> 01:16:51.470 align:middle line:90%


01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
With my Zen training complete,
it's time to fly home.

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
My journey here has
taught me a lot of things.

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's taught me that eating
healthy can also be delicious,

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and that daily exercise
and portion control

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
can mean the difference
between slim and sumo.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Now it's up to me to
take this knowledge home

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and apply it to my life.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:23.756 align:middle line:90%


01:17:23.756 --> 01:17:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Go for a walk?

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good boy.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Good boy.

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.697 align:middle line:90%


01:17:33.697 --> 01:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been home for
a little while now,

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and I've been wondering
how to integrate what I

01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:40.590 align:middle line:90%
learned into my daily routine.

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Each day in Japan I was walking
almost twice the distance

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I was before I
started this diet.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And with a little
help from Malcolm here

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to
keep that number up.

01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It's been great, and not
just for me, but for Malcolm

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.700 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.373 align:middle line:84%
Because, between you
and me, he was starting

01:17:56.373 --> 01:17:57.540 align:middle line:90%
to gain a little bit chubby.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.490 align:middle line:90%
I've kept up my shopping habits.

01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And though the
big grocery chains

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of the
more obscure food items,

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I found an Asian grocer
nearby that stocks almost

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.460 align:middle line:90%
everything I need.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I visit them so often now
that the owner told me

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I was his biggest customer.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.640 align:middle line:90%
At first I was flattered.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.187 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
he was making a joke.

01:18:20.187 --> 01:18:23.530 align:middle line:90%


01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I have a good source for
almost all the ingredients

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I need to maintain my diet--

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
miso paste, tofu,
natto, fish flakes,

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:35.882 align:middle line:84%
dried pickles, ume
plums, and konjaku.

01:18:35.882 --> 01:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of the fresh
veggies I wanted,

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
like daikon, gobo,
and bamboo shoots,

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:41.600 align:middle line:90%
are a lot harder to track down.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So I have to make do
with what I can find.

01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:47.960 align:middle line:90%


01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I still need to spend long
hours in the edit room.

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But I've replaced the
Coke with green tea.

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
snacking, I keep plenty

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:57.080 align:middle line:90%
of edamame beans on hand.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
They're delicious, high
in protein and vitamins,

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and low in fat.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Plus, it's a fun word to say.

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Edamame.

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%


01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
This evening I'm
helping a friend perform

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:12.230 align:middle line:90%
at the Sydney Comedy Festival.

01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:13.910 align:middle line:90%
In the old days I'd have driven.

01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like
a nice evening,

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.620 align:middle line:90%
so I've decided to walk instead.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I always run into old
friends at events like these.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they want
to grab a bite to eat.

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm worried that
at this late hour

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
the only food options
will be greasy junk food.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out
my local sushi bar

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
has a back menu full of
traditional and healthy dishes.

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So I've been to the
local sushi train.

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is a whole
train of salmon, natto.

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can also get
the pickled plum, ume,

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.150 align:middle line:84%
which is what I stick in
my rice every morning.

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:54.950 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to
work hard to find it.

01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:56.670 align:middle line:90%
You need just to ask.

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Sushi train?

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
They put out stuff in the train.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But they put the big ones
out, the ones everyone wants.

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
want it to go to waste.

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But the menu, that's
where you can get plum,

01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:09.420 align:middle line:90%
natto, and pickles.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It's great for nights
when I want to go out

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:13.200 align:middle line:90%
or don't have time to cook.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the look on the
waitress' face the first time

01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I ordered natto was priceless.

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
adapting the Japanese diet

01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to fit my lifestyle has been
a fairly simple and painless

01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:26.250 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Keeping it up for the remainder
of my 12-week experiment

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.170 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be a problem at all.

01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Unless something drastically
changes in my work life.

01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I've just checked
my emails, and I've

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
got a job coming up where
I'm directing a comedy

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.400 align:middle line:90%
show starting in like two days.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.585 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to
be a lot of work,

01:20:46.585 --> 01:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
be on set a lot.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've been planning
how to do my morning

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
ritual to make sure I get
my bento box done in time.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:04.146 align:middle line:90%


01:21:04.146 --> 01:21:04.946 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

01:21:04.946 --> 01:21:10.380 align:middle line:90%


01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm making my bento
while I eat breakfast,

01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
just because I have to save
some time in the morning.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is the plum that
I've put on in the rice.

01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:26.070 align:middle line:90%


01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:29.130 align:middle line:90%
So that is my rice component.

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Done.

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:33.390 align:middle line:84%
No I'll make the good
side of the bento box.

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not a big rice
eater, I love this part.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
This has got all the protein
and the vegetables in it.

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.060 align:middle line:90%


01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Konjaku.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:44.703 align:middle line:90%


01:21:44.703 --> 01:21:45.503 align:middle line:90%
Carrot.

01:21:45.503 --> 01:21:49.340 align:middle line:90%


01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm building my bento
box for the day.

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also making a little
brown rice, tofu, and avocado

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.690 align:middle line:90%
sushi roll as a snack.

01:21:57.690 --> 01:22:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can't forget about
the miso soup and thermos

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:00.950 align:middle line:90%
of green tea.

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:08.200 align:middle line:90%


01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Aside from all
the extra walking,

01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I also like to start my days
now with some light exercise

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
followed by my usual trip
to the local swimming pool.

01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
But not just to shower.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Now I like to swim
a few laps first.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Swimming at a swimming pool--

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
who'd have guessed?

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:29.610 align:middle line:90%


01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:33.317 align:middle line:84%
So today we're filming in a
house in a suburb in Sydney.

01:22:33.317 --> 01:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
There's always a lot of
temptation in the morning,

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
because the first
things that happened

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
is they lay out
all the hot food,

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:43.822 align:middle line:84%
and everyone just sits and eat
while I wait for them to start.

01:22:43.822 --> 01:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But I still have to get
here at the right time,

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.490 align:middle line:84%
because I'm the guy
who picks the space.

01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we move, and they start
slowly building and eating.

01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So I have to sit and wait
for them to finish eating.

01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:00.100 align:middle line:90%


01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.490 align:middle line:90%
But lucky I have natto.

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:09.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's keeping me sustained.

01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I would love you
guys to still be

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.230 align:middle line:90%
orientated towards the screens.

01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:16.280 align:middle line:90%
So pathetic, yeah.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And like, oh, look at what
this person is up to, yeah.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And then maybe--

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Directing is one of
my biggest passions,

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
especially directing comedy.

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But lunch on set
requires discipline.

01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
The catered meals smell good--

01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:32.250 align:middle line:90%
really good.

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's lunchtime on set.

01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's got their
lunch that's been catered for.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But I've got my
rice and bento box.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's very supportive.

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:48.660 align:middle line:90%
They're teasing me today.

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But normally they'd
be very supportive.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:57.187 align:middle line:90%


01:23:57.187 --> 01:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We're just going to go
all get [INAUDIBLE] mash

01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.520 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, enjoy it.

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:07.414 align:middle line:84%
People make fun of me and
get to eat mashed potato.

01:24:07.414 --> 01:24:09.803 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

01:24:09.803 --> 01:24:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to try some?

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.740 align:middle line:90%
You can try some.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Come on, man.

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.690 align:middle line:90%
You want some?

01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:15.747 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try it?

01:24:15.747 --> 01:24:23.870 align:middle line:90%


01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I cook easy Japanese meals
every evening after work.

01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And tamagoyaki is a
simple dish to make.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a square pan,
but my round frying pan

01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:35.010 align:middle line:90%
will get the job done.

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:36.935 align:middle line:90%
It's not pretty, but it works.

01:24:36.935 --> 01:24:39.460 align:middle line:90%


01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.385 align:middle line:84%
It's so nerve
racking, the bit where

01:24:41.385 --> 01:24:43.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to pick it
up and get the thing

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.285 align:middle line:90%
to slide under in time.

01:24:45.285 --> 01:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't,
it just starts cooking,

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.050 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't slide anymore.

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But I made it, so
crisis averted.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:55.930 align:middle line:90%


01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, cut.

01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's do it.

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's shoot that.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Can I get you
starting further back?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Everyone starting further back?

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Directing the comedy program
over the past few weeks

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.730 align:middle line:90%
has been hectic.

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But through it all I've managed
to stay true to my diet--

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:13.030 align:middle line:84%
natto for breakfast,
followed by exercise,

01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:16.960 align:middle line:84%
then my morning stroll,
swim, and shower.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I prepare my bento box
daily to eat on set.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And cooking meals has become
a part of my daily life.

01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
This Japanese way of eating
no longer feels like a diet.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I eat every meal
with chopsticks,

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and drinking nothing but green
tea has become second nature.

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.880 align:middle line:90%


01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
The 12 weeks is up.

01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And though I feel great, it's
time to return to the doctor

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and see exactly what effect this
lifestyle has had on my health.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing that we'll
talk about is your amazing

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.890 align:middle line:90%
weight loss.

01:25:54.890 --> 01:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You're down from 138 kilograms
on our first visit to 114

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.310 align:middle line:90%
kilograms today.

01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's a 24-kilogram loss,
which is incredibly great.

01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, your weight loss
has brought your biological age

01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:12.630 align:middle line:90%
down from 64 years down to 55.

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're a work
in progress there.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, that result is
very dependent on the weight.

01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So the more weight you
lose, the more favorable

01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:23.430 align:middle line:90%
that result will be over time.

01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The other really good result
from a medical perspective

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is that your abnormal liver
function tests are now normal.

01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
The C-reactive protein is
the inflammation marker

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that we looked at.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And you scored 4.6 previously.

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:39.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's down to 2 now.

01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the
lower that score,

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
the less cardiovascular risk
you have moving forward.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So you no longer have
that medically significant

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
inflammation of
your liver that was

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
quite obvious on your
previous liver function tests

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.560 align:middle line:84%
that we checked
a few months ago.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Your insulin levels--

01:26:57.810 --> 01:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
those prediabetic,

01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
worrying insulin
levels previously--

01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:04.470 align:middle line:90%
they've dropped by 64%.

01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They're nearly in
normal range now.

01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:08.010 align:middle line:90%
You were at 36.

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:09.180 align:middle line:90%
You're now at 13.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And the ideal is 10 or below.

01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:13.710 align:middle line:90%
So you're ever so close to that.

01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at across the
board, a reduced risk of type 2

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, a reduced
risk of heart attack

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and a stroke, much
improved liver function

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
test, and your knees
will thank you.

01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The doctor's consultation
produced some amazing results.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
My weight is down from 138 to
114, a drop of 24 kilograms

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
or around 50 pounds
in just two weeks.

01:27:40.170 --> 01:27:44.670 align:middle line:84%
My biological age is
down from 64 to 55.

01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
My liver function test also
shows the inflammation is gone.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And my liver enzyme
levels are back

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
within the reference range.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Also, my C-reactive protein
level, the heart attack

01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:58.860 align:middle line:84%
indicator, is now a
much healthier 2.0.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm aiming at a
perfect score of 0 soon.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And finally, my insulin
levels are also down.

01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Before the diet I was on a scary
36, well above the healthy 10

01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and under range.

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
It's now down to 13.

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And with a little more
work I'm confident I

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.760 align:middle line:90%
can get it to under 10.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.690 align:middle line:90%


01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Living the Japanese diet
these past few months

01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:27.910 align:middle line:84%
has had a profound
impact on my life.

01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just talking about
the weight loss and improved

01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:32.440 align:middle line:90%
health.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It's shown me that
it's never too late

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.300 align:middle line:84%
to make a positive
change in life,

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and that I've got the
willpower to make it happen.

01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that dieting
isn't just about food choices.

01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's also about mindset.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm determined to continue my
journey towards better health.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.940 align:middle line:84%
My new lifestyle has filled
me with happiness and energy.

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I'm
also filled with pride.

01:28:56.170 --> 01:28:59.470 align:middle line:90%
