00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I've come to see Dr.
Margie Smith, who

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is a molecular geneticist
studying the microbiome.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome is
essentially the makeup

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
of different microbes
from bacteria

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to parasites and yeast, which
live on and inside of you.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And to test a microbiome,
you need a poo sample.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Poop can tell you quite
a lot about your gut health.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And we rely on a fingerprinting
technique, if you like.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So each bacteria has
its own fingerprint.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So we can drill down
to species level

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to define what is actually
in the microbiome.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The attention that we're
seeing in this area is huge.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we've finally
realized that the microbiome

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and the metabolites and
the bacteria produced

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
have a major impact
on our health.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We have microbes living
inside our digestive system.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very complex
microbial community.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:90%
There are bacteria.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
There are viruses, fungi,
protozoa, worms, slugs,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of creatures.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
creatures live together

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:90%
in harmony in a healthy person.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:90%
They plant each other.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:90%
They harvest each other.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:90%
They eat each other.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
They control each
other, and they do not

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
allow any one of them to
overgrow and to dominate

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:90%
the scene.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, we human beings are
very good at creating imbalance

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
When we take antibiotics, when
we eat chemical-laden food that

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:84%
is grown for us by our chemical
agriculture, when we take

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
any other chemicals
into the body,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
a part of that
microbial community

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
gets damaged, which means
the balance is upset.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So when that community
is not balanced

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and certain microbes
are in excess

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and other microbes
are not there,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
we don't digest food well.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't absorb it well, and
we develop multiple nutritional

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:90%
deficiencies.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, this
pathogenic microbes

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
digest food that we swallow
in their own sweet way,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
converting it into a whole
host of very toxic substances.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And they damage the
integrity of our gut wall,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:90%
making it porous and leaky.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Holes develop literally
in the gut wall.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So these toxic chemicals that
these microbes have created

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:90%
absorb.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
They absorb into the
bloodstream and get

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:90%
distributed all over the body.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And wherever they get
to, they cause trouble.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:90%
They will cause disease.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
If they get in the
brain, they could

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:84%
cause any group of symptoms
the brain can produce.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these
group of symptoms

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
can fit into an established
diagnostic label,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
such as bipolar disorder
or depression or anorexia

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:90%
or schizophrenia or autism.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, every chronic
disease, whether it's

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
mental or physical disease,
begins in the digestive system.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The microbial cells in our
body are estimated to vastly

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:90%
outnumber our own human cells.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Most of these little guys live
inside your digestive system.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can have up to
2 kilograms worth in there.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The person sitting
next to you right now

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
might share around 99% of the
same human DNA as yourself,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
but only 10% of the
same microbial DNA.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:10%
So experts are now
saying that it's

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:10%
these microbes and
the differences

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:10%
in our microbiome genetics which
account for a large part of who

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:10%
we are as unique human beings.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The microbiomes
are very complex.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
We can think of it actually
as a complex organ now.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has very wide ranging
impact on human health.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:10%
We now understand that the
gut microbiome interacts

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:10%
with the immune system,
metabolic responses, and brain

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:10%
function in the host.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So at this time, we
think that establishing

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.718 align:middle line:84%
a healthy microbiome
is essential.

00:08:57.718 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Every few years, there's
greater understanding

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
of different systems
within the body.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And over the last decade
or so there's greater,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, acknowledgment
of the role of bacteria,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
both in our gastrointestinal
system, but also on our skin.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
The gut's responsible
for our mood.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible for
our interpretation

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
of our environment.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It alters the way in
which we feel about life.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So we have bugs everywhere.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.302 align:middle line:84%
We have in our
sinuses, our ears.

00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:24.135 align:middle line:90%
We have on our skin.

00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
We have them in our
digestive tract.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look, there are
bugs that live symbiotically

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Bacteria don't just sit
there and chomp away on whatever

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
remnants have managed to
make it past your stomach.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
They're there to
produce metabolites.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:10%
Those metabolites might
fire up your immune system,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:10%
your innate immune
system, or they

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:10%
might work really well with
it and keep inflammation

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:10%
at bay in your body.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:10%
>> It has multiple functions,
but one of the most important

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:10%
one is what's called
colonization resistance,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:10%
where it prevents us from
colonizing with new bugs that

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:10%
might like to infect us.

No phone, no laptop, no
luxuries, no nothing.

00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
week, I'm going

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to test my microbiome to
see how it changes whilst

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:90%
living the San lifestyle.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, I don't
really know what to expect.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
I noticed about the San

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is that the majority of them
are quite lean and exhibit great

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.960 align:middle line:84%
vitality, even in the
older members of the tribe.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They move easily and have
a natural bubbliness,

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:90%
which is really infectious.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, for
the San as a whole,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
this village represents
a tiny subset

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
of the entire population
who predominantly do not

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
experience good health.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
The further removed from
society and Western influence,

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
the healthier the San get,
which is why what we're doing

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:90%
is so precious.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.250 align:middle line:84%
They have very little
access to modern medicine

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and antibiotics here.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And from a microbiome
standpoint,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:90%
that's very important.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.280 align:middle line:84%
First up on the plan is to go
harvesting for some local bush

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.202 align:middle line:90%
food.

from everybody.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that really
important, the community?

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's really important.

Of course, you
are the young one,

>> The plant is only outside.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So the root is
inside in the ground.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So they go in to
dig that root out.

One of the most
stark differences

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:84%
in diet between traditional
cultures like the San

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and us in the West is the
amount of fiber we consume.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Overwhelmingly,
those in the West

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
are reported to
consume much less fiber

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
than is optimal to maintain
gastrointestinal health.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the hallmarks of a
traditional hunter-gatherer

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
diet is a truckload of fiber
each and every single day.

>> The way fiber helps
your gut is not solely,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
but principally through the
boost effect to good bacteria

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
in your gut.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that if you change
your diet from one type

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
of eating or style of eating
to another, within 24 hours,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
you will have shifted the major
players in your microbiome.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> One particular type of
fiber, which is receiving a lot

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of attention is
resistant starch.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Resistant starch is
a carbohydrate source,

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
a fuel source for our
microbiome in our gut.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:90%
We need to have it.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So rice, bananas,
tubers, yams, all

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
of those sorts of things that
contain resistant starch are

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:90%
essential for our microbiome.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have them, our
bacteria cannot thrive.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And if our bacteria can't
thrive, we can't thrive.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Most starch is
easily digested.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.470 align:middle line:84%
However, resistant
starch is not.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it becomes food
for your gut bacteria.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:10%
Starch is dissolved
in the small intestine

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:10%
and then absorbed by
your body, providing you

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:10%
with energy and nutrition.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But the remaining
non-digestible portion

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:90%
is called resistant starch.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:10%
And this resistant starch
continues its journey

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:10%
through your gut and arrives
at the large intestine.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Here, we see the
resistant starch

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
exposed to the
probiotic bacteria

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:90%
of the large intestine.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of these probiotic bugs
specialize in breaking down

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
the resistant starch.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.760 align:middle line:84%
This breakdown process
provides the bacteria

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
with the fuel they
need to survive.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
As they use the
starch for energy,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
they release small carbohydrate
molecules which the neighboring

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
bacteria feed on.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.365 align:middle line:84%
As these bacteria feed, they
excrete even smaller molecules

00:23:38.365 --> 00:23:39.165 align:middle line:90%
as waste.

00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
One of the final waste
products is called butyrate,

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
a highly anti-inflammatory
fatty acid,

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:84%
which is also an energy
source for your body.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
As this butyrate builds
up, it is absorbed

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:90%
by the large intestine.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And its presence
encourages blood

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to flow into the
surrounding vessels,

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:90%
keeping the tissue healthy.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:84%
If your diet includes
enough resistant starch,

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
these cells will use butyrate
as their main source of energy.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Here, we can see the
molecular surface of one

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:90%
of the intestinal cells.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:84%
The surface is covered
in special proteins

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
that actively pump butyrate
molecules into the cell.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Once inside, they can
be harvested for energy.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Among an array of
health benefits,

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
butyrate could stop us getting
certain types of cancer.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Intestinal cells are
sensitive to DNA damage

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
caused by environmental,
diet, and lifestyle factors.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
This cell's DNA
has been damaged,

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:90%
resulting in a mutation.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
More damage could
accumulate over time

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
as the cell divides, which
could lead to colorectal cancer.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But a steady supply of
butyrate allows the damage

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.080 align:middle line:84%
to be more easily
detected, and the cell

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:84%
can activate a suicide
program in response.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the damaged
cell destroys itself,

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.372 align:middle line:84%
it can't progress
to form a cancer.

over 80% of children who
received our probiotic peanut

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:10%

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:84%
The babies that are
born today, this year,

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.720 align:middle line:84%
have worse gut flora
than babies who

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:84%
were born even a couple of
years ago or five years ago.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Because every generation gets
worse and worse gut flora.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is the real
epidemic of GAPS,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
of abnormal gut flora and all
the illnesses connected to it.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:10%
The environment we human beings
have created on our planet

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:10%
is unfit for our
children to come into.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:90%
This is not genetics.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Genetics have nothing
to do with this.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
This is purely lifestyle and
diet and the environment.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:90%
We talked about what GAPS is.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
These children were born with
a perfectly normal brain.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:84%
These were perfectly normal
babies at the moment of birth.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
But they acquire
abnormal gut flora

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.449 align:middle line:90%
from their parents from day one.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:15.210 align:middle line:84%
C-section babies
acquired their flora

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:84%
from the hands of people
who look after them,

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:84%
from the nipples of the mother,
from the skin of the mother,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:90%
from the environment.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:84%
That's why research shows
that the c-section babies have

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:84%
a much lower diversity of
microbes in their gut flora.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So their gut flora
is also damaged right

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Breastfeeding went out of
fashion at the same time,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:84%
as all the formula feeding
came out in the market.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:84%
Breastfeeding is
essential for the baby

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to develop normal,
healthy, diverse gut flora.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.650 align:middle line:10%
Children who are bottle fed
develop completely different

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.219 align:middle line:10%
gut flora from children
who were breastfed.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:10%
And that abnormal gut
flora in the child

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:10%
predisposes them
usually to allergies,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.170 align:middle line:10%
to asthma, eczema, and
learning disabilities,

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.450 align:middle line:10%
and various other problems.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:10%
When I started practicing
as a medical doctor,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:10%
we were diagnosing one
child in 10,000 with autism.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.687 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I was studying,
when I was a medical student,

00:35:12.687 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:90%
there were no autistic children.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:90%
We haven't seen one.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There were no autistic children
to show to us as students when

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:90%
we were studying psychiatry.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:90%
It was so rare.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Today, in the
English-speaking world,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.620 align:middle line:84%
we are diagnosing
one child in 35, 36.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.930 align:middle line:84%
If that's not an epidemic,
I don't know what is.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists have already
projected that line to 2020s,

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're predicting that
we will be soon diagnosing

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.790 align:middle line:90%
one child in two with autism.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going
to stop there.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.400 align:middle line:90%
It will continue increasing.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:90%
How does a child develop autism?

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt that almost
100% of autistic children

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
today were born with a
perfectly normal brain.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
These were perfectly
normal babies.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But they acquired abnormal
gut flora from day one

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
from their parents,
and that gut flora

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
turned their digestive system
into a major source of toxicity

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.580 align:middle line:84%
The child's brain is clogged
with toxins coming out

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:90%
of the digestive system.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.570 align:middle line:84%
All the information coming
out of the sensory organs,

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:27.630 align:middle line:84%
from the ears, eyes, tactile
sensitivity, and so on,

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:84%
turns into a noise
in the child's brain.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And from that noise, the
child cannot derive any useful

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So in order to help all of these
children, what we need to do,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:84%
we need to start from
the digestive system.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to drive out
pathogenic microbes.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.640 align:middle line:84%
We need to restore
the normal balance

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.270 align:middle line:90%
of microbes in the gut flora.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
We need to heal and
seal the gut wall,

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:84%
close all those
holes in the gut wall

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:90%
so the toxins stop leaking out.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:84%
GAPS diet is quite easy
to cook and to prepare.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It is based on those traditional
diets from indigenous cultures

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.760 align:middle line:84%
We begin from the easiest
to digest foods and the most

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:90%
healing foods.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The most healing
foods in the GAPS diet

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:21.830 align:middle line:84%
are homemade meat stock,
homemade soups, stews,

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.370 align:middle line:84%
cooked vegetables
and fermented foods.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:90%
This is the most healing foods.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.720 align:middle line:84%
This allows us to
rebuild new gut lining,

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.080 align:middle line:84%
rebuild new digestive
system fairly rapidly.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
that river of toxicity

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:84%
stops coming from
the gut to the brain,

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and the brain cleanses itself.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:84%
From that moment on, the child
comes out of the toxic form

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and starts learning.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
The younger the child is
when that moment happens,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
the quicker children recover
and the more fully they recover.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So children under
the age of 4 and 1/2,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.680 align:middle line:84%
maximum five, in my
clinic, many of them

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:90%
recovered from autism fully.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:84%
They have a real ability
to shake autism off,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.470 align:middle line:84%
to learn, to catch up, and
just start developing normally.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.584 align:middle line:90%
It is reversible.

They actually bury it under
the hot sand by the coals,

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and after about 10 or 15
minutes, we bring it out.

Materially, they may be less
affluent than us in the West.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:84%

Mediterranean-style
diet, or social support.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%

the study found

that a third of those
patients in the dietary group

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.730 align:middle line:84%
met criteria for remission

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%

the man who did the first
fecal transplant in Colorado.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And this guy was brilliant.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was hitting a problem,
in that post-surgery he

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:84%
would give antibiotics
to someone who had had,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.230 align:middle line:84%
say, an operation in
the abdomen and they've

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.510 align:middle line:84%
got a bit of pneumonia,
they were given antibiotics,

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and then the patient
develops diarrhea.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And they would develop
diarrhea with what's

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:15.620 align:middle line:10%
called pseudomembranous colitis,
so severe that in that paper,

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:10%
the death rate was 74% of those
who developed pseudomembranous

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.220 align:middle line:10%
colitis.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.020 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And he had this idea of
doing a fecal impact.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So the first case out of
four-- and four out of four was

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.210 align:middle line:90%
dramatic--

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.660 align:middle line:84%
was given one enema,
a second enema.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And the patient,
as they described,

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:38.250 align:middle line:84%
was in the terminal stages of
his terrible illness, something

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Within 24 hours, the
diarrhea went away.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Another enema, and the patient
was discharged 10 days later,

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:84%
having spent like 46
days in intensive care,

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:90%
but under specialists, doctors.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.320 align:middle line:90%
What fixed him?

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:90%

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't a specialist's
poo either.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a nurse's poo.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're more on
the cutting edge

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.220 align:middle line:90%
of figuring out what works.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, we treated
three patients this year

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:11.080 align:middle line:84%
with constipation,
and we were surprised

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.770 align:middle line:90%
that their MS disappeared.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.800 align:middle line:84%
We write them up as three
cases where MS was reversed.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.980 align:middle line:90%
We did all the MRIs.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:23.120 align:middle line:84%
We had a couple of patients
with Parkinson's who

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.070 align:middle line:84%
were re-examined
by the neurologist

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and can't find any
Parkinson's anymore.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's going to
be a lot of changes occurring

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:90%
in the way we practice medicine.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in the past, there was
some divided among specialties,

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.580 align:middle line:84%
but now we're crossing
specialties, you know?

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.920 align:middle line:84%
If you do an FMT and a
neurological condition

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:84%
gets reversed, the
neurologists are

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.870 align:middle line:84%
going to start practicing
fecal transplantation.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:90%
They will.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
When there's a "crapsule," as
we call it, to be prescribed,

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.420 align:middle line:90%
of course, they will do that.

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.030 align:middle line:84%
There may be some
pure floras from which

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
we will extract bacteria that
may reverse, say, diabetes.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's very much in the cards.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:06.790 align:middle line:84%
There are bacteria that can
increase your metabolism

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and reverse obesity.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So I've got all
hopes for components

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.010 align:middle line:84%
of these untainted
gut floras, but we'd

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:21.140 align:middle line:84%
love to have some pure, really
primordial never previously

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.020 align:middle line:84%
exposed to antibiotics
gut flora donors.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:90%

00:49:08.318 --> 00:49:09.860 align:middle line:84%
lace the arrows with
that we're going

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:90%
to use when we go hunting.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It comes from this worm
found in the marula tree.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And the guys are going to prep
it now and then actually put it

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.580 align:middle line:90%
on arrows.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The poisonous concoction is
so dangerous it can bring down

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.830 align:middle line:90%
a fully grown giraffe.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The hunters are very
careful when handling it,

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.800 align:middle line:84%
ensuring they have no open cuts
through which the poison can

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.760 align:middle line:90%
enter the bloodstream.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:10%
In the same way
they're doing here,

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.900 align:middle line:10%
in the past, the older mans,
they was come close together

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:10%
like this, and they sit and
apply the poison to the arrows.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:49.400 align:middle line:10%
And the next man, which is
coming to them, when he come,

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:10%
he make a mistake, and
the poison stab his feet.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.110 align:middle line:10%
They tried to give
him the medicines,

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:10%
but it was a problem.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:02.616 align:middle line:10%
Just one minute,
then the persons die.

00:50:02.616 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> In one minute they died?

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Needless to say, I leave
this one to the experts.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And while the hunters
apply the poison,

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I get a lesson in shooting, with
the beginner arrows, of course.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.005 align:middle line:90%
>> And you pull it.

00:50:16.005 --> 00:50:20.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so like this?

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Like that and then, yeah.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Like that?

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I think that side.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:33.717 align:middle line:90%


00:50:33.717 --> 00:50:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:84%
The hunt is loosely
led by the eldest

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of the group, a man of
almost 70 years of age.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.250 align:middle line:84%
The old man leads because
he is the teacher.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.780 align:middle line:84%
He has the most experience
and can offer wisdom

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:90%
during the hunt.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.038 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.038 --> 00:50:56.002 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So we've just found some
tracks for a kudu, which

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.940 align:middle line:90%
are fresh from this morning.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.546 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're going
to try and track the kudu

00:51:13.546 --> 00:51:17.360 align:middle line:90%
and follow along.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.205 align:middle line:90%
I'm quite nervous and excited.

00:51:21.205 --> 00:51:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm really letting the
experts go ahead a little bit

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.308 align:middle line:84%
because I think we're
getting closer to the animal.

00:51:28.308 --> 00:51:30.100 align:middle line:84%
It's still quite
nerve-wracking because I'm

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:34.990 align:middle line:84%
carrying deathly poisonous
arrows, a spear with which I

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:90%
don't really know what to do.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.552 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still hoping we get one.

00:51:39.552 --> 00:51:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We walk for hours following
what looked like ambiguous marks

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:90%
in the earth.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.020 align:middle line:84%
However, the hunters assure me
that the kudu is not far ahead.

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.160 align:middle line:90%
It's just on the move.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:00.410 align:middle line:84%
As we close in on the kudu, the
San become tense and serious.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.390 align:middle line:84%
They whisper
instructions to the group

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and move forward towards
the sound of the kudu.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:24.750 align:middle line:90%
The hunters urge me onward.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
all I can think about

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is why the inexperienced
tourist with the white clothes,

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.410 align:middle line:84%
holding a spear he
doesn't know how to use,

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:34.330 align:middle line:90%
is heading up the kudu hunt.

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'm so lost in the
moment that I move anyway.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.980 align:middle line:84%
The hunters stalk
forward, moving as close

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.240 align:middle line:90%
as they can to the kudu.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:90%
They're about to fire.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The kudu escapes, and we
must walk home empty-handed.

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The sourness I feel
at missing the kudu

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
slowly dissipates
into a realization

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:19.460 align:middle line:84%
that the San way of life
would say to let it go.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The reality of San life is that
animal protein is a rare treat.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And thus, a diet
rich in plant foods

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.770 align:middle line:84%
is what's necessary
for them to survive.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think there might
be a lesson in that, too.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, so it's the last day.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.280 align:middle line:90%
We're going to test my poo.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.632 align:middle line:90%

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a sad goodbye, but we
must head home to Australia

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.820 align:middle line:84%
to find out just
what sort of bacteria

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and other microbes the San
have present in their gut.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I wonder also how my
microbiome has changed

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.060 align:middle line:90%
while spending time here.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Before we leave though, there
is one last thing I have to do.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Could I order a
kudu steak, please?

00:54:23.372 --> 00:54:24.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Steak?

00:54:24.172 --> 00:54:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I know what I'm having.

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so it's not the
same as what we wanted.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.610 align:middle line:84%

to suffice for now.

>> So what have we got?

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at the major
players in your gut microbiome.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is before you went,
and this is when you came back.

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:31.760 align:middle line:84%

kind of microbiome transplant

and Africa, you know?

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It's been a big shift
in your microbiome.

>> In only one
week with the San,

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.410 align:middle line:84%
my microbiome has shifted
from a low range of diversity,

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:45.320 align:middle line:84%
which is associated
with poor health,

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.390 align:middle line:90%
into a much higher range.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:52.754 align:middle line:84%

of the African people,
with their microbiomes.

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So you've really increased
your biodiversity

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.450 align:middle line:84%
in a very healthful
way during that time.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> From what you found
of their microbiomes,

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.580 align:middle line:84%
what could you sort of
ascertain that they eat?

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, their diet
looks to be very,

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:25.125 align:middle line:84%
very different to what
an Australian diet is.

00:56:25.125 --> 00:56:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
seeing that shift.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:31.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have probably a
lot more plant-based nutrition

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:33.290 align:middle line:90%
in there as well.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Their gut PH looks to be really
nice because Bacteroidetes

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.630 align:middle line:10%
are expanded.

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different sort of profile.

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The San, on average,
had significantly healthier

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.240 align:middle line:84%
microbiome samples compared
to the average Australian,

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:90%
myself included.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.780 align:middle line:10%
Their inflammatory
microbes are vastly

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:53.900 align:middle line:10%
outweighed by
anti-inflammatory microbes.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And their microbial
diversity is much more varied

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:58.910 align:middle line:90%
than us in the West.

00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:01.520 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, though, after
a week living with them,

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.812 align:middle line:84%
my own diversity had begun
to match that of the San.

00:57:05.812 --> 00:57:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's fascinating.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:09.673 align:middle line:90%
I'm speechless.

00:57:09.673 --> 00:57:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to say about it.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:11.890 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

so much to take away from these

Firstly, I love the
fact that food alone

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.810 align:middle line:90%
can change the microbiome.

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:36.102 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I love the
speed at which it changes.

00:57:36.102 --> 00:57:37.560 align:middle line:84%
A little change in
your environment

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.720 align:middle line:84%
results in a big
change in your body.

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And you can magnify that.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And you should be
encouraged by that.

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.713 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so excited
about what we learned.

00:57:44.713 --> 00:57:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that we all
have to go to Africa to change

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.330 align:middle line:90%
our microbiome, right?

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:51.270 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that we can
change our dietary intake,

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:52.920 align:middle line:90%
we can improve our microbiome.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Whether those bacteria survive
when you got back to Australia,

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:58.030 align:middle line:90%
I truly don't know.

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's probably a little bit
doubtful because, remember,

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.492 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer sampling
their environment.

00:58:02.492 --> 00:58:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The greatest thing that we
see from this is that you can

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:07.360 align:middle line:84%
change your gut by
changing your environment.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And you may not need
to take a supplement.

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.670 align:middle line:84%
These days, we're looking
for capsules and powders

00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things, but
maybe if we kept it simple

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and just go down to the park
or went out into nature,

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:19.620 align:middle line:84%
rode our bike, or
crawled in the mud,

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.150 align:middle line:84%
things could be
really good for us.

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Mother nature created our
bodies to get our nutrition

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.650 align:middle line:90%
from food, not from pills.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Food industry has
changed all our recipes

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:90%
to suit its commercial agenda.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because your health is not
on their agenda at all.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not responsible
for your health.

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Get in the car, drive
outside the city,

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.300 align:middle line:84%
find organic mixed
farms, introduce yourself

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to these people, and
start buying directly

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:45.930 align:middle line:90%
from these farms.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Cook everything from
fresh ingredients.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Buy everything in
the shape and form

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.960 align:middle line:90%
that mother nature created it.

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Do not buy any
processed ingredients.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Nothing processed is bought.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:59:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in tins or
packets or powders

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:03.320 align:middle line:84%
or in any kind of
processed shape or form.

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're providing the
right quality materials,

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're controlling
your gut flora,

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:10.920 align:middle line:84%
making sure that it's
dominated by beneficial species

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.890 align:middle line:84%
of microbes, then your
body has a real chance

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild itself from
quality materials,

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:21.610 align:middle line:84%
from quality, healthy,
vibrant young cells.

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you will have a
healthy liver and a healthy gut

00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:26.940 align:middle line:84%
wall and healthy lungs
and healthy heart

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and healthy brain.

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult to change
the diet in your family.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it is
difficult. It's hard work.

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
doing when you're

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.330 align:middle line:84%
changing the diet
in your children

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and in the whole family, you
are laying a solid foundation

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:46.320 align:middle line:90%
for a happy, successful life.

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.570 align:middle line:84%
When you start
changing the diet,

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and when you are firm and strong
with it, and you don't back up,

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you are taking that power
back into your own hands,

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and you lay a wonderful
foundation for your children

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.815 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy and well for
the rest of their lives.

01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:06.980 align:middle line:90%


01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think an optimal microbiome
exists, but it's not one.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's multiple,
and it's unclear

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it's tens,
hundreds, thousands

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:22.450 align:middle line:84%
of different signatures that can
support optimal human health.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It's very likely that we can
see traditional societies

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
with very different microbiota
that still support health.

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If your diet's very
narrow, and it's very white,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.997 align:middle line:84%
and very simple, then maybe
what you could do is increase

01:00:37.997 --> 01:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
the different colors and the
different variety of fruits

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables that go into
your diet so that you're getting

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
a broader variety to feed
different types of bacteria

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:47.260 align:middle line:90%
in your microbiome.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Whole food, high fiber diets.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:50.290 align:middle line:90%
So lots and lots of fiber.

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need to
feed our microbiome.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:54.580 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about real food.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.290 align:middle line:90%
So it grew in the ground.

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It didn't come out of a packet.

01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It was once alive, and
you can actually recognize

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%
what it is on your plate.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.000 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do that,
probably not a good idea

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.358 align:middle line:90%
to put it in your mouth.

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Because modern medicine
is good at keeping you alive

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:12.040 align:middle line:10%
for a long time, the
real question is,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.590 align:middle line:10%
do you want to thrive
during that time?

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to thrive
during your 80 years here,

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and do you want to maybe
even make it to 120?

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.247 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the optimal
microbiome does exist.

01:01:22.247 --> 01:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
we've found it yet.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.455 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
the biggest problem

01:01:25.455 --> 01:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
because we're striving
for this perfection,

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
but we don't really
know where to start.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that there is
any one optimal microbiome.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
The good quote unquote, "bugs
in you" that do a set of jobs,

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
if you like, in your
gut may be totally

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:47.087 align:middle line:84%
different to the good bugs in
me that are doing the same jobs.

01:01:47.087 --> 01:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you want
to lose the weight?

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want to
be around longer?

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And why do you want to thrive?

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it so you can see
your grandkids grow up?

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.595 align:middle line:84%
Is it so you can walk your son
down the aisle at his wedding?

01:01:57.595 --> 01:01:58.720 align:middle line:90%
All these different things.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.450 align:middle line:10%
That's really where this becomes
very important, because that's

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.075 align:middle line:10%
what some of these
cultures are getting

01:02:03.075 --> 01:02:05.140 align:middle line:10%
who have this great health.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't die from cancer--

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:09.380 align:middle line:90%
the Okinawans, the Ikarians.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
They're experiencing
amazing health.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I see someone with
an imbalanced microbiome,

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that with the
correct application of diet

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and lifestyle we can shift
that microbiome very quickly.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
That means that we're going
to have a positive impact

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.500 align:middle line:90%
on that person's life.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.740 align:middle line:10%
>> My gut feeling trying to look
around the corner will be that

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.300 align:middle line:10%
there will be a lot of
microbiomes that are compatible

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.100 align:middle line:10%
with health.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.517 align:middle line:90%


01:02:36.517 --> 01:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Just like there's a lot
of different people.

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
You can have short, tall,
fat, and they're quite

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:41.990 align:middle line:90%
compatible with normal health.

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:46.280 align:middle line:90%


01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's a collection
of bugs, and some

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
will have these missing,
some will have those missing,

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.828 align:middle line:90%
but they'll still be healthy.

01:02:51.828 --> 01:02:57.460 align:middle line:90%


01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's like medicine
come alive, you know?

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to
realize we just don't know

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:03.610 align:middle line:90%
shh-- about shh--, you know?

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
