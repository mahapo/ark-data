>>I was talking on the phone.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The lightening came down
the phone, entered my neck.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It went through my spine.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.020 align:middle line:10%
Threw me up in the air.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
And there was this
slight buzzing at the ear

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:10%
and I felt myself
pop out of the body.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.936 align:middle line:84%
Then I felt myself
float up to the ceiling.

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor and the
nurse were in there,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and he was looking at
me, say, "She's gone.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:90%
She's dead."

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>And I was taken to hospital.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Doctors did anything
they could to help me,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:90%
but I was declared dead.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>I realized I
was out of my body

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
when I was suddenly
looking at the slide.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Out of that light stepped
a most amazing being

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I have ever been
in the presence of.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:10%
>>It was just total
selflessness, understanding,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:10%
kindness, all consuming love.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.345 align:middle line:10%
Wonderful love!

00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:90%

>>After a time in this
light, all of these people

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:90%
have to pay a return trip back.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:10%
What they tell us is that the
reason they chose to come back

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:10%
was not for themselves,
because for themselves

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:10%
they would rather have stayed
with this presence of love.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:10%
When they do return,
incidentally, then the story

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
becomes very interesting
from the point

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:10%
of view of human
psychology, because we

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:10%
find that these patients
are profoundly changed.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That they are imbued with a
totally new value structure.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:10%
That whatever in
their lives before,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:10%
they had been chasing, whether
it was money or power or fame

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:10%
or any of these other
things that people seek,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:10%
they say that after
this experience,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:10%
their value primarily
is to love others,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:10%
to seek loving relationships
with their fellow human being.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:10%
And also they tell
us that they have

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.685 align:middle line:10%
no more fear of
death whatsoever.

00:02:48.685 --> 00:03:16.978 align:middle line:90%

00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:25.444 align:middle line:90%
>>The phone just went off.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello?

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hey mom.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh no, what's a matter?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.154 align:middle line:90%
What-- what's happened to him?

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:39.609 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked when I
got that phone call,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
one that nobody ever wants or
ever really expects to get.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.084 align:middle line:84%
There's just so many feelings
that I really want to share.

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:58.486 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to be there.

00:03:58.486 --> 00:04:00.416 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:00.916 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:05.902 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll see you soon.

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.798 align:middle line:90%
Mom, I love you.

00:04:07.798 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
My dad was fighting for
every breath of life,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't look very hopeful.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Even though we lived
600 miles apart,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and only saw each other
on holidays, at least

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
we were on the same planet.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And we could pick up
the phone and say hello.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
The likelihood of
losing all that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.275 align:middle line:84%
seemed almost
impossible to grasp.

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:43.036 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.008 align:middle line:90%
"Dear dad.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm so sorry to hear about
what you're going through.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:05.005 align:middle line:84%
I know you're rugged, but
you gave us a good scare."

"Dear dad.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing you this
letter because I

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.826 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I'll
ever see you again,

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
yet I have so much
I want to say.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Dad, do you remember
several years

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
ago when I was still grieving
over the death of Suzanne?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I found a great deal of
comfort in some books

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:90%
I was reading about dying."

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.762 align:middle line:84%
"It was at that time that I
met a doctor of psychiatry,

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:84%
a researcher named
Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending a copy
of a book that he

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
wrote, which was a great
deal of help to me then."

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
"Dr. Moody has
observed a pattern

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that occurs in people
the world over,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
regardless of their
culture or religion."

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:10%
>>As a matter of fact, the
prior religious beliefs

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:10%
or background of
the person doesn't

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:10%
seem to have much to
do with whether or not

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:10%
they have an
experience, and even

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:10%
the content of the experience.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
We've even had people who say
that prior to their experience

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
they were atheists
or agnostics who

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.755 align:middle line:84%
have very beautiful and
full-blown near death

00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:11.255 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Really.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And do they remain
atheists and agnostics?

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Not at all.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Once they come
back, they tell us

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that they're totally transformed
and they have no more doubt,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever that there
is a God and there

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:90%
is a life after death.

>>"It's about his research
on the stories of people

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
who have approached
death, many of whom

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
actually had the
experience of dying

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and then were revived and
lived to tell about it."

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>What happened is I felt like
I had been hit by a train.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:10%
But what had happened was
I was talking on the phone,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:10%
holding the telephone like this.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.594 align:middle line:10%
The lightening came down
the phone, entered my neck.

00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It went through my spine,
threw me up in the air.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
As it threw me in the air,
it knocked me out of my shoes

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and welded the nails in the
heels of my shoes to the nails

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
in the floor, which is how I was
grounded and I didn't explode.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Before I shot
myself I measured,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:10%
like we did in CPR, to
find where the heart was.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.005 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
just took the barrel

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and put it up against my
chest and pulled the trigger.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.445 align:middle line:90%
>>I had responded to treatment.

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I was getting worse, and
the doctor had come to see.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:10%
And at this point, he
says I've lost her.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:10%
She's gone.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well
who's he talking about?

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Just before this, I had
been in terrible pain.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I was just hurting so bad.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get away from it.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:10%
>>15 minutes before I was
to be picked up by a jeep,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:10%
I was discovered to have a
temperature of 106 and a half.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And instead of
waiting for the jeep,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:10%
the captain in charge of the
ward send me over to X-ray.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.485 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I remember
was the captain in charge

00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
of X-ray asked me if I
thought I could sit up

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.424 align:middle line:84%
long enough for them to
get a picture of my chest.

00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And I remember hearing
that X-ray making

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.048 align:middle line:84%
that peculiar whirring
sound, and then a click.

00:08:13.048 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm told that I
collapsed in a heap.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:10%
>>This wasn't a typical
bee sting because I quickly

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:10%
realized that there
was a problem.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:10%
And I tried to telephone
someone for help.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the ranger station
was about three miles in,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to telephone
my boss to send some help.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:90%
And I fell and went unconscious.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, from what
I understand, he

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
drove through, a bus drove
through a little while

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
later and noticed that-- I would
normally just wave to him as he

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
came by, and I was
lying down on the floor,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and he called the ambulance.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I was a dissident
in Soviet Union.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And I had an invitation
from United States.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:84%
In 1975 I received
this invitation.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
In 1976 I was given
the exit visa,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and I was leaving for
New York that day.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was coming to
take my passport,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
and I was ready to fly.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
My family was already in
airport waiting for me.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
The time on sidewalk, I was
moved over or ran over by car.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It was fabricated by KGB.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to kill me,
and not to let me go.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And I was taken to hospital.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Doctors did anything
they could to help me,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:90%
but I was declared dead.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Pretty much all over the world
we found this common pattern.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that at this
point where their doctor says

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
they are dead, that
they may actually

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
hear the physician
say, oh my, he's dead,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
or we've lost her or
something like that.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And they say that from
their perspective, actually,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:90%
they still feel very much alive.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.645 align:middle line:84%
Indeed their consciousness
is heightened.

00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>And they tell
us that they seem

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to leave their physical bodies.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
float up, typically

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
right above the bed
in the operating

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
room, or the emergency
room, and they look down

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and they can see their
own physical bodies

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:90%
lying on the bed down below.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:10%
>>I was above my body.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.932 align:middle line:10%
I was floating.

00:10:54.932 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And there were people
around me, except I

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize that that
person there was me.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Then all of a sudden I heard
this statement, he's gone.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was the paramedic making
that statement to the driver.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
At that point I was standing
behind the paramedic.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I was watching him
work on my body.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>And suddenly there was
commotion beneath me,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and then I started noticing all
of the people underneath me.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And the EMS workers were pushing
the stretcher down the hall.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I really wasn't
concerned with my body.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I was more concerned with there
were a couple of plainclothes

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
policemen over
where the guns were,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and they were-- one of them
was wrong about something

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to tell
him that he was wrong.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I could see the soldiers and
the nurses and the doctors,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:90%
but they could not see me.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I went from
ward to ward, bed

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
to bed trying to find a
soldier that I thought

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that looked like me
lying in the bed.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.382 align:middle line:84%
Was becoming more and more
desperate because, as I say,

00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I could see these human
beings, but I could not

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:90%
communicate with them.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I finally went into this
little isolated ward room.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, lying in the
bed with a sheet pulled up

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
over the head was
this body that I

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
had to recognize
as me because it

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
had my fraternity
ring on its finger.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>And there was this
slight buzzing at the ear,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and at felt myself
pop out of the body.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I was-- I don't
know how I came out.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I was just suddenly
out of the body.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down on the
head of the bed a minute

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:90%
to look around.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Then I felt myself
float up to the ceiling

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and I was looking down.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And he said, she's gone.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.021 align:middle line:90%
And I thought well, who's gone?

00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
look down to see.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I felt presences
with me, guardian angels

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is what they were, but
I called them guides.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>I was suddenly looking
at the slide that

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be in the
corner of the room.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing I thought
was where did you come from?

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I've
always been here,

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
but you weren't able
to see me before.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
She emanated feelings
of selflessness, love,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
all consuming love,
understanding, kindness.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
She took on all the pain
and all the suffering

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
with total understanding of what
had brought me to that point.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was like we
were intertwined.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And that everything that
I felt, she felt too.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.865 align:middle line:84%
Because she understood the
motivation behind what I did.

00:13:50.865 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>After a while
in this, they say

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that they begin to feel an
indescribable feeling of bliss.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
That it's something
that transcends words,

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can't put
it into the language

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
that we have in everyday life.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
One man, for instance,
told me that,

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:84%
although he was in
great pain in his chest

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
prior to leaving his body,
as soon as he left his body,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.905 align:middle line:84%
that he was overcome with
a tremendous sense of joy

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:90%
A kind of ecstasy.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>There was absolute freedom
of your soul and body.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:90%
And this amazed me.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
interesting, too.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I was happy to be
in such experience

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because I could
see their thoughts.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I could see everything
what was happening.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I could smell!

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I could hear, and I
could see their thoughts.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This was the main
thing what was very,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:90%
very making me happy and proud.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this word is
good to use here or not,

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
but a proud of that I
can see their thoughts.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>But I can remember that it
felt very exciting to be above,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and to be out and looking down,
and not threatening at all.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Then I knew I was supposed
to be keeping up with my body,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:84%
so I followed my
body through the hall

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and out the front door.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's
something about being

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
outside when you're
out of your body.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I got outside I
just-- it was just wonderful.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed like I
was always just kind

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of looking through the
ambulance because I

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.798 align:middle line:90%
was enjoying being outside.

00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Just really kind of
a nice experience

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.835 align:middle line:84%
with the lights and everything,
and the feeling of lightness.

00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>As I have come
out, I'm in no pain,

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also just
free of everything.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm no one's wife,
mother or daughter.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm just myself alone.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>I have the distinct memory of
always trying to look at myself

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and thinking how
much better looking

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was than that,
because this guy was ugly,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
he was in trouble, and
he had these blue lines

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
all down his face.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy, truly happy
to be away from that body.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
They could have it.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And I did not feel one
bit of remorse or sadness,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:90%
no matter what had happened.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>But it was not bothering me.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I saw my body and I hated it.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to come to my back.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>It looked like this sort
of a feeble sick person.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't dawn
on me until it

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
seemed like many minutes later--
I'm sure it was a flash--

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:90%
that that person was me.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And that they were trying to
revive me because I was dying.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, my
heart had stopped.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a skeptical
part of me, too.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder sometimes
whether or not

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.890 align:middle line:84%
this might just be people's
hallucinations that they're

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
going through, or just
a natural shutting down

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.924 align:middle line:90%
process when the brain is dying.

00:17:20.924 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Um-hmm.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I used to wonder about
that myself, Peter.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
What has turned me around on
that issue is that so often

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
these patients are
able to give us

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:84%
very correct descriptions
of what was going on

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
during the resuscitation
from a point of view

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.005 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't have had
from that perspective

00:17:39.005 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
of that physical body
lying on the table.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
For instance, my friend Kim, who
works in a medical University

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
out West, was
telling me that she

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:84%
was involved in resuscitating
a young patient named Maria.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And Maria had been
believed dead,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:90%
but was successfully revived.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And when she came
back to consciousness,

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:08.780 align:middle line:84%
my friend Kim happened to be
standing there by her bedside.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And Maria grabbed
onto Kim and said,

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
during the resuscitation
when she was out of her body,

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
she drifted outside
of the hospital

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
entirely and saw an
old shoe on a ledge

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:84%
on a window outside an
upper floor at the hospital.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And Kim was actually
able to go there

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and to verify that
the shoe was there

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
exactly as the
patient had specified.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Really.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>And all of a sudden I'm aware
of people out in the hall.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.103 align:middle line:84%
The room had been
sealed off because he

00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
was going to do
surgery in the room.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately went
out through the door--

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:90%
did not open it, just went out.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately on the other
side of them in the hall.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But I go up to my daughter
and I try to make her hear me,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:84%
"Cassie, go home and
change your clothes."

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.394 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make her hear
me, so I went to her dad,

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.629 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Judd,
take Cassie home.

00:19:07.629 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Change her clothes.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:90%
She shouldn't be out like this."

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
While they were
in the hall, when

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to send them
home, a brother of my husband's

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
came up and he
was talking to him

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
and he had gotten word to come.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of his neighbors
was also in the hospital,

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and he came up and started
talking to my brother,

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
[? Neil, ?] wanting to know what
he was doing at the hospital,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and what he was going
to do that weekend.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, it looks
like my sister-in-law is

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
going to kick the bucket, and
I was planning to go to Athens,

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
but I'll stick around
now to be a pallbearer."

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Later, I was also
able to talk to him.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
admit it, but he

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
did admit this is
what he had said.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed at him
because it embarrassed him.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>It was amazing that I was
never leaving my body, too.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I was everywhere who
thought about me.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:90%
But I was with my body.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It means that I was not
leaving one part for another.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I was everywhere the same time.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I could be in New York, I
could be in Longview, Texas.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I could be in Moscow, I
could be in Tbilisi, Georgia.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:90%
In any place.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
There was no distance and
time at that time with me.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>And this time I'm thinking
I want to see my sister.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.075 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately find myself
in Rockville, Maryland

00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
at her home, and she's getting
ready to go grocery shopping.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
She's wearing a beige
suit with a green blouse.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
She's had to go over the
house and look for her keys

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:90%
that she had misplaced.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Had to find her grocery list.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And finally she walks
out her front door

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to get in her blue
Monte Carlo Chevrolet.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And I feel there's no need for
me to go to the grocery store

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%
with her, so I let her go on.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to pop over
then to another sister who

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:90%
lives a few miles away from her.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And this other sister
had already left home.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I was able to determine she had
gone grocery shopping herself.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So the guides asked me was
I ready to leave this area,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.232 align:middle line:90%
and I agreed and said yes.

00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
About two weeks after I had
this near death experience,

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I was in contact with my sisters
and I brought this fact up

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:90%
to her and described.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Well,
how did you know?

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see you.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:90%
You weren't here."

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>I could communicate
with the children,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
with very little children
who couldn't speak

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and who couldn't walk
and who were very little.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And just coming from that
place where I was going.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And this was amazing
communication

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
with them, a spiritual
communication.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:90%
We never spoken in the words.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
We spoke in a mental
communication.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And she had broken
hip, and nobody

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
understood why she
was crying so loud.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors
and these parents

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:90%
were very concerned about this.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Don't cry anyway.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will understand
why do you cry."

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And she stopped
crying and she smiled.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredible experience
for the people who were around,

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and they looked at her and
said, "What's happened?

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Why she's not crying
at this time?"

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell them that
she has this di-- This

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:90%
happened with her.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't
communicate with them.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
At the third day when I was back
to my body and after three days

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.310 align:middle line:84%
when I could speak, I said
them that your daughter

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:90%
is crying because of this.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:90%
She has a broken hip.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:05.555 align:middle line:84%
And this is the diagnosis
which you are seeking.

00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:08.335 align:middle line:84%
And they found
that it was truth.

00:23:08.335 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
They were shocked and
they were surprised.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I've also wondered whether
or not people may not just

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
be going to places that they've
known before in their memory.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, they certainly do that.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
They do go to places
where they have them,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
but they also fairly
frequently end up in places

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't know
existed on the way.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And in one case,
Dr. George Ritchie,

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
he was actually
able to find a place

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that he had seen in his
out of body experience.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>I had left that room.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Went as far as
Vicksburg, Mississippi.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Saw a man getting ready to go
into a white all night cafe

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
there on DeCarlo
Street in Vicksburg,

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and asked him if
he could tell me

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:84%
if I was going in the right
direction to get to Richmond.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And this man acted the
same way that a ward boy

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:84%
had in the corridor I past as I
was going out of the hospital,

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
like he could neither
see me nor hear me.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I walked right
through ward boy going out.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But I was so
determined to get back

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
to Richmond, that
never even stopped me.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And when this guy
couldn't see me then

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.704 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there
was a vast change.

00:24:27.704 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Something was wrong that these
people couldn't neither see

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:90%
nor hear me.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The way that I know that it
was Vicksburg, Mississippi

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.450 align:middle line:84%
because 10 months
after this experience

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I came back through
Vicksburg and recognized

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the white all night
cafe on the corner.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Time and distance, as you and
I comprehend it in this room

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
simply does not
exist, because simply

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
by wanting to be heading back
towards Richmond, apparently

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Before I tell you about
the most adventurous kind

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.674 align:middle line:84%
of out of body traveling,
I want you to promise me

00:24:57.674 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that you'll come to visit me and
say goodbye before you actually

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.650 align:middle line:90%
leave this world.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:84%
There are occasional
reports from people

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:84%
who experienced another
dramatic form of traveling.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.220 align:middle line:84%
That they actually leave their
body, zoom up above the Earth,

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and travel far into space
and see the Earth down below.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Carl Jung, the great
Swiss psychiatrist,

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
was an example of
this phenomenon when

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
he had his near death experience
in 1944, and a heart attack.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:10%
>>At the beginning of
1944, I broke my foot,

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:10%
and this misadventure was
followed by a heart attack.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Extremely strange things
began to happen to me.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to me that I
was high up in space.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Far below, I saw the
globe of the Earth, bathed

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%
in a gloriously blue light.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I saw the deep blue
sea and the continents.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I could see the
snow-covered Himalayas.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was at the point
of departing from the Earth.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
The sight of the
Earth from this height

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
was the most glorious
thing I had ever seen.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>After a while
in this situation,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:84%
though, they come to
realize that although they

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
can see and understand
perfectly what's happening,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:84%
no one else is able
to see or hear them.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So they seem to undergo
a state of turning inward

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:84%
of the sense of identity,
if I could call it that.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
They become aware that this
phenomenon they're experiencing

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
has something to do
with what we call death.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's at that point that
the more transcendental parts

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
of the near death
experience tend to unfold.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>I have this pain
and I am in darkness.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see anything.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Then I cannot move hand.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Then I cannot move my body.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I understood that
I have nothing, but I am.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And it scared me.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Fear.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Unknown.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Why are all people
afraid of darkness?

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't know
what is in darkness.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
The fear of darkness
is because of unknown.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.862 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.862 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And understandable makes you
to be afraid of something.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:90%
That's why I was afraid too.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid of this darkness.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid of being there.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But more afraid was that I
was somewhere without my body.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:90%
But I was.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.640 align:middle line:90%
And I was a scientist, you know.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I worked on idea of
psychology and languages.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I learned the physics,
I learned chemistry,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I learned many
other physiologies.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Anatomy.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And all it was based on
dialectical materialism.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Historical materialism.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And in my idea it was
impossible to be somewhere

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:90%
without your body.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Where is my main component?

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:90%
My life?

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:90%
My body?

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:90%
I was scared to death.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:90%
But I was already dead.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was the amazing feeling
to understand that you are,

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:90%
but you are not.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.931 align:middle line:90%
If you think, you are.

00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:90%
If I think, I thought, I am.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But if I am, and if I think,
why cannot I think positively

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:90%
what's happening around me?

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
think about light.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I saw light outside of
darkness, and it shocked me.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The first feeling which I had
was to come to that light.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The first thought which came to
me was to go into this light.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:90%
And I had that movement.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>They describe to
us how they seem

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to be drawn into an
enclosure of some sort.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:90%
They often call it a tunnel.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And they go through this
tunnel quite rapidly

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and they come out
on the other side

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
into an incredibly brilliant
and warm and loving light.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.452 align:middle line:84%
>>Don't know exactly how
I entered the tunnel,

00:29:32.452 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:90%
just at what point.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But it was when the guides
had asked me, and I said yes.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And I feel myself going
in an upward motion.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel is not too big--
just seemed for one person

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:90%
to go one at a time.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't touch
you, or I didn't

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:90%
reach out and touch the walls.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's black, and I feel
myself going up and looking

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:84%
at light, bright light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm going along,
I see the gray area,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
but I did not stop to go in
and see just what was going on.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I went on to come out into this
beautiful pasture, valley land,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:84%
flowers, bright,
beautiful light.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant color.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing here is like it at all.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>The next thing I remember
is I heard a set of chimes.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at an angle,
probably 35 or 40 degrees,

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I could see a tunnel.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel was like
a spiral, like it

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.300 align:middle line:84%
was moving whether
I was moving or not.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to whisk down it,
and I could hear these chimes.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But I was in utter peace,
in utter tranquility.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a stark,
dramatic difference

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:84%
between the way that
body was and what

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.630 align:middle line:84%
was happening to that
body and this place I was,

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:90%
this utter peace.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:84%
As I moved closer
to the light, I

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
was kept being surrounded
and filled with this love.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.450 align:middle line:84%
This love of like--
I can't describe it,

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.689 align:middle line:84%
except when you haven't seen
your parents in a long time.

00:31:10.689 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:84%
If you've been away
from your family,

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and when you first see
your mom and your dad,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that feeling when you're a small
kid, that feeling that you get.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was safe.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.240 align:middle line:90%
I knew everything was peaceful.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it was right.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:84%
As I came into the tunnel,
came through the tunnel,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I came into a place much like
walking out of a dark room

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.080 align:middle line:84%
into a bright
room, as if my eyes

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:84%
were trying to adjust
to this brilliant light.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:84%
The contrast between
the brilliant light

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:84%
of the lightning bolt and
the brilliant light that

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
was in the tunnel was another
thing that was quite dramatic.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Because this light was so
brilliant and so bright,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:84%
it passed through
me, it permeated me.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:90%
It and I became one.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.075 align:middle line:84%
>>For years now, we've
been using the expression

00:31:56.075 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:84%
of seeing the light at
the end of the tunnel.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder whether it
was started, perhaps,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.627 align:middle line:84%
by people who had near death
experiences many years ago.

00:32:05.627 --> 00:32:07.335 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've been
showing some paintings

00:32:07.335 --> 00:32:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of just this scene that were
done several hundred years ago.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:10%
>>In the 15th century,
the Dutch painter,

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:10%
Hieronymus Bosch even painted
this theme in his painting

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.302 align:middle line:10%
"A Scent of the Blessed."

00:32:20.302 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:10%
In the foreground in the
bottom of the painting

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:10%
we see people who are
dying, and as they are dying

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.900 align:middle line:10%
they're surrounded by
spiritual beings who

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:10%
attempt to turn their
attention upwards.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Above them there's
a tunnel, which

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:90%
goes off into the distance.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the tunnel
is a very bright light.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.390 align:middle line:10%
As these people go
through the tunnel,

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:10%
they kneel reverently
into the light.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:10%
So we know then that
these experiences

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:50.250 align:middle line:10%
have existed among human
beings from time immemorial.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>In this light,
they often tell us

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that they see relatives
or friends of theirs who

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
have already died, who seem
to be there to meet them,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and to greet them, and to help
them through this transition.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>A particularly very great
thing happened with me.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:84%
It was that I saw my
parents, my real parents.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that
they were killed.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were killed
by KGB in Moscow,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and I was happy of this.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It sounds very
ridiculous, but you know,

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I was happy because
I was thought

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:90%
that I was abandoned by them.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'd lost a girlfriend in
the polio epidemic in the '30s.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.636 align:middle line:84%
I think it was '38, but I'm
not positive of that date.

00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:44.045 align:middle line:84%
And she assured me that
everything was fine

00:33:44.045 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and she was happy.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And I also saw my grandparents
coming to meet me.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I never known my grandfathers.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
They had both passed
away before I was born.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But I did know my grandmothers,
and my mother also.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And [INAUDIBLE], this
baby appears to me.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "Hi,
I'm your brother."

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I don't
have a brother."

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And we don't talk as
I'm talking to you.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:84%
There was no way of
misunderstanding.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It was more like it
was mental telepathy.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And he shows himself to
me as a small infant,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:28.425 align:middle line:84%
dressed in a cap
and a long dress

00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
with the knitted [? sack ?]
with booties and socks.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.449 align:middle line:84%
And tells me to look me
over now and remember

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.145 align:middle line:90%
how I looked this way.

00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell our
father when you get back

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and he'll tell you it happened.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I was able
to talk to him,

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.159 align:middle line:84%
my dad's, "Well,
I don't know how

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
you know that because nobody
but your mother, doctor and I

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:90%
knew about these things.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>"So it gives me hope to
know that whatever happens,

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.966 align:middle line:84%
we'll be seeing each
other again one day,

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:84%
as we're greeted by those loved
ones, family and friends who

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:90%
have already died.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:84%
All these greeters
seem to be encouraging

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
us to come into the
presence of that light,

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and are letting us know that
everything is going to be OK."

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>The being of light
that these patients often

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.040 align:middle line:84%
describe encountering is
plainly a personal being.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
are in the presence

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of a being of complete love,
who accepts them and loves them

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.230 align:middle line:90%
totally.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And who has a
wonderful personality,

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is very knowledgeable about
them, very wise, very helpful.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Also, has a wonderful
sense of humor.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:03.144 align:middle line:90%


00:36:03.144 --> 00:36:07.116 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the most
wonderful part of it.

00:36:07.116 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:90%
This is a warm, loving light.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
masculine, but it also

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:84%
has overtones of mother
love, sisterly love.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
This just pulsates around.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:25.175 align:middle line:84%
He has totally accepted
me, and forgiven me

00:36:25.175 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
for everything I've ever
done, but can I forgive myself

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:84%
for some of these selfish
things I have done.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>And there was this
unconditional love,

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:40.290 align:middle line:84%
like most parents have
for their children.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:84%
That no matter how
bad I might have been

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:50.410 align:middle line:84%
or-- that I was totally
loved, and totally understood,

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:55.264 align:middle line:90%
and just wonderful love!

00:36:55.264 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm sitting there
wondering what

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to do next, when suddenly that
room became flooded with light.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And then three things happened
simultaneously just like that.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.922 align:middle line:84%
Something deep inside of
the spiritual being sitting

00:37:06.922 --> 00:37:09.505 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the bed looking
at the corpse lying in the bed,

00:37:09.505 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:84%
was told to stand up in the
presence of the Son of God.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Out of that light stepped
a most amazing being

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I have ever been
in the presence of.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.790 align:middle line:84%
The most powerfully built
male I have ever seen.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>To my right I saw a
being coming toward me.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.905 align:middle line:84%
In those days, I had never
heard of the death experience,

00:37:27.905 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:84%
so I haven't had
it described to me,

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.494 align:middle line:84%
so I had no idea
how to relate to it.

00:37:32.494 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Since then I've heard
people describe it

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
as God and Jesus
or Moses or lots

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of different names,
a great Angel.

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this being
of light was my higher self.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.430 align:middle line:84%
The greater part of me
looking at the part of me

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.720 align:middle line:90%
that just experienced this life.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I was so comfortable
with this being

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and so assured that
only if someone

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:84%
knew themselves and knew the
Love of God in them, then

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:84%
they could have that same
relationship with themselves.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if this being
had come to be with me.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>And now once being in
the presence of a being who

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
knows everything about you, to
know that he totally accepts

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you and totally
loves you, I never

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.263 align:middle line:84%
wanted to leave this being
again under any circumstance.

00:38:12.263 --> 00:38:20.365 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.365 --> 00:38:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, this is one of the
most interesting parts

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of the near death
experience to me.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
These patients will tell us
that in the closing moments

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of their life, often in the
presence of this being of love

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:39.230 align:middle line:84%
who is with them, that they see
a panorama before them, which

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.100 align:middle line:84%
consists of every single
thing that they've ever

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.770 align:middle line:84%
done in their lives, from
the moment of their birth,

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
right through the time of
their close call with death.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And they say that they
see it all simultaneously,

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.690 align:middle line:84%
not with the events
in temporal sequence,

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:84%
but rather all display
there at once in a way

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that they find very
difficult to describe.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>As those hospital walls
virtually disappeared

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and I saw every minute
detail of my life,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.920 align:middle line:84%
seen my own cesarean
section birth,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.130 align:middle line:84%
through the 20 years
that I had lived

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:90%
because I was on 20 at the time.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>With the light, there is
this panoramic view of my life.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It starts with
birth, it continues

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:84%
right on to where we
are at this point.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
All at the same time,
I am part of the view.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
As well as watching it, I am
actually viewing these things.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's a speeded up
version of a camera that

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:84%
just runs double
time or something.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But I actually had
the feelings of what

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.600 align:middle line:90%
was going on as I saw it.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And also standing
off to the side

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
look around and look

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:84%
at the different things that
went on at different times

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>I saw all my life, but it's in
that dimension which cannot be

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:90%
described.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:84%
This was holographical view
of being inside of your life,

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and then being as a viewer,
participating the play

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.455 align:middle line:84%
of theatre which
happening there.

00:40:20.455 --> 00:40:24.045 align:middle line:84%
But it is you, and you
know that you are this.

00:40:24.045 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>At Disneyworld they
had this Kodak ride

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
where you sit in
this seat and you

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
go-- there's this movie
that surrounds you.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you feel like
you're a part of the action.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
get butterflies when

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:44.690 align:middle line:90%
there's a big drop or something.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:49.007 align:middle line:84%
So it was around me
in a form to where

00:40:49.007 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:90%
it was like I was participating.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.888 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.888 --> 00:40:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was participating
in the mind or in thought.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But it just seemed
like a lifetime

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of pain happened in just
a short period of time.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>I had a panoramic
view of my life.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Every feeling, every thought,
every action, every deed

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:90%
The same time.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And as it started
happening, I began

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:23.322 align:middle line:84%
to see how I affected
the person that I

00:41:23.322 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
had the encounter with
or the experience,

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.670 align:middle line:84%
whether it be me personally,
or whether it be someone else.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And then how they were affected.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:35.600 align:middle line:84%
How it was one step removed from
us and how they were affected.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, there is
nothing hidden in your life.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>If you imagine this
panorama of your life

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:84%
as like a still pond, and
each action in your life

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.370 align:middle line:84%
is like a pebble which
you flip into that pond.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:84%
At the point where that
pebble impacts on the surface,

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.745 align:middle line:90%
you see ripples going out.

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But he said that as these
ripples in this panorama

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
impinge on others, then you can
see the secondary effects going

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.300 align:middle line:84%
off from those people
in the form of ripples.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>I see.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think it
illustrates how tied in we

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.160 align:middle line:84%
all are to one
another in this life.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:84%
How profoundly our actions and
our feelings affect others.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, in this life
review we're made aware of that

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:90%
in a very profound way.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And people say, too, that it's
not the events in your life

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that you would necessarily
expect which get reviewed.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not the big
accomplishments, but rather

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.620 align:middle line:90%
the simple acts of kindness.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Often things that you
would even have forgotten.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>You will see the
things that you did out

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.860 align:middle line:84%
of your heart--
helping an old woman,

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.560 align:middle line:84%
picking a kid up,
helping someone.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.980 align:middle line:84%
An action that you take
uncalculated, unthought,

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.100 align:middle line:84%
just out of goodness
of your heart.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.030 align:middle line:84%
These things herald
through the universe.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:84%
Not your great accomplishments,
not what you achieve

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.652 align:middle line:90%
or what you think has value.

00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:05.270 align:middle line:90%
The little things have value.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:09.625 align:middle line:84%
>>And what I'd always thought
was important and nice things I

00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:84%
had done, they didn't
even count for anything.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:17.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the little unknown things
that you do for one another.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And love there is always helping
to give others love and helping

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.820 align:middle line:84%
hand along the way,
and at the same time

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you're benefiting, because
you're receiving also.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>And the question
was "What have

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.520 align:middle line:84%
you done with your
life to show me?"

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm looking around
this panoramic view

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.747 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping that you'll
notice some good things,

00:43:41.747 --> 00:43:43.705 align:middle line:84%
and of course I'm trying
to pick the best thing

00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:46.712 align:middle line:84%
and he won't see some rather
embarrassing things that

00:43:46.712 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:90%
happened to me as a teenager.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well,
I was an Eagle Scout.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Immediately came back,
that glorified you.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Again, asked a second time.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.650 align:middle line:84%
"What have you done
with your life?"

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:84%
This time the emphasis
was on to show me.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But I understood
what he was saying.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.220 align:middle line:84%
He was asking me had I learned
to love my fellow human beings

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the way that he totally
accepted and loved me.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>And when you look
at it, you look at it

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:84%
from a place to review, and to
be critical of yourself, not

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to be judged to be condemned.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.810 align:middle line:90%
There was no condemnation in it.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:21.530 align:middle line:90%
There was none.

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing but,
hey, look at yourself.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Look who you really are.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And look what you've
done, and then

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.230 align:middle line:84%
give it a value in
the Eyes of God.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The death experience gives you
a value of what that love is.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:84%
That you are so deeply
loved, and that you,

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.900 align:middle line:90%
yourself, so deeply love.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You begin to sense a part of
yourself greater and far more

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:49.051 align:middle line:84%
magnificent than you ever
give yourself credit for.

00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Frequently, too,
people tell us

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that this being is also
interested in the knowledge

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that they've acquired
in this life.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.270 align:middle line:84%
If there is a scene in which
one is seeking knowledge

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:84%
by taking a course or attempting
to understand something,

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that this being comments in an
almost offhanded sort of way.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.468 align:middle line:84%
That even after we die, the
process of learning goes on.

00:45:11.468 --> 00:45:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And that what we
learn here we can

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.500 align:middle line:90%
take with us to the next realm.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.820 align:middle line:90%
People say that love, primarily.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And then in a secondary,
almost grace note sort of way,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.290 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to be the
knowledge and the understanding

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.245 align:middle line:90%
we've acquired.

00:45:28.245 --> 00:45:29.411 align:middle line:90%
>>I know what you're saying.

00:45:29.411 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>After a time in this
light, all of these people

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.520 align:middle line:90%
have to pay a return trip back.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting that when

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
they do, after having been
in the presence of this being

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.780 align:middle line:84%
of love and light for
a while, they literally

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.830 align:middle line:90%
don't want to come back.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:02.210 align:middle line:84%
They resist the attempts very
often made to send them back.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>I never wanted to come back.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have traded, and
I would not trade today.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.040 align:middle line:84%
For the few moments that I got
to spend on the other side,

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trade
20 of these lives.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I had to
come back, I came back

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:84%
dragging, kicking
and scratching,

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:16.760 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't want to.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'm told then are
you ready to go back?

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.630 align:middle line:84%
No, I want to go on
to the city of light.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:90%
No, don't you want to go back?

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear my daughter
and look back and see her

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and my husband, they
were saying Vi, don't go.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Come back to us.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Momma, I need you.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Mom, come back.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me again,
are you ready to go?

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I said no, but it seems
that my daughter needs me,

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.940 align:middle line:90%
so I must go back.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>I really had no
reason to go back,

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.584 align:middle line:84%
except that I can
remember my mother.

00:46:45.584 --> 00:46:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I put
her through a lot.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I was a very accident prone kid.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And she used to say, if
you ever die before I do,

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forgive you.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.960 align:middle line:84%
My mother was so adamant about
me not dying before she did.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
first came into my mind.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>We are alive because
of love, and this

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.890 align:middle line:84%
was what brought me back,
which, to be honest,

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:10.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to come back.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:90%
But this love brought me back.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Love of people who
wanted me back.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Other times they say that
they're given a choice.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.850 align:middle line:84%
That they're told
that they can either

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.580 align:middle line:84%
go on with the experience that
they're having then or else

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:27.050 align:middle line:84%
they can return to the life
they have been leading.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>You could stay here
or you can go back.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:38.040 align:middle line:84%
If you stay you're going to
have to go through everything

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:90%
that brought you to this point.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I was seeing the things

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that had bought me to that
point, the things in my life

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:90%
that were painful.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.240 align:middle line:84%
There were other things,
but somehow the things

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that had been painful
were the things

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:90%
that made the biggest impact.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I didn't want
to go through that again.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So there was no way
to escape that if you

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:84%
try to kill yourself
and you succeed, somehow

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
go through everything

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:90%
that was painful in your life.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And then have to
go from the point

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:90%
where you killed yourself also.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:90%
So you're not escaping.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>And people will say to me,
they say, "Well, Dannion,

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:30.980 align:middle line:90%
what about hell?

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, "Well,
they didn't bring it

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and I darn sure didn't, because
maybe they might have checked

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and said, 'Hey, Dannion,
you're on this wrong list.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
be somewhere else."

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.716 align:middle line:84%
>>They also want
to know about hell.

00:48:44.716 --> 00:48:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it a fiery, burny place.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I found to be
hell was separation from God.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.600 align:middle line:90%
This is a total hell.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Darkness, where I was first.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
as somebody told

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:06.440 align:middle line:84%
you, the separation from
light, from love, from God,

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.122 align:middle line:90%
from infinity.

00:49:08.122 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Of course this is hell.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.686 align:middle line:84%
That's why suicide was
condemned by all religious.

00:49:14.686 --> 00:49:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why they are telling
you that you will go to hell.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:84%
It means you will go to nowhere,
and nowhere does not exist.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.495 align:middle line:84%
It means you will go somewhere
on opposite than goodness.

00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Very often they're told
it's not your time to die yet.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got things
left to accomplish,

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.976 align:middle line:90%
so you must go back.

00:49:36.976 --> 00:49:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>This weekend I was in
morgue, and on Monday, I

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.430 align:middle line:84%
was taken from morgue, washed,
and they begin autopsy.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.585 align:middle line:90%


00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It was 11 o'clock in the morning
when they opened my abdomen.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:90%
They took hematoma.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And they began this
T kind autopsy.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And some great power took me
with neck, I think-- that part,

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain
it-- pushed me down.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this movement down,
and then I felt my headache

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.360 align:middle line:90%
and I opened eyes.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And this was coming
back to my body.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>The next thing
that I knew, I was

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.830 align:middle line:84%
floating over my body
in the emergency room

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and they were working on me.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.146 align:middle line:90%
Then they stopped working on me.

00:50:29.146 --> 00:50:31.600 align:middle line:90%
They put a sheet over me.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.100 align:middle line:84%
They filled out a piece of paper
and they rolled me in a room.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was lying in
that room, and I

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
was hovering above
myself watching myself.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Then I heard what would appear
to be an elevator door opened,

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and these two guys
came in and they

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.430 align:middle line:84%
were getting ready
to take me someplace.

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I later found out that that
was probably the morgue.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Then at that exact moment
I was inside a body again.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:90%
It was on fire.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:90%
It was in pain.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I could not move.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.310 align:middle line:90%
So I started blowing the sheet.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:09.280 align:middle line:84%
[BLOW] And they
jerked the sheet off,

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.200 align:middle line:84%
pushed me back into the
emergency room, worked on me

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and stabilized me.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the course over
the next seven days

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.185 align:middle line:90%
I was completely paralyzed.

00:51:17.185 --> 00:51:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>It's so touching to
me that in the closing

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.890 align:middle line:84%
moments of their life, that
so many people come back

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:39.660 align:middle line:84%
reporting that what was most
important to them at this time

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.560 align:middle line:90%
was love.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.530 align:middle line:84%
The question of
how they had loved

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.280 align:middle line:90%
their fellow human beings.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>It had a lot of effects
and change in my life.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It's made me a more
understanding person of others.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I know I don't have the
right to take my life.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to return and
I would love to go back.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Some day I will.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I hopefully can stay
and not have to come back

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and try again.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But I know I cannot take
my life and go there.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:11.372 align:middle line:90%
Things would not work out right.

00:52:11.372 --> 00:52:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'm a better
person about watching

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:17.670 align:middle line:84%
for the needs of others and
not being always selfish.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm still selfish.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.825 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a human.

00:52:20.825 --> 00:52:23.635 align:middle line:84%
But it has changed
my way of thinking.

00:52:23.635 --> 00:52:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>And how to love
other people and how

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to forgive, and to put yourself
in the place of other people

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.160 align:middle line:90%
in order to understand them.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:41.620 align:middle line:84%
That's something that you have
to do in order to love people.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And in order to love yourself.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if you hold grudges
and you-- it hurts you

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.630 align:middle line:90%
and it hurts the other people.

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a barrier to
love, if you can't forgive.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily have to
forget when people hurt you,

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.430 align:middle line:84%
but you have to understand
them and forgive them.

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that is the
most important thing about love

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned, and how
to look at how we're alike,

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.150 align:middle line:90%
rather than how we're different.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the main message which
I brought back that love is

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.030 align:middle line:90%
what cannot be changed.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.140 align:middle line:90%
This is everlasting.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And love is with
life always together.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Love, what keeps
this world alive.

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Love as in eternity.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Love as that basic of humankind.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:45.075 align:middle line:84%
And we are alive
because of love.

00:53:45.075 --> 00:53:51.157 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.157 --> 00:53:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the most important
point about the death

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.930 align:middle line:84%
experience is that
it is orderly.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that small
children, all the way

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to grown people have
similar experiences.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:03.975 align:middle line:84%
And if people could
understand that if they

00:54:03.975 --> 00:54:06.100 align:middle line:84%
would pay more attention
to each other, and to care

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and have faith and
hope in each other,

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.420 align:middle line:84%
we could also begin
to believe and have

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.050 align:middle line:84%
faith and hope in the true
nature of the Love of God.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And not God in a
religious value,

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.035 align:middle line:90%
but God in a spiritual value.

00:54:19.035 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And through love all
things are truly possible.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>And also they tell us
that their fear of death

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.390 align:middle line:90%
is totally gone after this.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:29.066 align:middle line:84%
That they have no more
fear of death whatsoever.

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>I saw life as an infinite
life, infinite light.

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.240 align:middle line:90%
As an everlasting being.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:45.150 align:middle line:84%
We cannot die, because we are
already created for to live

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:46.300 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:51.580 align:middle line:84%
The dimension of spirit
is everlasting life.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:56.037 align:middle line:84%
>>The third thing that I have
learned is that life is final.

00:54:56.037 --> 00:54:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Death is nothing more
or less than a doorway

00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.820 align:middle line:90%
you suddenly walk through.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Death does not exist.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Death is only the part, as
a station, railroad station,

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:12.670 align:middle line:84%
where you come always
to go to another life.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>"I find it very
comforting and encouraging

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.290 align:middle line:84%
to hear from so many people
who have explored life

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.740 align:middle line:84%
beyond physical death
that life goes on.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So I know it's true, if
either of us went tomorrow,

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:27.970 align:middle line:84%
we'd be joined again in what
must seem like an instant.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.980 align:middle line:84%
'Back in a flash,'
as you always say."

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.620 align:middle line:84%
"But whatever
happens, I want you

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.220 align:middle line:84%
to know that I feel very blessed
to have had you as my father

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.370 align:middle line:90%
and I love you very much.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.480 align:middle line:90%
With much love, Peter."

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Know that it'll
be a safe journey.

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:48.815 align:middle line:84%
That you'll be taking
that journey not alone,

00:55:48.815 --> 00:55:50.950 align:middle line:90%
but surrounded by love.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.130 align:middle line:84%
A greater love than
you understand.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to you your
part and place in that journey,

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it be not to come
back, or to be like a few of us

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:03.490 align:middle line:84%
to return, know that it
symbolized the orderly way

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.490 align:middle line:84%
in which God has prepared
life for each of us.

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And in that life,
the orderly passing

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:90%
and movement to another life.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.230 align:middle line:90%
That you do not die.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.260 align:middle line:84%
That the Love of God sees
you through all things,

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.743 align:middle line:84%
and that you will be forever,
just in another place.

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>It was about three weeks later
when we got the phone call.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I was told that he died
with a smile on his face.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And the last words he
said were "the light."
