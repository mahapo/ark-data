- [Voiceover] Legends
throughout the world

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.563 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
have spoken of a race of giants
that once walked the Earth.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:31.965 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The Holy Bible speaks
about the offspring

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:35.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of the sons of God and
the daughters of man.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:40.007 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It is believed by some that
these were the Nephilim,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
theorized to be
gigantic in nature.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Arguments have risen in
the theological community

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.316 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
for centuries, as to
what the Nephilim were.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.119 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Or if they were 
indeed the giants

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
that seem
to be described.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
However, what 
cannot be argued

00:00:56.356 --> 00:01:00.694 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is that Judeo-Christian
doctrines are not the only ones

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:04.031 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to speak of a giant
human species.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:08.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Who were these giants that
once roamed the Earth?

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:24.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
(Middle Eastern music)

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Before the Bible was
even conceived of

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.891 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
there were oral
histories passed down

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from generation to
generation in Mesopotamia,

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:38.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Greece, Rome, Egypt,
as well as America.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Most of these legends speak
of powerful gods and goddesses

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.571 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that were larger than life.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.473 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
History has relegated
these legends

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.809 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to the myth status
and they are not seen

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as actual historical accounts.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.881 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
However, it is noteworthy
that there were many

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.752 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of these legends all over
the world at one point.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.387 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
How did so many
different cultures,

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:02.656 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
who had nothing to
do with each other,

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.993 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
end up with sImilar
stories of giants?

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:08.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And is there evidence of
the existence of giants

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
available today?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The legends of giants in
Mediterranean countries

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.806 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
were probably the most
widely known and discussed.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Beyond the biblical accounts,
such as David and Goliath,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.447 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there are the accounts of the
Babylonian king Gilgamesh.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.282 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
In stone tablets that
have been recovered,

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
there are images carved of
Gilgamesh taking on a lion.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And looking at the scale
of the ancient carvings,

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
it appears this man had
to have been at least

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.764 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
12 to 15 feet tall,
taking into consideration

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:47.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the size of the lion he is
portrayed to have slain.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:55.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Gilgamesh lived sometime
between 2800 and 2500 B.C.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:58.145 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He is the main character
in the "Epic of Gilgamesh",

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
a Mesopotamian poem
that is considered

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.351 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the first great
work of literature.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In the epic,
Gilgamesh is a demigod

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:09.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of super human strength,
who built the city walls

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:14.661 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of Uruk to defend his people
and survive the great deluge.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.597 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
According to the
Sumerian king list,

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:22.169 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Gilgamesh ruled his
city for 126 years.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.172 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Fragments of an epic
text found in Me-Turan,

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:29.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the modern Tell Haddad,
relate that at end of his life

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Gilgamesh was buried
under the riverbed.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.549 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It is generally
accepted that Gilgamesh

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
was a historical figure, since
inscriptions have been found

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.022 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
which confirm the
historical existence

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.758 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
of other figures
associated with him,

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:47.727 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
such as the Aga of Kish.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
If Gilgamesh was
a historical king,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.001 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
he probably reigned in
about the 26th century B.C.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Where did Gilgamesh come from?

00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In the Qumran Scroll, known
as the Book of Giants,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.876 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the names of
Gilgamesh and Humbaba

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:06.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
appear as two of the
antediluvian giants.

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:08.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Could Gilgamesh have
come from Atlantis

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:13.053 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or be a direct descendant
of antediluvian kings?

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:21.194 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
(Native American flute music)

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:29.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If giants existed in the
past, where is the evidence?

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You may be surprised
to find that it's been

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and is being discovered
all over the world.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Skeletal remains of giants
have been discovered

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:42.249 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
throughout American history
and even further back.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
According to Native American
Paiute oral history,

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:50.157 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the Si-Te-Cah are a legendary
tribe whose mummified remains

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:53.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
were allegedly discovered
under four feet of guano

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
by guano miners in
what is now known

00:04:56.263 --> 00:05:01.134 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
as Lovelock Cave in
Lovelock, Nevada.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Several of the fiber sandals
found in Lovelock Cave

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:05.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
were remarkably large.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And one reported at
over 15 inches in length

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was said to be on display at
the Nevada Historical Society's

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
museum in Reno in 1952.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Paiute tradition asserts
that the Si-Te-Cah people

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:24.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
practiced cannibalism,
and this may have had

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
some basis in fact.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.863 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
During the 1924
excavation of the cave,

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.899 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a series of three human
bones were found near

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the surface towards
the mouth of the cave.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:38.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
These had been split
to extract the marrow,

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as animal bones were split and
probably indicate cannibalism

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
during a famine.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
As reported in the "Nevada
Review Miner" newspaper

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:52.786 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
on June 19th, 1931, in
February and June of 1931

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
two very large
skeletons were found

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:59.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the Humboldt dry
lakebed near Lovelock.

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
One skeleton was 8.5 feet
tall and was later described

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
as being wrapped in
a gum-covered fabric

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
not unlike Egyptian mummies.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.938 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
The other was almost 10 feet.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It was said that all
the tribes of the area

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
stood together
against these giants

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and chased them into a cave.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:22.015 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The giants refused to leave
the safety of the cave,

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:24.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so the Paiutes, along
with other tribes,

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
set the cave on fire.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.155 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The cave then collapsed
during an earthquake

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:31.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
sealing the entrance shut.

00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:34.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When the area was mined
for fertilizing materials,

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:38.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there were several fossils
discovered in the early 1920s.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Along with those fossils
were the well preserved

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:45.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
human-like skeletons,
one male and one female.

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:47.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The female was
over six feet tall

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.011 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and the male was
over eight feet tall.

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:53.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Along with the discovery
of the skeletons,

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.448 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
there were many other
artifacts found,

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
including a circular
calendar that had the number

00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:02.889 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of days and weeks of
a year etched into it.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.059 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In 1931, two more
skeletons were discovered

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.194 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in Lockport, Nevada
that measured

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:11.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
from eight to ten feet tall.

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:23.376 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
During the past few
years, a huge controversy

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:26.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
has emerged accusing
the Smithsonian

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and a host of skeptics
and archeologists

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of covering up the discovery
of hundreds of giant skeletons

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
from Native American
Indian mounds.

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:38.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Jim Ferreira is one of
the key people who began

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:41.428 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
uncovering hundreds
of newspaper accounts

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.296 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of giant skeletons.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:47.967 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Today, Ferreira has pulled
together about 1,500 accounts

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.438 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from newspapers and books
published in the 1800s

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:54.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
and early 1900s.

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:57.444 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
One intriguing set of
giant skeleton reports

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:58.812 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
he found factual,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.981 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
was the Arkansas
Chickasawba Mound reports

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.618 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
of many large skeletons
found at the site.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:09.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Many skeletons ranging from
eight to nine feet in length

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
had been found there.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
As late as 1976, a
seven foot tall skeleton

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
was found at the site.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
For the Smithsonian to
have found skeletons

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that were seven feet tall by
chance alone is improbable.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The height of many of
the individuals entombed

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.775 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in ancient American
mounds was far taller

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
than the general populous.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.014 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Far beyond what could
explained by simple chance.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:40.353 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Why would the Smithsonian
cover up such a find?

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Skeptics have related that
the disorder of gigantism

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.759 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
probably was the
cause of many report.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:49.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But they actually cite no
evidence for this assertion.

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:54.234 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is a weak attempt to explain
away and dismiss the issue.

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Gigantism is exceedingly rare,

00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:01.674 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so rare there is no actual
evidential statistics for it.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:05.512 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
America has less than 100
cases of gigantism recorded

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:07.514 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
in its history.

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:10.717 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In fact, the overwhelming
vast majority

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.852 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of tall people today,

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:15.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
whose reaching or
approaching seven feet,

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
do not have the
disorder of gigantism.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:21.428 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The actual percentage
of modern humans

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:26.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
who reach seven feet
in height is 0.00007%.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.537 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In the ancient world of
America's mound builders,

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:34.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the percentage of the population
that reached seven feet

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:37.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in height would have
been much lower.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Skeptics claim that
freezing and thawing

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:44.117 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
makes skeletons so big they
might look like a giant.

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:47.554 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It was found to be completely
wrong and baseless.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Modern paleopathology
texts and sources

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
relate that buried bones
that freeze can shatter

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and most buried bones
actually lose mass,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.566 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
they get smaller.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:02.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There are also a host of
Native American legends

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:05.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that were reported to
ethnologists detailing

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a race of giants who
invaded the regions

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
where mounds were found.

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:12.812 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
These giants became the leaders
and priests of the tribes.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Over time these ruling people,
chosen through heredity,

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:21.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
became corrupted and
were exterminated.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.591 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You may be surprised at the
number of giant skeletons

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:27.794 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that have been uncovered
throughout modern history.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.797 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There is a number of
discoveries that didn't make it

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:34.133 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to mainstream
historical knowledge.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.903 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Large bones in stone
graves in Williamson County

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:40.907 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and White County, Tennessee,
were discovered in the 1800s.

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:46.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The average stature of these
giants was seven feet tall.

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:48.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Giant skeletons were
found in the mid-1800s

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:52.252 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in New York state, near
Rutland and Rodman.

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In 1833, soldiers digging at
Lompock Rancho, California

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
discovered a male
skeleton 12 feet tall.

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:03.296 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The skeleton was
surrounded by caved shells,

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
stone axes and other artifacts.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The skeleton had double rows
of upper and lower teeth.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Unfortunately this body
was secretly buried

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.877 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
because the local Indians
became upset about the remains.

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A giant skull and vertebrae
were found in Wisconsin

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and Kansas City as well.

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:25.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
A giant found off
the California coast

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
on Santa Rosa
Island in the 1800s,

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:31.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was distinguished by
its double row of teeth,

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:34.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
common among giant
skeleton finds.

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:37.664 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A nine foot, eight inch
skeleton was excavated

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:42.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from a mound near
Brewersville, Indiana in 1879.

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:44.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Skeletons said to be
of enormous dimensions

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:47.674 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
were found in mounds
near Zanesville, Ohio

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:51.277 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and Warren, Minnesota
in the 1800s.

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:54.681 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In Clearwater, Minnesota,
the skeletons of seven giants

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.516 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
were found in mounds.

00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:00.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
These had receding foreheads
and complete double dentition,

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:02.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
two rows of teeth.

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:05.258 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
At La Crescent, Minnesota
mounds were found

00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:06.793 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to contain giant bones.

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Five miles north in
Dreshbach, the bones of people

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
over eight feet tall were found.

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:42.261 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In 1888, seven skeletons
ranging from seven to eight

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
feet tall were discovered.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Though they may seem like a lot,

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:48.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
near Toledo, Ohio, 20
skeletons were discovered

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:52.071 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with jaws and teeth
twice as large as those

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of present day people.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The account also noted
that odd hieroglyphics

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:58.745 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
were found with the bodies.

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The aforementioned miners in
Lovelock Cave, California,

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:05.752 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
discovered a very tall,
red haired mummy in 1911.

00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:08.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A local native has a
dress made from the hair

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:11.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of one of the giants
from this area.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:16.262 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In 1931, skeletons from eight
and half to ten feet long

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:20.767 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
were found in the Humbolt
lake bed in California.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:24.437 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And in 1932, Ellis
Wright found human tracks

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:28.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in the gypsum rock at
White Sands, New Mexico.

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
His discovery was later
backed up by Fred Arthur,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
supervisor of the
Lincoln National Park

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.916 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and others who reported
that each footprint

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:42.789 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
was 22 inches long and from
eight to 10 inches wide.

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:45.458 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They were certain the
prints were human in origin

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.761 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
due to the outline of the
perfect prints coupled

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
with a readily apparent instep.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:55.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
During World War II,
author Ivan T. Sanderson

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.837 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
tells of how his
crew was bulldozing

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
through sedimentary rock
when it stumbled across

00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
what appeared to be a graveyard.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.681 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In it were crania that
measured from 22 to 24 inches

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from base to crown, nearly
three times as large

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
as an adult human skull.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.589 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Had the creatures to whom
these skulls belonged

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.324 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
been properly proportioned,

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
they undoubtedly would have been

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
at least 12 feet tall or taller.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:28.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
In 1947, a local
newspaper reported

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:31.537 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the discovery of nine
foot tall skeletons

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
by amateur archeologists
working in Death Valley.

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.677 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The archeologists
involved also claimed

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:39.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to have found what
appeared to be the bones

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:44.851 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of tigers and dinosaurs
with the human remains.

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the Catalina
Islands off California

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.856 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
are the home of
dwarf mammoth bones

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:53.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that were once roasted
in ancient pit fires.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:56.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
These were roasted and eaten
by human-like creatures

00:14:56.562 --> 00:15:00.867 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
who were giants with
double rows of teeth.

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:21.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
One fact that
continues to surface

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:25.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the discovery of giants
is the reports of skulls

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.895 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
having more than
one row of teeth.

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.264 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
According to a study
on molecular genetics

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
of supernumerary
tooth formation,

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:37.303 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the cause of extra rows
of teeth is genetic.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:39.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Despite advances
in the knowledge

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:42.909 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of tooth morphogenesis
and differentiation

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:45.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
relatively little is known
about the molecular mechanisms

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:49.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
underlying supernumerary
tooth formation.

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.551 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
A small number of
supernumerary teeth

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:54.921 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
may be a common
developmental dental anomaly.

00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:57.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
While multiple supernumerary
teeth usually have

00:15:57.924 --> 00:16:00.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a genetic component and
they are sometimes thought

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:05.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to represent a partial
third dentition in humans.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Mice, which are commonly
used for studying

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:11.938 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
tooth development, only
exhibit one dentition,

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with very few mouse
models exhibiting

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.944 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
supernumerary teeth
similar to those in humans.

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:22.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Activation of APC or forced
activation of WNT canenin signal

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:25.685 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
results in multiple
supernumerary tooth formation

00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
in both humans and in mice,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but the key genes in these
pathways are not very clear.

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Analysis of other model systems

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.362 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
with continuous
tooth replacement

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.431 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
or secondary tooth formation,

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:41.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
such as fish, snake,
lizard, and ferret,

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is providing insights into the

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.972 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
molecular and
cellular mechanisms

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:48.641 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
underlying successional
tooth development,

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:49.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and should assist in the studies

00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:53.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
on supernumerary tooth
formation in humans.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But scientists say
this information,

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
together with the advances
in stem cell biology

00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:00.519 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and tissue engineering,
will pave ways

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for the tooth regeneration
and tooth bioengineering.

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:08.427 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Though having two rows
of teeth is not uncommon,

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:11.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the specific genetics of
giants would probably be

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:17.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a specific trait to this
line of human development.

00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:21.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Along with the reports
of double rows of teeth,

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:26.679 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
extra digits in the hands and
feet are sometimes reported.

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:28.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Along the Illinois
River in a cave,

00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:32.018 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a priest claimed he
found prints in rock.

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:35.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The larger representation of
the human foot was 14 inches

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and had six toes
instead of five.

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Morse's "Universal Geography,"
according to the priest,

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.664 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
gives this account
of a number of tracks

00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:47.233 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
or foot impressions
found in rocks

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the mountains of Tennessee.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:51.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Along these were
a number of tracks

00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:55.408 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
representing human
feet and they uniformly

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
had six toes on each foot.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:04.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
(mystical music)

00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:22.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Scientists are stubbornly silent
about lost races of giants,

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:24.904 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
such as those found
in burial mounds

00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:28.808 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
near Lake Delavan,
Wisconsin in May of 1912.

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:31.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The dig site at Lake
Delavan was overseen

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
by Beloit College and
it included more than

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.484 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
200 effigy mounds that
proved to be classic examples

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:41.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of 8th century Woodland culture.

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:43.556 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But the enormous
size of the skeletons

00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:46.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and elongated skulls
found in May of 1912

00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:50.629 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
did not fit very neatly
into anyone's concept

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.832 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
of a textbook standard.

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.767 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
They were enormous.

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:57.103 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They were not
average human beings.

00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:00.373 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
First reported on the
4th of May 1912 issue

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:01.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of the "New York Times,"

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the 18 skeletons found
by the Peterson brothers

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
on Lake Lawn Farm in
southwest Wisconsin

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.084 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
exhibited several strange
and freakish features.

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.654 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Their heights ranged
from 7.6 feet and 10 feet

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:18.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and their skulls,
presumably those of men,

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:20.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
were much larger than
the heads of any race

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
which inhabit America today.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:25.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They tend to have a
double row of teeth,

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
six fingers, six
toes and like humans

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
came in different races.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:33.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The teeth in the front of
the jaw were regular molars.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:36.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Heads usually found were
elongated and believed

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:40.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
due to a longer than
normal life span.

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:43.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
The Lake Delavan
find of May 1912

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:45.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
was only one of dozens
of several finds

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.154 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that were reported
in local newspapers

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
from 1851 forward
to the present day.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It was not even the first
set of giant skeletons found

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
in Wisconsin.

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:58.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
On the 10th of August of 1891,

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:00.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the "New York Times"
reported that scientists

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
from the Smithsonian
Institute had discovered

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:07.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
several large pyramidal
monuments on Lake Mills,

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:09.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
near Madison, Wisconsin.

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:11.243 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Madison was, in ancient days,

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:16.048 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the center of a teeming
population of over 200,000.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The excavators found
an elaborate system

00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:23.689 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of a defensive works, which
they named Fort Aztalan.

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The "New York Times" says,

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the celebrated mounds
of Ohio and Indiana

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.201 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
can bear no comparison,
either in size, design

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:38.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or the skill displayed
in their construction

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:41.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with these gigantic and
mysterious monuments of earth,

00:20:41.207 --> 00:20:43.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
erected we know not by whom,

00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and for what purpose
we can only conjecture.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.216 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
On the 20th of December 1897,

00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:52.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the Times followed
up with a report

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
on three large burial mounds

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:57.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that had been discovered
in Maple Creek, Wisconsin.

00:20:57.623 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
One had recently been opened.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:09.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In it was found the skeleton
of a man of gigantic size.

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:13.139 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The bones measured from
head to foot over nine feet

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:15.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and were in a fair
state of preservation.

00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:18.978 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The skull was as large
as a half bushel measure.

00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:21.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Some finely tempered
rods of copper

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:25.317 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and other relics were
lying near the bones.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Giant skulls and skeletons
of a race of giants

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
have been found on
a very regular basis

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
throughout the midwestern
states for more than 100 years.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Giants have been found
in Minnesota, Iowa,

00:21:57.917 --> 00:22:01.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Illinois, Ohio,
Kentucky and New York.

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And their burial sites are
similar to the well-known mounds

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the Mound Builder people.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:10.296 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The spectrum of
Mound Builder history

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:13.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
spans a period of
more than 5,000 years.

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:17.403 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A period greater than the
history of ancient Egypt

00:22:17.403 --> 00:22:19.972 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and all of its dynasties.

00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:23.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Most scientists believe
that we have an adequate

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:26.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
historical understanding
of the peoples

00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:28.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who lived in North America
during this period.

00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:31.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
However, the long record
of anomalous finds

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:36.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
like those at Lake
Delavan suggest otherwise.

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:40.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The January 13th, 
1870 edition

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:43.329 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the "Wisconsin Decatur
Republican" reported

00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:46.031 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that two giant well
preserved skeletons

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
of an 
unknown race

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
were discovered 
near Potosi, Wisconsin

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
by workers digging the
foundation of a saw mill

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:55.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
near the bank of the
Mississippi River.

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
One skeleton measured
seven and a half feet,

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.346 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
the other eight feet.

00:23:00.346 --> 00:23:03.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The skulls of each had
prominent cheek bones

00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:05.551 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and double rows of teeth.

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
A large collection of arrowheads

00:23:07.453 --> 00:23:12.558 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and strange toys were found
buried near the remains.

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:16.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
While a normal size skeleton
of a supposed Mound Builder

00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:18.664 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is on display at the
site of several large

00:23:18.664 --> 00:23:21.166 align:middle line:74% position:48% size:48%
pyramidal monuments
near Madison,

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:23.369 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
called Aztalan 
State Park.

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:26.905 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The goliath remains
of Wisconsin's giants

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:29.275 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
have vanished along
with the hundreds

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:32.611 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of other discoveries
throughout the Midwest.

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
Why?

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.683 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Is there some conspiracy to
hide these giant artifacts

00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:39.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
from the public?

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:42.888 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Giant skeleton
finds have not made

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:46.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the local or national
news much since the 1950s,

00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:47.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
for the most part.

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:50.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It seems the opinion
is that they fear

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:54.433 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that people would
question evolution.

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:59.405 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
(Native American music)

00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:20.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
During the time of
these discoveries,

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:22.428 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the Smithsonian was
taking possession

00:24:22.428 --> 00:24:25.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of nearly every
giant skeleton found

00:24:25.064 --> 00:24:27.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
throughout the entire country,

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:30.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
including the largest
discovery of skeletons found

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.005 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
in the Great Mound in Ohio.

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.441 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
What the intent of
the institution was

00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:38.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for the giant skeletons
has never been discovered.

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
But several investigators today,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.883 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
believe the Smithsonian was
founded at least in part,

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:48.253 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to take the skeletons
and hide or destroy them,

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:52.791 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
dumping some by the barge
full in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:55.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Why one might ask?

00:24:55.127 --> 00:24:58.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Some believe it was to hide
the true history of the Earth,

00:24:58.297 --> 00:25:00.466 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
as giant skeletons
were being discovered

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:03.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
throughout the world
in the late 1800s.

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And some believe it was

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to backup Darwin's
theory of evolution.

00:25:07.473 --> 00:25:11.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If such entities lived on
Earth, thousands of years ago,

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
then Darwin's theory
would be automatically

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:16.215 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
called into question.

00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:18.884 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Never included in
history books is the fact

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:22.488 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that every Native
American tribe in America

00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:26.492 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
tells the same tale of having
to fight and kill the giants,

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:28.193 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
because they were maneaters

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:31.263 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and were decimating
the native tribes.

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Perhaps because the
giants were so large,

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the tribes mounded
dirt to bury them

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
instead of digging graves,

00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which would explain the
hundreds if not thousands

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of mound burial sites
throughout America.

00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:47.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Giant skeletal remains
have been found

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:50.416 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
from Brooklyn, New York
to the Channel Islands

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:52.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
off the coast of California.

00:25:52.518 --> 00:25:54.920 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Most of the remains
are mass burials

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
with signs of violent death,

00:25:57.222 --> 00:26:00.526 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as if a huge battle had
been fought then won,

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:03.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the massacred buried
deep in the mounds

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
to contain them.

00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:09.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Most if not all of
American history textbooks

00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
never mention Cahokia, America's
greatest city for its time.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.378 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A very large Indian trading
city, 3.5 miles in size

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:22.614 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on the site of where
St. Louis now stands.

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:26.118 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was built about the same
time of the Mayan culture

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:31.423 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and was surrounded by 120
pyramids and farmland.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
At its zenith, the city
had 15,000 inhabitants,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which compared to Paris
population wise at the time.

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:42.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The city existed at the same
time of the Mound Builders

00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:45.571 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and it is surmised
that they were the ones

00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:47.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
who built Cahokia.

00:26:47.573 --> 00:26:52.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But the mystery remains,
who were the Mound Builders?

00:26:52.244 --> 00:26:56.582 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In 1170, a mysterious
fire destroyed the city

00:26:56.582 --> 00:26:57.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
when it was rebuilt.

00:26:57.583 --> 00:27:00.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Defense walls were
built and new buildings,

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
which were all
smaller and fortified.

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:05.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The city was never
populated or as powerful

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
following that fire.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.596 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
No one knows how
the fire started,

00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:13.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but the homes that burned
were built with thatched roofs

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:16.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and were easily destroyed.

00:27:16.502 --> 00:27:18.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Archaeologists have
surmised that rebels

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:22.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
burned the town and
instituted a sun imagery

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:24.076 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that was used thereafter.

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:26.578 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But if you put the pieces
of this puzzle together,

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:31.617 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you might come up with an
entirely different history.

00:27:31.617 --> 00:27:34.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Considering the tales of
modern Native Americans,

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:37.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
whose cultures related
stories of the giants,

00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:40.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you can imagine that
they were the ones

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:44.129 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
who burned Cahokia to destroy
the giants within the city.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:47.366 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
When they rebuilt, the
victorious Native Americans

00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:50.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
put up defenses and
built much smaller homes

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:52.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to live in because
they were not giants,

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
like their predecessors.

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:57.643 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The homes they built were
more regulated in size

00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:00.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and did not reflect
the wealth and stature

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that the previous larger
homes of the giants displayed.

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
David Cusick, a Tuscororan
Indian, wrote in 1825

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:36.348 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
about a giant tribe
called Ronnongwetowanca

00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:37.716 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
in the Ohio Valley.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.686 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In his account, he wrote
that other smaller tribes

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:43.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
grew tired of the
giants attacking them.

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:46.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So with a force of 800
warriors they killed

00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:49.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
all the Ronnongwetowanca people.

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:52.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
After that, there were
no more giants anywhere.

00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:55.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Cusick wrote that this
happened 2500 years

00:28:55.701 --> 00:29:01.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
before Columbus discovered
America, about 1000 B.C.

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.709 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The thousand giants
who were massacred

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:06.712 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
were laid together in heaps
and covered with dirt,

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:09.047 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which again could explain
the mound building

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.717 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
prevalent in the Ohio Valley.

00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
One amazing fact withheld
from history books

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.723 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is that virtually
every explorer who came

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:21.259 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to the New World
encountered giants.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:25.731 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Amerigo Vespucci,
Magellan, Coronado, De Soto

00:29:25.731 --> 00:29:30.736 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and Sir Francis Drake all
claimed giant encounters.

00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:33.739 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Historically supported by
these eyewitness accounts

00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:36.742 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of some of the world's
most esteemed explorers

00:29:36.742 --> 00:29:40.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the time, these stories
were also chronicled

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:44.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
by the Spanish and other
lesser known explorers.

00:29:47.753 --> 00:29:50.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Stories of giants
that occupied Europe

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
comes from the Middle
Ages and involves

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a surprising figure,
St. Christopher.

00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:58.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
While modern stories
of St. Christopher

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.766 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
simply make him out
as an ordinary man,

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:03.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or perhaps a
somewhat homely man,

00:30:03.402 --> 00:30:07.773 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
those who actually saw him 
had a different story.

00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:10.475 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
According to his
peers, he was a giant

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:11.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
belonging 
to a tribe

00:30:11.777 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of dog-headed,
cannibalistic giants.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Jacobus de Voragine
in "The Golden Legend"

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:20.786 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
wrote of St. Christopher,
he was of gigantic stature,

00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
had a terrifying mien,
and was 12 coudees tall.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
A coudee is an ancient
measurement equal to

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:32.197 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or larger than the English
linear measurement of a foot.

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
According to his
ancient account,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
St. Christopher stood
from 12 to 18 feet tall.

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:41.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A fact that had been
hidden in or even erased

00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:43.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
from church history.

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:01.793 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In humans, gigantism is
usually caused by a tumor

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.829 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
on the pituitary
gland of the brain.

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:06.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It causes growth of the
hands, face and feet.

00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:10.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In some cases, the condition
can be passed on genetically

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:12.838 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
through a mutated gene.

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:15.841 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Many of those who have been
identified with gigantism

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:18.009 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
have suffered from
multiple health issues,

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:21.847 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
involving their circulatory
or skeletal system.

00:31:21.847 --> 00:31:25.317 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Hypersecretion of growth
hormones causes gigantism

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:27.219 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in children and adults.

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:30.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Reports of gigantism
exist throughout history

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:33.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with some nations and
tribes taller than others.

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:35.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The giants of Crete are listed

00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:38.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in various historical
sources, beginning with Titan,

00:31:38.864 --> 00:31:42.534 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a greek mythological giant,
and including Gigantus,

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:45.804 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
after whom giants and
gigantism are named.

00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:48.039 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Rhodes is another
island where giants

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
were said to have lived.

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
With the Colossus of
Rhodes, a giant statue

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.614 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of a giant patron god Helios.

00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:57.883 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Golaiath, a giant
mentioned in the Bible,

00:31:57.883 --> 00:32:00.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was a Philistine warrior
who was slain by David

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:04.589 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in a battle between the
Israelites and Philistines.

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:07.626 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A member of Goliath's
family is also recorded

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:09.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
as having six
fingers on each hand

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:12.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and six toes on each feet.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.903 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The Nephilim, who are
generally accepted to be giant,

00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:20.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
were the offspring
of the sons of God

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.375 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and the daughters of
men before the deluge

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
according to "Genesis."

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The name is also used
in reference to giants

00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:30.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
who inhabited Canaan at the
time of the Israelite conquest

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:33.251 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of Canaan according
to "Numbers."

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:37.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A similar biblical Hebrew word
with different vowel sounds

00:32:37.022 --> 00:32:41.927 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is used in "Ezekiel" to refer
to dead Philistine warriors.

00:32:41.927 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Cotton Mather believed
that fossilized leg bones

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.967 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and teeth discovered near
Albany, New York in 1705

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.336 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
were the remains of
Nephilim who perished

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:52.971 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in a great flood.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:57.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
However, paleontologists claim
these are mastodon remains.

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:06.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(mysterious music)

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.659 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Is it possible that
ancient monuments

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:19.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
found throughout the world
were actually built by giants?

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:24.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Legend tells that Stonehenge
may have such origins.

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:26.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
According to Geoffrey
of Monmouth,

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:27.839 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
the rocks 
of Stonehenge

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were healing rocks, called
the "Giant's Dance",

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:34.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which giants had brought
from Africa to Ireland

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:35.981 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
for their healing properties.

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:38.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The 5th century king
Aurelius Ambrosius

00:33:38.984 --> 00:33:42.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
wished to erect a memorial
to 3,000 nobles slain

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:46.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in battle against the Saxons
and buried at Salisbury,

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and at Merlin's advice
chose Stonehenge.

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:52.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The king sent Merlin,
Uther Pendragon

00:33:52.998 --> 00:33:56.968 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and 15,000 knights to
remove it from Ireland,

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:59.337 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which it had been constructed
on Mount Killaraus

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:01.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
by the giants.

00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:04.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They slew 7,000 Irish,
but as the knights tried

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:08.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to move the rocks with ropes
and force, they failed.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Then Merlin, using
gear and skill,

00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:16.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
easily dismantled the stones
and sent them over to Britain,

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:18.823 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
where Stonehenge was dedicated.

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:21.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It is said that these
kings were buried inside

00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:25.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the "Giants' Rings
of Stonehenge."

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:31.036 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
America also has a Stonehenge
dating back over 2,000 years.

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:35.006 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
America's Stonehenge, sometimes
referred to as Mystery Hill,

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:37.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is an archaeological
site consisting

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:40.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of a number of large
rocks and stone structures

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:42.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
scattered around
roughly 30 acres

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:45.183 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
within the town of
Salem, New Hampshire

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:47.852 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
in the northeast United States.

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:50.922 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Carbon dating of
charcoal pits at the site

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:56.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
provided dates from
2,000 B.C. to 173 B.C.,

00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:59.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
when the area was
populated by ancestors

00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:01.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of current Native Americans.

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:03.868 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
In archaeological chronology,

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:07.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
this places indigenous use
of the site either into

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:11.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the Late Archaic or the
Early Woodland time periods.

00:35:11.076 --> 00:35:17.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It would have been in use
during the time of the giants.

00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:19.784 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Bones and monuments are
not the only evidence

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:22.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
suggesting the
existence of giants,

00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:27.092 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
huge footprints have
also been discovered,

00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:30.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In 1897, the "Los
Angeles Herald" revealed

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:33.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that laborers had discovered
a fossil shoe print

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
in solid rock.

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The imprint was that of a
shoe with high narrow heel

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and a broad flat sole.

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:43.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It was so clear in
the fine grain shale

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in which it was found,
that it looked as though

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the owner had unwittingly
put his foot right

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:51.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in the soft mud a
day or two before.

00:35:51.783 --> 00:35:54.452 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Sandal or moccasin prints
have also been seen

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:58.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in gypsum of the White
Sands in New Mexico.

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:02.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Ellis Wright, in 1932,
found tracks of human form

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:06.965 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
as large as 22 inches long.

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:10.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The White Sands were laid
down as an ancient inlet sea

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.238 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
gradually dried up around
the time of the demise

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:16.041 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
of the dinosaurs.

00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:18.977 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The "American Anthropologist"
published an article

00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:22.914 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
in February 1896,
of a large stone

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
bearing the perfect
imprint of a human foot,

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.887 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
14.5 inches long.

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:30.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It was shown to member's

00:36:30.155 --> 00:36:33.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the Ohio State Academy
of Science in 1896.

00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:36.895 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The stone slab had been
dug from the ground

00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:40.698 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in a hill four miles north of
Parkersburg, West Virginia,

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:43.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
some 20 years earlier.

00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:46.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
In 1938, Dr. Wilbur Burroughs,

00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
head of the geology department
at Berea College, Kentucky,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
announced that he had discovered
10 humanoid footprints

00:36:53.178 --> 00:36:55.713 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in carboniferous
sandstone on a farm

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
belonging to Mr. O.
Finnell in the hills in the

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
southern part of
Rockcastle County.

00:37:00.919 --> 00:37:03.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The prints were nine
and a half inches long

00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and six inches wide.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.726 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The length between
footprints was 18 inches.

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
No marks of four feet
or a tail were found.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.034 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Infrared photography revealed
that there were no signs

00:37:16.034 --> 00:37:18.703 align:middle line:74% position:48% size:48%
of carving or
artificial markings

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.605 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
in or around 
the prints.

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.941 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
A microscopic count
of sand grains

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
indicated that the
material within the prints

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.513 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
had been impacted and
created as the result

00:37:28.513 --> 00:37:30.882 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of force pressing
down on the firmament

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:33.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
while it was soft.

00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:35.987 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
These facts show that
the prints were made

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.224 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
by the natural result of
pressure from the human foot,

00:37:39.224 --> 00:37:44.229 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and in no way could have
been duplicated by carving.

00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:47.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The rock in which the
prints were discovered

00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:52.804 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
was estimated to be
250 million years old.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In recent years, the prints
have been destroyed by vandals.

00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:11.122 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Giant tracks, seemingly
made by a human being,

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:14.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
were found by a government
tracker in the Alkali Flats area

00:38:14.259 --> 00:38:18.263 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the great White Sands,
New Mexico in 1931.

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:21.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A year later, a party of four,
including O. Fred Arthur,

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
supervisor of Lincoln
National Forest,

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:26.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
set out to
investigate the tracks

00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:29.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
with the government trapper
Ellis Wright as their guide.

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:33.278 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They found 13 imprints
crossing a relic desert basin

00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:37.115 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the eastern most foothills
of the San Andreas Mountains.

00:38:37.115 --> 00:38:39.284 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Despite the great
size of the tracks,

00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:41.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the investigators were
convinced they were human,

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:44.522 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for the prints were perfect
and even the insteps

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:46.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
were plainly marked.

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:50.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Oval shaped, the prints
are 16 to 22 inches long

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and eight to 12 inches wide,

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with a distance between
strides of about five feet

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.871 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and a separation in
width of two feet.

00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:03.808 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In 1882, huge footprints,
strongly resembling

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:06.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
those of a human wearing
shoes, were found

00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:09.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in a layer of sandstone in
the yard of the state prison

00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:13.885 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
near Carson City, Nevada
during digging operations.

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:17.622 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The prints were between
18 and 20 inches long,

00:39:17.622 --> 00:39:20.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and approximately
eight inches wide.

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:23.795 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The stride was about three
feet and the distance between

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:25.997 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the left and right
tracks, the straddle,

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:29.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
was about 19 inches.

00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:31.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Since the size of the prints
and the age of the rock

00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.338 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
at the layer they
were discovered,

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:36.574 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
two to three million
years old, argued against

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:39.911 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
a human or even a
humanoid origin.

00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.814 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The prints were ascribed to
a more acceptable origin,

00:39:42.814 --> 00:39:45.883 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the tracks of a
giant ground sloth.

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:48.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's thought that these
animals could stand upright,

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:52.924 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but only by using their
tails for additional support.

00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:56.227 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
However, no tail track
was found at this site.

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It was also suggested
that perhaps the animal

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was walkIng on four feet
and that its rear legs

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:06.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
were landing exactly in the
tracks left by its front feet.

00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:09.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Thereby creating the
impression of a biped.

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:12.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But this fails to
account for the fact

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:16.948 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that the tracks show no toe
marks and appear to be sandals.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
What may well be the
oldest fossil footprint

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:52.016 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
ever discovered,
was found in 1968

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
by William J. Meister, an
amateur fossil collector.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
If the print is what
is appears to be,

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:01.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the impression of a sandaled
shoe crushing a trilobite,

00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:03.328 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
it would have had
to have been made

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:06.831 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
300 to 600 million years ago,

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:09.567 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and would be sufficient
to either overturn

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
all conventionally
accepted ideas

00:41:11.736 --> 00:41:14.405 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of human and
geological evolution,

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
or to prove that a
shoe wearing biped

00:41:16.441 --> 00:41:21.045 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from another world had
once visited this planet.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.981 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Meister made his
potentially disturbing find

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
during a rock and fossil
hunting trip to Antelope Spring,

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.455 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
43 miles west of Delta, Utah.

00:41:30.455 --> 00:41:34.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
His party had already discovered
several fossil trilobites

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:37.161 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
when Meister split open
a rock with his hammer

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.430 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and made the outrageous find.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:43.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The rock fell open like a
book revealing on one side

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:45.870 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the footprint of a
human with trilobites

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
right in the footprint itself.

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:50.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The other half of
the slab of the rock

00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:54.312 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
showed an almost perfect mold
of the footprint in fossils.

00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:58.182 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Amazingly, the human
was wearing a sandal.

00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:01.386 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Trilobites are small
marine invertebrates,

00:42:01.386 --> 00:42:04.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the relatives of today's
shrimp and crabs,

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:07.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that flourished for
over 320 million years

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:12.163 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
before becoming extinct
280 million years ago.

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:38.656 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If giant footprints are
not enough to convince

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:40.458 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
even the most hardened skeptic,

00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:43.494 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
then giant tools and
artifacts might not budge

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.763 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
their restricted
perceptions either.

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:50.368 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
However, consider
these, in June 1936

00:42:50.368 --> 00:42:53.237 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Max Hahn and his wife
Emma were on a walk

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:56.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
when they noticed a rock with
wood protruding from its core.

00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.343 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They took the rock home
and later cracked it open

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.279 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
with a hammer and chisel.

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:05.416 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What they found within seemed
to be an ancient hammer.

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:07.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A team of archaeologists
checked it

00:43:07.552 --> 00:43:10.054 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and determined the rock
encasing the hammer

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:14.192 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
was dated back more
than 400 million years.

00:43:14.192 --> 00:43:16.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The hammer itself
turned out to be be more

00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:18.696 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
than 500 million years old,

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:21.466 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
according to the
same measurement.

00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:24.569 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Apparently it's so old that
a section of the handle

00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:27.972 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
had begun the
transformation to coal.

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:32.276 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The hammer's head, made
of more than 96% iron,

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is far more pure
than anything nature

00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:39.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
could have achieved without
an assistance from technology.

00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:43.254 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There had been a number of
intriguing finds in Indiana

00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
over the years,
including the discovery

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.594 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of eight skeletons, one
clad in copper armor

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:52.463 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
buried in a perfect circle.

00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:56.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In 1888, the Logan
Grey's, a military group

00:43:56.767 --> 00:44:01.305 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
led by A.M. Jones were
conducting military exercises

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on a small island on Eagle
Lake near Warsaw, Indiana.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Under a flat stone,
they discovered a hole

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:11.249 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that led to an entrance
to a secret cave

00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:16.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that was 25 feet long, 15
feet wide and eight feet deep.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:21.425 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Inside was the skeleton of
a six foot, nine inch giant

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:23.928 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
buried next to a
stream that led to what

00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:26.597 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
was called a sacred pool.

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In 1889, near Kewanna,
standing stones

00:44:28.933 --> 00:44:31.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
were found on a
mound and underneath

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:34.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
another giant was unearthed.

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:37.341 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
While in Whitlock,
Indiana another giant

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:39.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was found in association
with a group buried

00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:42.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
in a seating position.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:51.822 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
(Native American flute music)

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:12.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
One of the largest finds
on record was reported

00:45:12.677 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in "A History of
Jennings County Indiana"

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
published in 1885.

00:45:18.683 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It was reported that in 1881,
a nine foot tall skeleton

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.056 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
was unearthed in a local mound,

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:27.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
along with the body of
a blonde haired child.

00:45:27.692 --> 00:45:32.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And finally, in 1912 an
enormous jaw was dug up,

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that had double rows of teeth,

00:45:34.365 --> 00:45:37.535 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
a unique characteristic
of some giants discovered

00:45:37.535 --> 00:45:40.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in other parts of
the country as well.

00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:44.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What is believed to be the
largest Indian stone ax

00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:46.711 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in existence, is
among the collections

00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:49.714 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of the Missouri
Historical Society.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:53.718 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The ax is made of granite, it
measures 28 inches in length,

00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:57.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
14 inches in width and
11 inches in thickness

00:45:57.755 --> 00:46:01.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and weighs more than 300 pounds.

00:46:01.292 --> 00:46:04.328 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
When found, the pointed
end was embedded

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:06.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in a small mound of
boulders and pebbles

00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:09.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with the body and head
of the ax exposed.

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:13.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The hole apparently
forming a shrine or altar.

00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:16.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
The ax resembles
a tomahawk pipe,

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:19.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
its upper end or head
is slightly hallowed out

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:22.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and in this depression
was ceremoniously placed

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a small quantity of tobacco.

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:28.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A well beaten moccasin
trail led up the incline

00:46:28.586 --> 00:46:30.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of the eminence in
which the shrine stood,

00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:33.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
indicating that the
place had long been used

00:46:33.424 --> 00:46:36.227 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
for religious purposes.

00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:38.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
According to Chippewa tradition,

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:41.766 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the ax has been held in
veneration by these Indians

00:46:41.766 --> 00:46:44.568 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
from time immemorial.

00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:50.307 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Guadeloupe Woman is a
well authenticated discovery,

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
which has been in
the British Museum

00:46:52.343 --> 00:46:54.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for over half a century.

00:46:54.679 --> 00:46:57.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In 1812, on the coast
of the French Caribbean

00:46:57.114 --> 00:47:01.786 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
island of Guadeloupe, a fully
human skeleton was found,

00:47:01.786 --> 00:47:05.523 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
complete in every aspect
except for the feet and head.

00:47:05.523 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It belonged to a woman about
five foot two inches tall.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
What makes this of
great significance

00:47:11.696 --> 00:47:15.599 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is the fact that this
skeleton was found inside

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:18.769 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
extremely hard,
very old limestone,

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:23.441 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which was part of a formation
more than a mile in length.

00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:26.377 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Modern geological dating
places this formation

00:47:26.377 --> 00:47:29.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
at 28 million years old,

00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:33.150 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is 25 million
years before modern man

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is supposed to have
first appeared on Earth.

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:40.658 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Since such a date for a
regular person does not fit

00:47:40.658 --> 00:47:44.528 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
evolutionary theory, you will
not find Guadeloupe Woman

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:47.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
mentioned in any
hominid textbooks.

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:51.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
To do so would be to
disprove evolutionary dating

00:47:51.135 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of rock formations.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
When the two ton
limestone block,

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
containing Guadeloupe Woman,

00:47:56.841 --> 00:48:01.245 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
was first put on exhibit in
the British Museum in 1812,

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:05.716 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it was displayed as proof
of the Genesis flood.

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:08.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But that was 20
years before Lyell

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:11.722 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and nearly 50 years
before Darwin.

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:15.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In 1881, the exhibit
was quietly taken down

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:19.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to the basement and
remains there to this day.

00:48:28.506 --> 00:48:31.876 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
(Native American flute music)

00:48:31.876 --> 00:48:33.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Many giant skeletons
have been found

00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:38.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in or near Native American
mounds and burial places.

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:41.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Native Americans have many
legends regarding giants.

00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Here are just a few.

00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:46.590 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The Apache have a
legend about Big Owl,

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
a malicious and dangerous giant,

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
often used as a bogeyman
in children's stories.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In some Apache tribes,
Big Owl also plays

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.903 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
a more important
mythological role

00:48:58.903 --> 00:49:02.106 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
as an early adversary
of the War Twins.

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:04.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Like other legendary
Apache beings,

00:49:04.742 --> 00:49:06.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Big Owl is sometimes
described as

00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:10.481 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
having a human form, in
this case a man-eating ogre

00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:12.817 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and other times an animal form,

00:49:12.817 --> 00:49:14.819 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
such as a large horned owl,

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:18.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
large enough to
carry off a child.

00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:21.826 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Giwakwa are the evil
man-eating ice giants

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:24.328 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of southern Wabanaki legends.

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:26.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
According to most legends,

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:28.032 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Giwakwa was once a human being,

00:49:28.032 --> 00:49:31.101 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who either became
possessed by an evil spirit

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:33.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
or committed a terrible crime,

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:36.006 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
especially cannibalism
or withholding food

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:41.712 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
from a starving person, causing
his heart to turn to ice.

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:44.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In some Abenaki legends,
the stone giants

00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:46.784 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
were not transformed humans

00:49:46.784 --> 00:49:49.653 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but primordial
man-eating monsters

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:53.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
defeated by the
culture hero Gluskabe.

00:49:54.959 --> 00:49:57.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Kolowa is a kind of
hairy man-eating ogre

00:49:57.962 --> 00:50:01.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from Creek mythology, some
recent Creek storytellers

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:04.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have translated it to gorilla.

00:50:04.902 --> 00:50:07.972 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The Lofa is a malevolent,
ogre-like monster

00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:09.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of Chickasaw folklore.

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:12.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
His name literally
means flayer or skinner,

00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:16.413 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a reference to his gruesome
habit of flaying the skin

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:18.215 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
from his victims.

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:22.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In some legends, he attempts
to abduct Chickasaw women.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:25.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He is sometimes
described as a giant

00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:28.759 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and other times as a
large, hairy, smelly man,

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.362 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
leading some people
to associate him

00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
with the Bigfoot legend.

00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:40.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Moshup is giant, who
is the culture hero

00:50:40.738 --> 00:50:44.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of Mohegan and Wampanoag tribes.

00:50:44.008 --> 00:50:48.012 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Sometimes referred to as a
transformer by folklorists.

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:51.282 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Moshup is strongly
associated with whales.

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:53.851 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
In most most tribal traditions,

00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:56.420 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
he would catch whales
to fed the people.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.023 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And in some stories,
Moshup and his children

00:50:59.023 --> 00:51:03.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
eventually transform
into whales themselves.

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.030 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Moshup has a wife
named Squannit,

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:10.567 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who is a powerful medicine
woman of the Little People.

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:13.270 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Shampe is a malevolent,
ogre-like monster

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of Chickasaw folklore.

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:19.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In some legends, he attempts
to abduct Choctaw women.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.879 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
In others, he is a man-eater.

00:51:21.879 --> 00:51:24.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He is sometimes
described as a giant

00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:27.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and other times as
a large hairy man,

00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
leading some people
to associate him

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
with the Bigfoot
legends as well.

00:51:31.689 --> 00:51:34.491 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
His most salient
feature is his smell,

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:37.828 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Shampe smell is so overpowering

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:40.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that a person cannot be
bear to be around him,

00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:43.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
making him difficult to fight.

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:49.073 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Stoneclad is a monster
from Cherokee folklore.

00:51:49.073 --> 00:51:53.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Details about Stoneclad vary
from telling to telling.

00:51:53.344 --> 00:51:55.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
In some versions
there is only one,

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
while in other versions there
is a whole race of Stoneclads.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.721 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He is a stone-skinned
giant like the Stonecoats

00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:05.889 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
of the northern Iroquois tribe.

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:09.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In all cases, he has
rocklike plates of armor

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:13.063 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that protect him from
fire, cold and weapons.

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He's defeated only through
sapping his magical power

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
by destroying his talismans.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:37.921 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
(Native American flute music)

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:44.695 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Of course many Native legends
could simply be stories

00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:47.765 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
made up to keep
children in line.

00:52:47.765 --> 00:52:49.533 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But most historians
will tell you

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:53.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that legends are usually
rooted in some truth.

00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:56.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Native Americans who
encountered giants

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:59.343 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
would create stories to
pass the incidents down

00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:00.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
in oral tradition.

00:53:00.878 --> 00:53:03.514 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
With the discovery of
so many giant skeletons

00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:05.716 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
unearthed in the United States,

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:08.085 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it would have been impossible
for Native Americans

00:53:08.085 --> 00:53:11.855 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
to have never encountered them.

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:14.858 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There is strong evidence
that Native American folklore

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:17.394 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
about giants is true.

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:19.663 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Seven foot tall
skeletons have been found

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:22.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in burial mounds
of southeast towns

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that were home to the
ancestors of the Creek Indians.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.740 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
As European settlers pushed
across North America,

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
newspapers printed stories
about the discovery

00:53:32.443 --> 00:53:34.244 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of giant skeletons.

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Some were described as
being normal human beings,

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
but very tall.

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:43.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Others had skulls with
more primitive features.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.722 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The most credible stories
of giant skeletons

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:48.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
were concentrated
in the Appalachians,

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:51.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Cumberland Plateau
and Ohio Basin.

00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:53.764 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They were typically
found in graves lined

00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:56.900 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with stone slabs or field
stones, known as the

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
stone box grave culture.

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:02.806 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In 1821, seven
foot tall skeletons

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:05.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in stone-lined
sarcophagus were found

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:08.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in a White County,
Tennessee burial area.

00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:14.852 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Legends from Midwest tribes
tell of lightly pigmented,

00:54:14.852 --> 00:54:17.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
yellow or red haired
giants living around the

00:54:17.888 --> 00:54:20.224 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Great Lakes or southern Canada.

00:54:20.224 --> 00:54:23.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Occasionally these
giants travelled south

00:54:23.227 --> 00:54:24.828 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
into their territories.

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
While some encounters
were benign,

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.234 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
others resulted in warfare.

00:54:30.234 --> 00:54:32.202 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The Cherokees claimed
to have killed

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:36.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the last tall white Indians,
while still living in Kentucky

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and West Virginia.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:44.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Western pioneers sometimes
found what they assumed

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:46.683 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
were giant fossilized
human skeletons

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:49.253 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
along exposed
banks and in caves.

00:54:49.253 --> 00:54:51.588 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They described these
skeletons as much thicker

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.257 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
than modern humans.

00:54:53.257 --> 00:54:56.994 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Some claim the skulls
had double rows of teeth.

00:54:56.994 --> 00:55:00.130 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Several western tribes
tell of past confrontations

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.099 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
with lightly pigmented giants

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:04.935 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
with either blonde or red hair.

00:55:04.935 --> 00:55:07.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The Paiutes claim that
the giants were cannibals,

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
who hunted Paiutes for food.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.808 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They repeatedly
attacked the giants

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:14.077 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
until their numbers dwindled.

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:17.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The surviving giants
were cornered in a cave,

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:19.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
then either shot with
arrows or asphyxiated.

00:55:19.483 --> 00:55:22.452 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
by setting a fire
at the entrance.

00:55:31.295 --> 00:55:35.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In 1754, George
Washington was colonel

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:38.168 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of the Virginia
Colonial militia.

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:41.071 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
When hostilities
broke out with France,

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:44.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
he supervised construction
of Fort Loudon

00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:46.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in Winchester, Virginia.

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Laborers digging the
fort's foundation

00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:52.816 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
uncovered a cemetery
of seven foot skeletons

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and what appeared to be
Native American artifacts.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.324 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The skeletons were viewed
and reported by Washington.

00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:03.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It is not known what
happened to them.

00:56:03.327 --> 00:56:06.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This discovery gives
credibility to reports

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:10.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of seven foot tall skeletons
discovered in West Virginia,

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:14.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Kentucky, southern Ohio
and southern Indiana.

00:56:17.975 --> 00:56:21.845 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Thousands of years ago,
giants roamed the west.

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Their crude camps
and ferocious ways

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
terrorized the early
native settlers

00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:28.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that had wandered
across the land bridge

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
into the North
American continent

00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:32.990 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and traveled south and westward

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
into what later became the
west and great southwest

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.196 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of the United States.

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:42.132 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Tribes still speak
of these ancient days

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:45.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
when their ancestors
fought desperate battles

00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:47.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
against the marauding,
loping giants,

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:50.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
some towering 12
feet tall or taller,

00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:54.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that roamed the land viciously
attacking settlements,

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:56.446 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
brutally carrying
off screaming women

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and wailing children for food.

00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:29.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Of all of the indian
mounds that exist today,

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:33.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
most have barely
been investigated.

00:57:33.083 --> 00:57:36.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The few gigantic
skeletons found in some,

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
have been dismissed or
suppressed as aberrations.

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:45.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Ten and 12 foot humans do
not fit dogmatic theories.

00:57:45.429 --> 00:57:48.031 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Usually when giant
skeletons are found

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:50.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they're laughed off as hoaxes.

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:53.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Unfortunately, orthodox
science has too much to lose

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:57.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
by investigating the
mounds thoroughly.

00:57:57.708 --> 00:58:02.312 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Archaeologists cannot deny that
the Mound Builders are real.

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:03.914 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
What they deny are the things

00:58:03.914 --> 00:58:07.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
sometimes discovered
inside the mounds.

00:58:07.184 --> 00:58:09.386 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Over the past
century and a half,

00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:12.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
it's been revealed
again and again

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:15.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that some of the mounds,
and the small pyramids,

00:58:15.459 --> 00:58:18.195 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
are the burial
grounds of huge men

00:58:18.195 --> 00:58:20.464 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
often eight feet or taller,

00:58:20.464 --> 00:58:24.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that had a very
sophisticated culture.

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.703 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Some of the giants
have been found wearing

00:58:26.703 --> 00:58:31.007 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
intricate leather armor and
have been buried with swords.

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:34.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
One such giant was
found near Spiro Mound

00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:38.115 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
in Oklahoma during the 1930s.

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Who were these mysterious people

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:53.163 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that roamed America long
before the wooly mammoths

00:58:53.163 --> 00:58:55.499 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
became extinct?

00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:58.869 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Were they are ancestors or
another race of giant humans

00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:03.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
from a civilization
that predates our own?

00:59:03.507 --> 00:59:07.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
From the time settlers first
set foot on American soil,

00:59:07.244 --> 00:59:11.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
we have been finding
evidence of giants.

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.517 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Most of this evidence
has been destroyed

00:59:13.517 --> 00:59:16.920 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or sequestered away, in order
to either hide the truth

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.990 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or make it difficult
to quantify artifacts

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:22.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and harder to study.

00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:26.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
There does appear
to be a conspiracy

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to shelter evidence of giants,

00:59:28.532 --> 00:59:32.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and it has been going on
since science has been aware

00:59:32.202 --> 00:59:37.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the bones and materials
associated with these anomalies.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Our whole history would
change if all the evidence

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:43.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of giants could be revealed.

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:46.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Perhaps our civilization
is not yet ready

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:49.553 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to accept the existence
of those lofty beings

00:59:49.553 --> 00:59:52.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that roamed the
Earth centuries ago.

00:59:52.656 --> 00:59:57.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Or perhaps others have
made that decision for us.

00:59:57.561 --> 00:59:59.896 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And we are left with
only scant remnants

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:03.467 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of a civilization
larger than life.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:09.573 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Eventually more evidence and
artifacts will be discovered.

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:12.776 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Perhaps then we'll have
a more complete picture

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:16.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of our gigantic history.
