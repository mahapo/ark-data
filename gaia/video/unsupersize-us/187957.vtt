00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe these three lies are
the cause of most health issues

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:90%
we face today.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
"Unsupersize Me" clearly
showed impressive weight loss.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But what about people that
don't have 200 pounds to lose?

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:84%
What about people that
have health issues that

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
plague many of us even if
we're not morbidly obese?

Most Americans are on
some kind of medication

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and suffer from some
kind of health issue.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I asked myself the question
if those people were

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:84%
put on a whole-food,
plant-based diet and exercised,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:84%
would their health issues melt
away like Tracy's fat did?

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I decided to randomly pick
five people who would all

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
be considered normal by most
health standards and find out.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.193 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the filming
of "Unsupersize Us."

a round of applause.

[APPLAUSE]

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.185 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You guys are here because
what you've been doing

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been working.

You guys are here because
you're ready to change.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:90%
This program is six weeks long.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing a
whole-food, plant-based diet,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
one hour of resistance
training, and one

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
hour of cardiovascular
training six days a week.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
For my next experiment,
all five would

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
eat a whole-food, plant-based
diet, do an hour of cardio,

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and an hour of
resistance training

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
six days a week for six weeks.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
We'll see how the program
affects their body

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:84%
fat, their weight, their
measurements, and their blood

I spend most of my time working.

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
If I do get any free time,
I like to play with my dog.

I like to go to the movies,
read books, hang out

with my friends.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I let myself get hungry,
which I've realized

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:90%
is really dangerous for me.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
When I get hungry,
especially if I'm

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
going to go into a situation
like a dinner, meeting,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
or an event and there's
bad choices there,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
it makes it hard to
not choose to eat

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.016 align:middle line:84%
something that's not great
for you just to eat something.

[TYPING]

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I've struggled with my weight,
I think, since I can remember.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in like second
grade and kids calling me fat

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and making fun of me.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I gained and
lost weight kind

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
of throughout my childhood
and teenage years.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
After I graduated from UF, I
had already started my business

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and felt like I was
working 80 hours a week

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and living a pretty
unhealthy lifestyle,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
picking up McDonald's
in the morning

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
or in the middle
of night when I was

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:90%
driving to and from the office.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd gained
about 80 pounds

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
by the time I had really got my
company going in the beginning.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
only 5' 2", 5' 3",

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot, and it
doesn't look that great.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
turning point for me--

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
there was a picture
taken of me in a group.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:90%
We were on vacation in Key West.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other
girls were in bikinis

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and having a good
time and hanging out,

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was in these Capri pants
and this big baggy t-shirt.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.765 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
like a size 18 or 20.

00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:90%
They were pretty big.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just feeling
terrible about myself.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
When I saw that picture, I just
knew something had to change

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and I had to do something
different or else

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%

that for the rest of my life.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I probably suffered
from depression

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
since I was in my teens I
think, which means that I

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:90%
have really extreme lows.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do anything.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Like some days I would not
be wanting to get out of bed.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
The smallest things would
like make me angry or cry.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't have energy.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Like sometimes I would just
want to sleep all the time.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like just living under
like a horrible black cloud that

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:84%
makes everything in your life
seem negative and seem bad,

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.687 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see
the good in anything.

00:12:13.687 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like I had
this voice in my head

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that was telling me like
you don't deserve to live.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:90%
You're just a waste of space.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.382 align:middle line:90%
You're worthless.

00:12:23.382 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It would be better for you, it
would be better for everyone

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:90%
if you weren't here anymore.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.895 align:middle line:84%
It's a horrible place like where
all the joy, and the enjoyment,

00:12:32.895 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and the happiness has
been sucked out of life.

When you have celiac
and Crohn's, you

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.775 align:middle line:84%
learn very quickly
that you need to know

00:12:39.775 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:84%
where every single toilet in
your immediate vicinity is.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- well, it
either makes me feel sick,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
or it would make
my stomach hurt.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Either I can't go to the toilet,
and I'm really constipated.

Or I can't stop going.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I got uncontrollable diarrhea.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that really kind
of interferes with your life.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
That's just not
the easiest thing

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
to deal with because you're
always worrying about like,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:90%
oh, how near the toilet am I?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
What if I have to go out
of this meeting at work

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to go to the toilet?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be embarrassing.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
My doctor at the time
told me he did not

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
know if I was ever going to feel
any better, and that was just--

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that was devastating
because I had at one point

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
been very active and lived
a very kind of full life.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And the thought
that I might not be

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
able to work full time
anymore, that I might not ever

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
be able to do the things
that I enjoyed again because

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.325 align:middle line:84%
like my health had
just disappeared

00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%

like I'm looking

at possibly a life
of disability,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%

support myself properly.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%

And it kind of spooked
me because on the label

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
on the machine it says anything
that's like 160 over 100

is hypertensive emergency.

Mine was higher than that.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So I went straight
to the ER, and that's

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:84%
when I had my
first panic attack.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%

for the last couple of years,
and I know it's a bad habit,

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
but kind of felt
like I needed it.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I got used to taking something
to fall asleep at night,

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and coffee to wake
me up in the morning,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and wine to calm
me down after work.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:84%

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It's day 3, Monday.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of things I'm
thinking about this morning--

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
first is-- so we
started on Saturday.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And this weekend
was probably one

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:84%
of the first weekends
in a long time

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.985 align:middle line:90%
where I didn't eat like crap.

00:22:41.985 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a pattern
that I've gotten

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
into kind of eating
OK during the week

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and then eating whatever I
want to over the weekend, kind

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
of feeling like crap
on Monday and this

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
need to like restart
everything, some guilt.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel
any of that today.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I've been eating super healthy
all weekend long, exercising.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel great
today on a Monday.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first thing
that's happened in a while.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's still day 3 on Monday.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this realization
as I was drinking this smoothie

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that I just made after doing
my cardio that now when

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I eat food, I either immediately
or pretty soon thereafter

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
feel even better
than I did before,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
which is a big change
from eating something

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and wondering when it's
going to make you feel bad,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
like when your stomach
is going to kind of hurt

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
or when you're going
to be hungry again.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now, when I eat
food, it makes me feel good,

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's like it's
fuel and not something

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:90%
that's going to bring me down.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Today was day 6.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I had a great day today.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I mixed up my cardio
and played tennis today

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to just doing
my normal daily exercises.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I
like about this diet

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
better than all the other
diets I've ever been on is I'm

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
eating a lot, and I'm
still losing weight.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And I still feel pretty good.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Usually the type
of diets I go on

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
are crash diets, and low calorie
diets, and starvation diets.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And by this time,
I'm just dragging.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm pretty
happy with that.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of a rough night, but
I haven't moved my bowels yet.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling pretty rough.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Another night's sleep
of only a few hours.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm having some
digestive issues today.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Having only had
three hours of sleep

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and having constipation
for over 48 hours.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Day 4, and feeling very
discouraged this morning.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I had a rough night's
sleep last night.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I was having some
digestive issues.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like some
serious constipation.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
It's been like 36
hours, and I feel like I

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%
got a cement block in my colon.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:90%
It's so uncomfortable.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just makes me angry.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Like I just want to punch
myself in the stomach.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And like why can't I
move my [BLEEP] bowels?

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm so [BLEEP] pissed.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It angers me, you know?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like if
anybody's ever had

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
this issue and you sit on the
toilet and you're trying to go

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and you can't [BLEEP],, it's
like it just angers you.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like what the
[BLEEP] is wrong with me?

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so pissed.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
This is where I am right
now, and I'm [BLEEP] pissed.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:90%
I feel like punching something.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I feel.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> We're only one week in.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really happy with
how everyone's doing.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is feeling so much
better except for Gidon.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
He is still dealing with his
digestive issues and sleep

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I hope that things get better
for him really quickly.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Normally, a plant-based
diet and exercise

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.522 align:middle line:90%
improves everything right away.

00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:90%
So it's been a week in.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little bit concerned.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that he's going
to feel better very quickly.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.805 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Every week we get together
to share a plant-based meal

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and to talk about our
experiences from the week.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Don shared his blood
results with the group.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>> My results were real bad.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.167 align:middle line:90%
>> What were they?

00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I can say it on camera?

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> She wants my overall
cholesterol around 150.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was 222.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:84%
She wanted my
triglycerides under 300.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:90%
It was 600.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:90%
And my A1C under 55.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And it was 59.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So I got a lot of work to do.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
She's like you need to
come see me really quick.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, listen
I'm on these little plan.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.785 align:middle line:84%
Give me six weeks, and after
six weeks, can we retest?

00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not
the numbers you want,

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes, that's fine.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>> That's not just like
trying to lose some weight.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.037 align:middle line:90%
That's looking at some dire--

>> --consequences if
you don't make a change.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So Don was the
one who really was

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
like the most on the
fence about whether or not

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:90%
he was doing this.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
needed it the most.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
When we were at the dinner
table and Don told the group

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:84%
about his blood results,
I think everyone

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
was kind of shocked and really
concerned at the same time.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
This is more than just
wanting to lose weight.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:84%
These are some serious health
issues Don's looking at.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
These are all precursors
for stroke, diabetes, heart

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:90%
disease, cancer.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And as his longtime
friend, I was really

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:90%
concerned for his health.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So it made me
really want to focus

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
on making sure Don is
successful in this program.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.232 align:middle line:90%

If you've grown up
here or really anywhere

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.480 align:middle line:84%
in North Central Florida, you're
going to know what that is.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the big battleground
for the gators.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's really fun
to work out there.

challengers today guys.

nervous and not sure if I was

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
underprepared and just wanted
to be able to finish that day.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:90%
That was my goal.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.985 align:middle line:84%
is it your muscles
start seizing up a bit.

00:30:32.985 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to mentally
push through that stick point.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have to find a pace that
you can go to where you're not

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
like going to fall
down the steps

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and break your neck or anything
but you can still push yourself

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and still keep going.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Today was a good day.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
They all showed
determination and focus.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
This proved to me and to
them that what we're doing

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.170 align:middle line:90%
is working.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:84%
A couple weeks ago
none of the group

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:84%
would have thought that they
could have conquered The Swamp.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:84%
This was the first really
difficult challenge

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.345 align:middle line:90%
that we've done.

00:31:13.345 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really proud of
everyone for finishing.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:25.058 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.058 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So, yesterday, I ate
my normal breakfast,

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:90%
my normal snack.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
the car dealership,

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:84%
which for anyone who
hasn't bought a car lately,

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:90%
it takes forever.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there's
nothing to eat there.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.060 align:middle line:84%
My fault for not
taking anything.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.985 align:middle line:84%
So I was starving, going
to the grocery store.

00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I got hummus, got veggies,
got some healthy stuff.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Put them in the grocery bag
in the backseat of the car.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Drove back to the office.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:84%
The person sitting
in the front seat

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:84%
was eating a piece of pizza for
lunch and offered me a bite,

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and I was so hungry I
didn't even think about it.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
yeah, absolutely.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.552 align:middle line:90%
Took a bite.

00:31:59.552 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
took a bite, I was

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.330 align:middle line:84%
like, oh my god,
now I got to tell

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Carly and the rest of my team.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:90%
And I felt really bad about it.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a couple
of lessons here.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we know that
we don't get ravenous.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is going to fall
off the wagon sometimes

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and get ravenous and
just say give me that.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's lesson number one.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Lesson number two is
the important thing

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.927 align:middle line:84%
is Allison recognized what she
was doing, and she stopped.

00:32:26.927 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't eat the
whole piece just a bite.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And you just got to focus
on, hey, you know what,

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:84%
this bad food is going
to make me feel bad.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm actually glad that
Allison fell off track

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's a great
lesson for everyone.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Everyone falls off
track sometimes.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.280 align:middle line:90%
We're all human.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
is is you don't go off

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
into falling back into
your old bad habits

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:84%
again and just
continuing on with that.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You make a mistake, and
then you get right back

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:84%
on to what you
were doing before.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to fall off
once in a while.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.775 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure you continue
on with the new good habits

00:32:58.775 --> 00:32:59.650 align:middle line:90%
that you're creating.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Carly, I just didn't have time
to find something healthy.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
If only I have a dollar for
every time I heard that.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.440 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the
shopping challenge

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.930 align:middle line:84%
was to be able to
find a healthy snack

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.700 align:middle line:90%
in a short amount of time.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's always pressed
for time and in a hurry.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So in this challenge,
you have 5 minutes

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to find three healthy whole
food, plant-based items.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So the purpose of the
shopping challenge I thought

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.220 align:middle line:84%
was to kind of throw you
out in the wild in a way.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And just we went to the
store with the purpose

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:84%
of finding really quickly the
whole-food, plant-based snack

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.510 align:middle line:90%
that we could get.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have time
to think about it.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.208 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start on
the outside of the store.

00:33:50.208 --> 00:33:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I know that's where a lot
of that fresher things are.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Avoiding premade
food from the deli.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:90%
For a snack, dates.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:01.185 align:middle line:90%
The only ingredients dates.

00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Almonds-- ingredients almonds.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Something nice and
crunchy and fresh.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Organic baby carrots.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Ingredients carrots.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I think the purpose of the
time element in the shopping

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:17.219 align:middle line:84%
challenge was to really
mirror a real-life situation.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.487 align:middle line:90%
You're having a busy day.

00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, you're starving.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.445 align:middle line:84%
You gotta run in somewhere
and grab something

00:34:21.445 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:84%
before your next meeting,
and you don't always

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.659 align:middle line:90%
have hours to plan.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good
way to manage that.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know whole-food,
plant-based foods?

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And do you know how to quickly
find them in the supermarket?

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
purposes of the challenge

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that I could see was figuring
out what you wanted to get,

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:84%
kind of having an idea
of it, and executing it

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:48.499 align:middle line:90%
in a timely fashion.

00:34:48.499 --> 00:34:52.008 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the main pieces is
just avoid all the aisles that

00:34:52.008 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason to be in,
which is a lot of processed

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.383 align:middle line:90%
foods and stuff like that.

00:34:55.383 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Just go straight to the
fruits and vegetables area.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody show the camera.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.533 align:middle line:90%
>> I got dates.

00:35:05.533 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Went through the motions
and got baby carrots, walnuts,

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:08.970 align:middle line:90%
and dates.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:13.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Banana, walnuts,
and these kale chips,

00:35:13.437 --> 00:35:14.520 align:middle line:90%
which I wasn't sure about.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Carly said they were fine.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Did they pass inspection?

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> They passed inspection.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They got the
stamp of approval?

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Solid.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone found a whole-food,
plant-based snack within

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.018 align:middle line:84%
the time period, and I feel
confident that everyone is

00:35:26.018 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:84%
going to be OK on their own when
pressed for time and looking

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:90%
for a snack.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:90%
It's still early in the program.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But already we're seeing
some really cool changes.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.172 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Liz, so we're 10 days in.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And what's going on?

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So I just had to tighten
my belt again on my jeans.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:90%
So it was here.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And now it is here.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can't not wear a
belt on these anymore.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> So you're down how many?

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the one.

00:36:02.183 --> 00:36:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> One.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.233 align:middle line:84%
>> And I used to be able to
not wear a belt with these,

00:36:06.233 --> 00:36:08.650 align:middle line:84%
but now I can't get away with
that because they just start

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to fall down.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.245 align:middle line:84%
That was great because it was
proof that it was working.

00:36:13.245 --> 00:36:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I thought that that was me now.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to be
able to lose any weight.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to be able to
really do that much exercise

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.860 align:middle line:90%
because I've been so unwell.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So for that actually to
happen and to realize

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that something was
actually working

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and not only was
I feeling better,

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.526 align:middle line:84%
but the weight was
coming off, that

00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:44.470 align:middle line:84%
was amazing to actually
see that and to have

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:90%
some physical proof.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And Liz's skin has
cleared up quite a bit.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So because I've not really
been that happy with the way

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:90%
I've looked lately--

00:36:55.030 --> 00:37:00.026 align:middle line:84%
I used to put quite a lot
makeup on whenever I went out.

00:37:00.026 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I would kind of
spend a lot of time

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:84%
doing it and using
makeup in a clever way

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to kind of sort of shape my
face so that it would look

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:84%
like I had cheekbones and some
sort of definition to my face

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.155 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously,
when you put on weight,

00:37:16.155 --> 00:37:17.313 align:middle line:90%
it goes on your face.

00:37:17.313 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:90%
My face would be more round.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.248 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
I will probably

00:37:22.248 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
need to do that more every day.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe like more for
special occasions and stuff

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
because I like getting
dressed up now and then.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a lot easier.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Have the plants shaped
your face the way you like it?

00:37:33.743 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It shaped my
face, but, mostly,

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:90%
they've made my skin good.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the
best thing about it.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Alison has turned down
donuts in her office,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:84%
which that used to be a really
difficult thing for her.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.960 align:middle line:90%
She didn't even want them.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm in the office, and
they brought in cupcakes.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.568 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to have one
because I know I won't like it.

00:37:58.568 --> 00:37:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And it won't make me feel good.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The Whole-Food,
Plant-Based Iron Chef

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.830 align:middle line:90%
is one of my favorite events.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fun challenge.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone gets to test
their new cooking skills.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And we all get to try
some really tasty meals.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It starts off you get a brown
bag with two ingredients.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have one hour to cook
whatever two dishes you want.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:28.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to cook an entree, and
we have to cook an appetizer.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people had never cooked
with eggplant or beets before.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I've watched that show
on TV so many times

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I actually was
looking forward to it.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot harder
when you have less time,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.827 align:middle line:90%
but I still had a blast.

00:38:40.827 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Most of those ingredients
I've never cooked with before.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:90%
So they were challenging.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time I ever
worked with beets or eggplant

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.342 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:38:49.342 --> 00:38:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm very scared.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Getting the items in the bag
for the Iron Chef challenge was

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:84%
really fun because it made
you have to think on the spot

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.590 align:middle line:90%
for what you were going to do.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.380 align:middle line:84%
There was not really a way
to kind of plan for that.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So it was really exciting
to look in those bags

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and think, what are
we going to get?

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.746 align:middle line:84%
What's Carly going
to throw at us?

00:39:09.746 --> 00:39:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Just slicing some thin onions.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.708 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put them
in a quick pickle.

00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:84%
When I saw the eggplant
I knew exactly what

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I was going to make,
which I'm going

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.872 align:middle line:90%
to keep a secret for right now.

00:39:17.872 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:90%
But I'm excited.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I roasted the eggplants
and steamed it

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.710 align:middle line:84%
with some cinnamon and
smoked paprika, coriander,

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and basically made a baba
ganoush, a warm baba ganoush

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:90%
dip.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.575 align:middle line:84%
And I'm putting it
on fresh tomatoes.

00:39:33.575 --> 00:39:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Going to garnish it
with something green,

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.660 align:middle line:90%
a little more appetizing.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.630 align:middle line:90%
But tasted it.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Really happy with the
way it turned out.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> To be put under the pressure
to have to get a meal done

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
in a certain amount of time
only having these ingredients

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and having to put
those all together,

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:90%
a really difficult thing to do.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Currently googling eggplant
recipes to figure out what

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I came with no
pre-prepared meals in mind.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I was the least experienced
person in the kitchen

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
at that point and was worried
that I wouldn't even now what

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:90%
some of the ingredients were.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I got to watch three other
people who really knew what

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:84%
they were doing, four
other people who really

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:90%
knew what they were doing.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:90%
And we had a bunch of help.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think I learned a
lot that day about what

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:84%
different cooking tools were and
different ways of doing things,

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:90%
trying everybody's food.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I love food.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:90%
I love eating.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So I got to taste like 20
different things that day.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:90%
It was really neat.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> After the hour is up, the
judges get to taste each meal

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.980 align:middle line:84%
made by the contestants without
knowing who cooked what.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:90%
So there's no bias.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We go strictly on the
appearance of the dish,

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:84%
the taste of the dish, and
the uniqueness of the dish.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Could have been cooked a
little bit more and seasoned

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.965 align:middle line:84%
>> I did like the flavor, and
I did like the consistency.

00:40:58.965 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:84%
That's not always the easiest
thing to do, and especially

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.048 align:middle line:84%
with the temperature
because baba ganoush

00:41:03.048 --> 00:41:04.445 align:middle line:90%
you can have just warm or cold.

00:41:04.445 --> 00:41:05.615 align:middle line:90%
And so I did like that.

00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:90%
So that was very nice.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I love the eggplant.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a little hard
on the rim to cut.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that was
a challenge trying

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.182 align:middle line:84%
to get it ready in that
short amount of time.

00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I usually don't
like raw garlic,

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.180 align:middle line:90%
but this was really delicious.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a tight race.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, Molly's baba
ganoush and Liz's triple beet

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
hummus both won to advance
them to the dessert round.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't cook with these.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So Molly's a little bit more
of a tropical girl than Liz.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> These are tropical fruits.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Have some geographical
differences here.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Liz made a
tropical layered pot.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it
was Molly's date

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.120 align:middle line:84%
but cookie with a mango,
papaya compote that emerged

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:90%
with the Iron Chef crown.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:52.925 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.925 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> 2 and 1/2 points.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Very, very close girls.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.765 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.765 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was cool.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I was really inspired by
the Iron Chef competition.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I went home, I bought an apron.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I bought some new cooking stuff.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:90%
I bought a cookbook.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I was going to
make something new every day

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.043 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of that week.

00:42:11.043 --> 00:42:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was one of the
funnest things I've ever done

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:90%
in my life, honestly.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I love having a time constraint.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I work really well
under pressure.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I love cooking and
being creative with food.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of like
a perfect storm for me.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was
about creativity,

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.310 align:middle line:84%
about showing what you
can do with fresh fruit

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables, the things
that you can come up with,

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that you don't
really need to spend a lot

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of time in the kitchen to
come up with something healthy

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and that tastes good.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So since we've been
doing this project,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to work on
cooking at home a lot more.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And my cooking skills have
gotten so much better.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's been really
enjoyable because my daughter

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.087 align:middle line:90%
will come in and cook with me.

00:42:57.087 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's been a lot of fun.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The purpose of the Iron Chef
is to learn to use whatever

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:07.020 align:middle line:84%
resources you have around you,
whatever cooking utensils you

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:12.270 align:middle line:84%
have, whatever vegetables you
have, whatever spices you have.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It's so important in the whole
food, plant-based lifestyle

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that you learn how to cook
and you get comfortable

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.990 align:middle line:90%
in the kitchen.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.660 align:middle line:84%
To me, the fact that three
out of the five of these guys

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
had almost no experience
in the kitchen,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and they learned to make some
really healthy, tasty meals

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
in a very short period of time,
says that anyone can do it.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.975 align:middle line:84%
And I feel happy
and confident that I

00:43:35.975 --> 00:43:37.350 align:middle line:84%
know they can go
out on their own

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and provide themselves some
healthy, tasty meals very

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
easily.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:84%
This week we did the swimming
and biking challenges.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted everyone
to learn how to do

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:84%
a different type
of cardio, other

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.475 align:middle line:84%
than walk and running
and cardio machines.

00:43:55.475 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you get to do
something different that's fun.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Number two, swimming and
biking are very low impact.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.180 align:middle line:84%
If you have any kind of knee
injuries, ankle injuries,

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:84%
or hip injuries, lower back
injuries, low impact is great.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We had some fun things happen.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Don was able to do a dolphin
flip, which he hasn't

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:90%
been able to do in years.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The dolphin flip was
something I learned when I was

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.347 align:middle line:84%
on the Hawaii swim
team when I was a kid.

00:44:19.347 --> 00:44:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's been very difficult
because my belly's always

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:22.460 align:middle line:90%
gotten in the way.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So it was much easier
when I dropped some weight

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:26.695 align:middle line:90%
to be able to hit that flip.

00:44:26.695 --> 00:44:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at this guy.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:90%

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Watch out, homie!

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Watch out.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Watch out.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.735 align:middle line:90%
This guy's a swimmer.

00:44:34.735 --> 00:44:35.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how you do it.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.910 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The bike races
were mostly close.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But Liz and Gidon
leading the way.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.990 align:middle line:90%
There she goes.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.515 align:middle line:90%
She's looking strong.

00:44:49.515 --> 00:44:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> To have another option for
cardio is good because it just

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.300 align:middle line:84%
decreases the number of excuses
you can make for not doing

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.760 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone remembered how
much fun it is to ride a bike.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And we only had one hiccup.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Allison couldn't really
balance the bike at first.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:15.876 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.876 --> 00:45:16.676 align:middle line:90%

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize
we were going to be

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:90%
teaching you to ride a bike.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But eventually she got
going, and it was just

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.730 align:middle line:90%
like riding a bike.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.620 align:middle line:84%
She got going again and was
able to complete the challenge.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So all in all, it was
a very successful day,

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and I think everyone learned
some new types of cardio to do.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:40.330 align:middle line:90%

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I have run this
exact race before.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.740 align:middle line:84%

I mean walked it.

pace myself and run the whole

I'm not really worried
about the time.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I'd like to
run the whole time

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:84%

my belt. So that's my goal.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.760 align:middle line:84%

everyone to feel what

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
it's like to strap
a number on and feel

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.130 align:middle line:84%
that adrenaline pumping
through your veins

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Everyone sprints out.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:39.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a really exhilarating,
fun, and unique experience.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think as everyone gets
fitter and more in shape,

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:47.720 align:middle line:84%
it's important to do races and
get out there and use your body

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and push yourself to the
limit, see what you can do.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Most of these guys have
never run a race before

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and were a little
nervous about it.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:05.253 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.253 --> 00:47:07.670 align:middle line:84%

I feel like I
really paced myself,

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:18.033 align:middle line:84%

I was going for.

00:47:18.033 --> 00:47:19.450 align:middle line:84%
I was really going
to just finish,

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:22.740 align:middle line:90%
so I'm really proud of myself.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And I showed up.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And I-- it wasn't
about winning for me.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just about going
my own pace, and I did.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You did it.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.440 align:middle line:90%

Come on.

00:47:45.135 --> 00:47:46.810 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm feeling good.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little exhausted.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:middle line:90%
But I ran the whole time.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
the pace that we

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.600 align:middle line:84%
would run when we
all ran together

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.360 align:middle line:90%
in a kind of sweet spot.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.318 align:middle line:90%
And I think I found it.

00:47:56.318 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'm happy.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:90%
That was my first 5K.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You did awesome.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> From not being able to really

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:15.814 align:middle line:84%
people and fit people, that's
a pretty neat experience.

00:48:15.814 --> 00:48:16.614 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:16.614 --> 00:48:18.087 align:middle line:90%

Woo!

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody finished.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Nobody walked.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Everyone could say
they did a 5K race.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And they also got that racing
experience that I think

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is so important as you
regain your health.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Eating plant based on the
road, very, very important

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to do.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.780 align:middle line:84%
How often do people
go on a trip,

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.240 align:middle line:84%
flying somewhere or
driving somewhere,

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and end up eating
something bad and unhealthy

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:84%
because they think they
don't have any other options?

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:02.450 align:middle line:84%
You actually do
often have options.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
wanted them to learn.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So everyone got assigned one
major restaurant or fast food

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
chain that you normally wouldn't
think has healthy options.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You really don't think
they have healthy options.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had to find two healthy
whole food, plant-based meals

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.620 align:middle line:90%
That was their assignment.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>> In the fast food challenge,
I was assigned McDonald's.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess that implies that
Carly has faith in my ability

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.690 align:middle line:84%
to make good choices because
it was probably the hardest

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:38.230 align:middle line:90%
one of the whole challenge.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the menu
really closely there

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.950 align:middle line:90%
for the fast food challenge.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:84%
There were a few
things that were--

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
seemed like they
might be healthy,

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:90%
but they really weren't.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, some salad
dressings I got,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I actually looked into the
ingredients in salad dressings.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And they all had high
fructose corn syrup

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of preservatives.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And so my only options
were a side salad

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that only had lettuce and
one cherry tomato on it

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and then unsweet ice tea,
which probably wasn't that good

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.160 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I did not have a
lot of confidence

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.630 align:middle line:90%
in the McDonald's employees.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I
ordered the salad,

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.370 align:middle line:84%
the girl actually tried to
discourage me from ordering it,

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:25.020 align:middle line:84%
telling me that it only had
lettuce and tomato on it.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.733 align:middle line:84%
But I assured her that that's
all I wanted from McDonald's.

00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to order
as a side salad.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have a
salad, if you could--

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:90%
side salad.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the hardier of
the two salads, that one.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:42.450 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Would you say those
are both plant based?

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no additives or
preservatives or anything

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.310 align:middle line:90%
crazy in there?

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't
have fresh lemons.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.045 align:middle line:84%
They had a lemon
little package here.

00:50:55.045 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's preservatives
in the lemon.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.470 align:middle line:90%
So I chose not to do the lemon.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go with a
cucumber to put in my water.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, so now I have
cucumber in my water.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll let it sit
for a little bit.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully that will do the
trick, give me a little flavor.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's hope that
takes care of everything

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that I'm supposed to have,
hopefully, plant-based wise.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for all
your help tonight.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen, I am
here at Moe's Southwest Grill.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ready to
do my challenge.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:41.098 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the salsas that have
no processed ingredients.

00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be
the tomatillo salsa,

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.580 align:middle line:84%
the mango tomatillo salsa,
and the ghost pepper salsa.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my man.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In the end, everyone
did really well.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Everyone found some whole
food, plant-based meals

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and learned how to eat
healthy on the road,

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.060 align:middle line:84%
extremely important, and
I'm really proud of everyone

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.227 align:middle line:90%
for learning how to do that.

00:52:01.227 --> 00:52:06.910 align:middle line:90%


00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:10.450 align:middle line:84%
This week I really increased
the intensity in the gym.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:14.110 align:middle line:84%
We're doing a little bit
more heavy cardio exercises,

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.850 align:middle line:90%
more body weight movements.

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I always encourage people to do
movements that your body's not

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:84%
used to, gets you stronger,
increases your calorie burn,

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps things a
little more interesting.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.320 align:middle line:84%
We have some tough
challenges coming up ahead.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And I want everyone to be ready.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:32.750 align:middle line:90%
We're in.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:58.070 align:middle line:90%


00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Carly was relentless
today and pushing us beyond--

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel like pushing us in
the segments that we have,

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:12.140 align:middle line:90%
2,000 meters that we rode today.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> This week has
been really tiring.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I feel super hungry.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I feel very energetic.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I used to take a long
time, I think, to recover.

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd be kind of huffing and
puffing and resting and sitting

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.283 align:middle line:84%
and laying down on the
ground and taking my time

00:53:26.283 --> 00:53:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to get to the next exercise.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:30.235 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel like I can
go a lot more back to back.

00:53:30.235 --> 00:53:31.360 align:middle line:90%
And I feel great right now.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people that are out
of shape don't play sports.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've been working
out for a few weeks,

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.900 align:middle line:84%
everyone's gotten
a lot stronger.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Their cardio's
gotten a lot better.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:51.180 align:middle line:84%
We can focus on just having
fun and playing a sport.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So I organized a tennis clinic
by Don, who's in the challenge.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.700 align:middle line:84%
He's also the owner of DB
Racquet Club and a very

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:90%
high-energy, fun tennis coach.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I know how much
I love tennis.

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And tennis is a
game of a lifetime.

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want to introduce
tennis to them

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:10.215 align:middle line:84%
as a part of another means
of getting some cardio in.

00:54:10.215 --> 00:54:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just think that
that would really

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.440 align:middle line:90%
help them enjoy cardio more.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're out of shape,
tennis is not fun.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.812 align:middle line:84%
When you're in shape,
tennis is a blast,

00:54:18.812 --> 00:54:20.270 align:middle line:84%
because you get
more balls in play.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:90%
You run down more balls.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.730 align:middle line:90%
So they had a blast.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was laughing.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
tennis should be.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.670 align:middle line:90%


00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go now.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.174 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:54:30.174 --> 00:54:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Drop it.

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.347 align:middle line:84%
>> So we all got
to get out there,

00:54:34.347 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:84%
hit a few forehands and
backhands, ran a few suicides.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Overall I think everyone
learned that you

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.480 align:middle line:90%
can have fun playing sports.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It's good to be in shape so
your body can move around,

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.393 align:middle line:84%
and you can do lots of different
stuff to burn calories.

00:54:47.393 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.360 align:middle line:84%
We've been on a whole
food, plant-based diet

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and our exercise regimen
for a little while now.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to test
everyone's fitness level

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:05.655 align:middle line:84%
and challenge them with
something really difficult.

00:55:05.655 --> 00:55:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the car push/sled pull
is pushing a 5,000-pound car

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:16.630 align:middle line:84%
for 100 meters followed by
pulling 90 pounds for about 200

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.060 align:middle line:90%
meters for time.

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It is a true test of
your fitness level

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:26.170 align:middle line:84%
to see where you are and
see what you can withstand

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.720 align:middle line:84%
because your muscles go
into complete failure,

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to reach down
inside yourself and still keep

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the car push was
probably one of the toughest

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:59.520 align:middle line:90%
things that we did.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gosh.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is one
of those challenges

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.250 align:middle line:84%
that it was just kind
of ridiculous and fun.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:10.402 align:middle line:84%
And we felt like Carly was
just adding new things to it

00:56:10.402 --> 00:56:15.380 align:middle line:84%
for just his own entertainment,
to see if we could do it.

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You're gaining momentum.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.300 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Now come strong with it.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One word to describe the
car push challenge is humbling.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.485 align:middle line:84%
What was different about
this challenge as opposed

00:56:26.485 --> 00:56:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to the other challenges,
your entire body

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.500 align:middle line:84%
is being worked in
that car challenge.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.950 align:middle line:84%
This was definitely the
most grueling challenge yet.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Pushing that car and
wearing that weight vest

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:39.105 align:middle line:84%
was about as close to
a near-death experience

00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:41.130 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever had.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Extremely difficult. I mean,
definitely the hardest thing,

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.092 align:middle line:90%
without a doubt.

00:56:48.092 --> 00:56:50.522 align:middle line:90%
[GRUNTING]

00:56:50.522 --> 00:56:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And I actually, going into it,
I knew it would be challenging.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But I never in my
wildest imagination

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:02.030 align:middle line:84%
thought it would be
that challenging.

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So right from the start, right
from the very first second,

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to push this SUV
and starting to roll backwards.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I was pushing with all my
might just to get it started

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and exerting all this energy
right from the first second.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Go.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Push it!

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.376 align:middle line:90%
Push it!

00:57:19.376 --> 00:57:20.310 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And then once I got finished
pushing the SUV to where it

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:28.050 align:middle line:84%
needed to be, I was like,
wow, my energy's so zapped.

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm already super,
super, super exhausted.

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, why
is the sled so far away?

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't we put it closer?

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I was really, really
proud of everyone.

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I think they all found
a physical strength

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:45.810 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know they had and
a mental strength they didn't

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:47.160 align:middle line:90%
know they had.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.550 align:middle line:84%
At the end, everyone was
completely physically

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.140 align:middle line:90%
and mentally exhausted.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.855 align:middle line:90%
That was really, really tough.

00:58:01.855 --> 00:58:04.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:58:04.427 --> 00:58:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That was awesome.

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.624 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:58:07.624 --> 00:58:10.758 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
hardest thing we did.

00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That was awesome.

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:13.307 align:middle line:84%
>> I love you
because I can do it.

00:58:13.307 --> 00:58:14.737 align:middle line:90%
But god, I hate you right now.

00:58:14.737 --> 00:58:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoo!

00:58:18.975 --> 00:58:21.830 align:middle line:90%
[BLEEP] Mother [BLEEP].

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Put that on tape, [BLEEP].

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And I never curse, man.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Holy Jesus.

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Sweet Jesus.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:30.430 align:middle line:90%
[BLEEP]

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:31.615 align:middle line:90%
Mother of god.

00:58:31.615 --> 00:58:32.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> [BLEEP]

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this going to be
appropriate for your family,

00:58:37.016 --> 00:58:37.816 align:middle line:90%
Don?

00:58:37.816 --> 00:58:42.030 align:middle line:90%


00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself somewhat
of a novice gardener.

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to show everyone
what goes into our vegetables,

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.430 align:middle line:84%
how we get them,
where they come from.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Also, gardening
is great exercise.

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So we did a little
calorie burn too.

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the purpose of the
farming challenge was really

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to kind of get our hands dirty
and really see where our food

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:07.360 align:middle line:90%
is coming from.

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.050 align:middle line:84%
We just spent weeks and
weeks eating nothing

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:13.600 align:middle line:90%
but fruits and vegetables.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was really nice to
remember all the work that

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.420 align:middle line:90%
goes into that.

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We just kind of go
to the grocery store

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and got tomatoes or bananas.

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was really awesome having
to go through all that steps.

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.330 align:middle line:90%
We weeded the garden.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We got all the chunks out.

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:32.670 align:middle line:84%
We made it look nice
and then planted

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:35.103 align:middle line:84%
these adorable little tomato
plants that I actually got

00:59:35.103 --> 00:59:36.270 align:middle line:90%
to eat some tomatoes off of.

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> The farming was fun.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the purpose
of the farming challenge

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:51.270 align:middle line:84%
was to get out into the
outdoors, get your hands dirty,

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
grow some stuff.

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Previously, I had zero
interest in gardening.

00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:01.285 align:middle line:84%
Now I find myself out
there helping my wife.

01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest with you,
it's actually a great workout.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:08.430 align:middle line:84%
The cardio, my upper body,
shoulders, arms, biceps.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So the workout aspect of
the garden challenge was kind

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.910 align:middle line:90%
of unexpected.

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I guess I haven't really
done a lot of gardening.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I imagine kind of
sitting on your knees

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:20.380 align:middle line:90%
with cute little gloves.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what it was at all.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely get
some rakes and hoes

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and you know your knees
and your back and your arms

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.480 align:middle line:90%
and getting sweaty and dirty.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.990 align:middle line:90%
But it was really fun.

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really nice to just be
able to go out to your garden

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:35.550 align:middle line:90%
and pick things.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And you have a better
relationship with your food

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:40.390 align:middle line:90%
and where it comes from.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And you appreciate
it more when you

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.530 align:middle line:90%
put the effort into growing it.

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We like colors because that
means lots of vitamins.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think overall the
project was a success.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Everyone got their hands
dirty and learned a little bit

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.644 align:middle line:84%
about gardening and had
a good time doing it too.

01:00:55.644 --> 01:01:01.790 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
As a guy, I am not a
huge clothes shopper.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But there is a part of this
program I always really enjoy

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
when the girls feel good
about themselves again

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and are excited to go shopping.

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going in to
TJ Maxx to do what?

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Clothes shopping!

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I have
dropped a dress size.

01:01:26.865 --> 01:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
hanging off my ass.

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what are
we going to get?

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I would really love to find
some jeans and I can actually

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
wear something that's figure
hugging would be nice.

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:39.020 align:middle line:90%


01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Normally I don't
like clothes shopping

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:43.068 align:middle line:84%
because I find
like nothing fits,

01:01:43.068 --> 01:01:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really
self-conscious, particularly

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
about my stomach area.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.010 align:middle line:90%
But not so much now.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.780 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see how this goes.

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> What size were you before?

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I was like an 8 to 10.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And now more of a 6 to 8.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a bit more enjoyable
because I can kind of think--

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a bit more confidence
that things might fit me

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.251 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm not going
to have a big muffin top.

01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:09.983 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.983 --> 01:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] not going
to have a muffin top.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
seeing Liz's face

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
when she tried on new sizes
that were two sizes smaller

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.450 align:middle line:90%
than what she had before.

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And she looked like
a little girl again.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
She was so excited to fit
into these new clothes.

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's rewarding for me
to see how happy they are

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.225 align:middle line:90%
feeling good about themselves.

01:02:31.225 --> 01:02:32.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is a
really interesting buy.

01:02:32.975 --> 01:02:35.192 align:middle line:90%
I have a pair of jeans that fit.

01:02:35.192 --> 01:02:36.440 align:middle line:90%
- Let's see them.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable, check this out.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see them.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That is unbelievable.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
If someone had said
to me six weeks ago

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that I would be
fitting into these,

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I would have just been
like, yeah, whatever.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.312 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:02:52.312 --> 01:02:53.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Now you do.

01:02:53.112 --> 01:02:55.112 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess I thought
I would shrink a little,

01:02:55.112 --> 01:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
but not this much, not
to be picking up size 6s,

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
or 10s if you're in
the UK, off the rail,

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're just going,
hey, look at me.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.480 align:middle line:90%
My size 6s fit.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Shopping when you don't feel
good about yourself is torture.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.640 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.223 align:middle line:84%
You kind of go in
there with a mindset

01:03:11.223 --> 01:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that nothing's
going to work out,

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's all going to
make me feel terrible.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And then shopping
when you do feel good

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.020 align:middle line:90%
about yourself is really fun.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that you-- it's
easier to find clothes

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that kind of fit your
mood when you're happier,

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
when you know things
are going to look good.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot more fun.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
material I might have

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
avoided before because
it's kind of tight,

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and it shows everything.

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:36.410 align:middle line:90%
But I feel--

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Elastic.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] it is an eight.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And before I was wearing,
like, a 12 in dress sizes.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

01:03:42.696 --> 01:03:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's three dress sizes.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is an eight.

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We grabbed a 8 and
a 10 off the rack.

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Thought I'd try the eight first.

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It definitely fits.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely fits.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
It's got this little
belt in the middle that

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
ties in and shows off my waist.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.272 align:middle line:90%
Looks nice.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I love Calvin Klein.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.815 align:middle line:90%
They're one of my favorites.

01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I feel really good
in this dress.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I can really see myself
wearing this to work

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.830 align:middle line:90%
in a meeting.

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
It looks good.

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:13.377 align:middle line:84%
>> That feels good
that that dress fits.

01:04:13.377 --> 01:04:21.640 align:middle line:90%


01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> A popular alternative to
diet and exercise are stomach

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.330 align:middle line:90%
surgeries.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to a couple of people
who have had these surgeries.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a food addict,
just like an alcoholic.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm addicted to food.

01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And I had gastric
bypass in 2003.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I lost almost 100
pounds from it.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And I am 10 pounds away from
my heaviest that I used to be.

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So you lost about 115 pounds.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you've now
gained it all back.

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, minus 10 pounds.

01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Minus 10 pounds.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think
that happened?

01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> They fixed--

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my stomach's smaller.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.470 align:middle line:90%
But they never fixed my mind.

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So I still looked at
food the same way.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.250 align:middle line:90%
My name is Carole.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And about six years ago
I weighed 235 pounds.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had tried dieting off
and on, but was unsuccessful.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw these billboards
all around Orange County

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and Riverside where I live about
weight loss, lap band surgery.

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It was rough out there
dating, like match.com.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.415 align:middle line:84%
I would get feedback
from guys that

01:05:39.415 --> 01:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
would tell me, oh, you
have a pretty face,

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:44.870 align:middle line:90%
but too bad you're overweight.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So that really kind
of got into my head.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Carole decided she was
tired of being overweight.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
After a little
research, she decided

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.700 align:middle line:90%
to have the lap band surgery.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I was happy as
far as losing weight.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.340 align:middle line:90%
But I was very tired.

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.050 align:middle line:90%
I'd often pass out at work.

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'd get
hospitalized and have

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to have blood transfusions,
or at least an IV of saline

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:10.940 align:middle line:90%
because I was so dehydrated.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I was only able to
eat two or three bites

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.080 align:middle line:90%
at a time for a meal.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
If I ate anything more,
I'd started throwing up.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I was throwing up anywhere
between two and six

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:22.260 align:middle line:90%
times a day.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up happening is
I started going to the doctor.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was having erosion in
my esophagus from all the

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:29.000 align:middle line:90%
throwing up.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
My teeth were rotting
because of all the vomiting.

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Then I started having just
stomach problems in general.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening is
I had a hernia right where

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
the lap band was, is I got blood
poisoning called severe septis.

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
My stomach was
rotting inside of me.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Half of my esophagus
was rotting inside me.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:53.415 align:middle line:84%
I was so sick that
I was hospitalized.

01:06:53.415 --> 01:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
They put me in a
medically induced coma

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.310 align:middle line:90%
for about two weeks.

01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I had 22 drains throughout
my body to just drain out

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.970 align:middle line:90%
the infection that my body had.

01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:07.890 align:middle line:90%
I had kidney dialysis.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So that was pretty rough
living in the hospital

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:13.400 align:middle line:90%
for 3 and 1/2 months.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.020 align:middle line:90%
I finally did get out.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it like when
you woke up from that coma?

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I was very confused.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd only been in the
hospital for a couple of days.

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And I found out I had been
in there for two months.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
22 hours a day I was
attached to this machinery.

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:30.500 align:middle line:90%
The machinery was heavy.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I had to attach it to a walker
because was too weak to carry

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
the backpacks of the machinery.

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I literally just went
from my couch to the restroom.

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I got blood clots on my legs
because of lack of movement.

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:43.460 align:middle line:90%
They went into my lungs.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And I got bilateral
pulmonary embolism, which

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:49.220 align:middle line:90%
is blood clots in my lungs.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And so now what I
have is an ileostomy.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
It's similar to a colostomy bag.

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But colostomy bag's
on the left side.

01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Mine's on the right.

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And you can see all the scars.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And then you can see also--

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
see, I'm still trying
to heal this up.

01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
What's happening now is I'm
going to a wound doctor.

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I
had this surgery

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:14.000 align:middle line:84%
was to have better self-esteem
and to look prettier.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.359 align:middle line:84%
And now my self-esteem
is lower than ever,

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.580 align:middle line:84%
going to counseling
twice a week.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And as far as getting
a better body,

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.069 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know that this
is a better body, with this bag

01:08:25.069 --> 01:08:26.660 align:middle line:90%
and all the scars, so.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.729 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot stress enough that
surgery is not the right path.

01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:33.979 align:middle line:84%
Carole Doyne would give
anything to go back in time

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:36.359 align:middle line:90%
and choose diet and exercise.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.639 align:middle line:84%
These are not the first
unsuccessful surgeries

01:08:38.639 --> 01:08:39.439 align:middle line:90%
I've seen.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, I haven't seen

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
one surgery that is
without complication

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.727 align:middle line:90%
and was successful.

01:08:45.727 --> 01:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
fault of the doctors.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:48.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the fault of the surgery.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The surgery is where
the problem lies.

01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
When you go in your body
and you cut in, of course,

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:54.649 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
run into infection

01:08:54.649 --> 01:08:55.689 align:middle line:90%
and other complications.

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:57.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not a natural process.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.899 align:middle line:84%
Diet and exercise are
the only way to go.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:05.399 align:middle line:90%


01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:10.649 align:middle line:84%
>> I go through my whole day
without having any moments

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:11.520 align:middle line:90%
of tiredness.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.173 align:middle line:84%
Before around-- like after
lunch about, 1 o'clock, 1:30,

01:09:15.173 --> 01:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I would kind of get tired,
maybe go get a second cup

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%
of coffee or even a Diet Coke.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:23.021 align:middle line:84%
And now I just power
through my days.

01:09:23.021 --> 01:09:24.479 align:middle line:84%
It's easier for me
to get up early,

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:27.779 align:middle line:84%
so I can get some stuff
done in the morning.

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I can think
through things more clearly.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:32.482 align:middle line:84%
I'm just full of
ideas for lessons.

01:09:32.482 --> 01:09:33.899 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my
creativity has just

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.732 align:middle line:84%
gone through the roof,
which has been great.

01:09:35.732 --> 01:10:02.270 align:middle line:90%


01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The other big thing for me
that's happened is a huge shift

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in my mental health
throughout this program.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I've suffered from
depression and anxiety

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
for the majority
of my adult life.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been on various psychiatric
medications over the years.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I've had periods where my
mental health has definitely

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
impacted on my career
and my personal life.

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I have now become
psychiatric medication free.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer taking my SSRIs.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the six weeks,
I reduced my dose gradually

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to the point where now I am
drug free, completely drug free.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Carly once told me that his
Cuban grandfather said to him

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
when he was a little
boy, a man who

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.370 align:middle line:90%
has his health is a rich man.

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And now I know
exactly what he means.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
To have found a way of managing
those health conditions

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
without having to take
a ton of medication that

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
makes me sick, to be free of the
worst symptoms of what I had,

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
it means everything
because, like I say,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I thought that that was it.

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought I wasn't
going to get better.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to
be stuck in that place

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and that that was the
best life was going to be.

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
For that to not be the case
anymore, it's everything,

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.055 align:middle line:90%
I can't even--

01:11:20.055 --> 01:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
it's really-- it's hard to
describe what it's like.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I have to pinch myself
when I'm going out for a run.

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, am I
actually really doing?

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Am I running?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
When two years ago, I could
barely get out of bed.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.351 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't-- sometimes it
doesn't even feel real yet.

01:11:38.351 --> 01:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%


01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem was
you had bowel issues.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.040 align:middle line:90%
How has that changed?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm moving
my bowels regularly.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
like an all-day affair.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.050 align:middle line:90%
TMI.

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:00.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's the truth.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm sleeping more soundly,
which is a huge change.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel much more
well rested when I wake up.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So whereas before when I
woke up, I'd be sluggish.

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd be dragging for a good
half an hour to an hour.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Usually within the
first 10 to 15 minutes

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I start feeling ready for
the day, very unusual for me.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's a huge change.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy thing to build
workouts into your schedule.

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
But you do it and once
you start sticking to it,

01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes a
way of your life.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:47.560 align:middle line:90%


01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a part of my life.

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
I wake up, and I go to the gym.

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any reason
that I would stop that.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:04.303 align:middle line:90%


01:13:04.303 --> 01:13:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> At the very beginning,
when he told us the rules,

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought for sure that I was
going to be the first person

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to gain weight doing this
because I love fruit,

01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and I love potatoes and those
things that you're not really

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
supposed to eat when you're
doing a low-carb diet,

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
oatmeal and all these things
I hadn't had in a while.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I'm just
going to trust Carly.

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:26.980 align:middle line:90%
He's done it before.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.263 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen other people
have success with it.

01:13:30.263 --> 01:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Figure worst case I would
get to eat some good food,

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:33.880 align:middle line:90%
prove you wrong.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%
But I was up in those--

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.485 align:middle line:84%
potatoes-- I got to
eat so many potatoes.

01:13:38.485 --> 01:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a night where
I probably ate, like,

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.650 align:middle line:90%
five potatoes by myself.

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And I felt really bad about it.

01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I was like, there's
no way I'm going

01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:47.920 align:middle line:90%
to lose weight doing that.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And then?

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I lost 13 pounds
in 6 weeks and 6 inches

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.830 align:middle line:90%
on my waist.

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:58.850 align:middle line:90%


01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:59.835 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people--

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and I'm guilty of this too.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look at
somebody who has lost weight

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.648 align:middle line:84%
or has gotten in shape or
someone who just looks great,

01:14:06.648 --> 01:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you don't
know their story,

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and your first reaction is to
say, gosh, they're so lucky.

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
They're so lucky
that they look like.

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
They're so lucky
they can do that.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot of
hard work behind that.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not luck.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think knowing that
you feel good and look good

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and that you can do
everything at kind

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.320 align:middle line:84%
of your peak performance,
that gives you

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that confidence that you need
to be able to walk into a room

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.890 align:middle line:90%
and do that.

01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
If you look like you can do
it, people trust that you can.

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Health is everything.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's your foundation for
everything else in your life.

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
If your health isn't
where it needs to be,

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty difficult to
do anything else well.

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been wanting to wear nice
clothes, such as Lululemon,

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.710 align:middle line:90%
for a long time now.

01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And after six weeks,
I can wear it.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I went from a double extra
large to an extra large

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.410 align:middle line:90%

I actually went to the ER
three times in one year.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.800 align:middle line:90%
That was a huge wake-up call.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Sitting in that hospital
room, alls I could think about

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.060 align:middle line:90%
was my kids staring at--

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
when I was staring
at the ceiling.

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't have to
worry about that anymore.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%

just keep doing what

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing I'm going
to be here longer,

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%

to be able to spend
