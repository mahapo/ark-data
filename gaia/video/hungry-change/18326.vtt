00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>All through our
history as a species,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
the big challenge
is to find calories.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, our bodies are
biological adapted to this.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:90%
We seek calorie sources.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
When I say that, particularly,
what I'm talking about

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:90%
are fats and sugars.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
If we taste something
fatty or something sweet,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
we get an immediate
signal saying, yes.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
I want more of this.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:84%
up to a few hundred
years ago-- anywhere

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%

sugar meant survival

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%
for those people.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It meant carrying

>>It's not your fault. This
is how we are as mammals.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've lived on
the Earth for millennium

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:90%
where there was a food shortage.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
You're programmed to
put on fat whenever

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:90%
there is food available.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's a
lot of food available,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
but it's the wrong kind.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, we've been
programmed for millennia

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%
to store up for the winter.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.022 align:middle line:90%
But the winter doesn't come.

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Thousands of years ago
when we lived outdoors

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know where our
next meal was coming from,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
if there was a famine--
because it was a cold winter

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:84%
or whatever reason--
your body is

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
going to want to hold
extra weight to protect you

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.099 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.904 align:middle line:90%
And a famine is a stress.

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you go
through that stress,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to say,
we need an extra 10 pounds

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to protect us against famines.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>But one of the really
interesting things

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
about hunter-gatherer
people, people

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
who do a very moderate amount
of agriculture-- we could call

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
them hunter-gatherer-gardeners--
what we see in those people

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
is that they have an extremely
high amount of nutrition,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
an extremely low amount
of calories in their food

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:84%
compared to people in
modern civilization, which

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
have a very high
amount of calories

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and a very low amount of
nutrition available to them.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have so
many calorie sources.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But we still have
the same signal.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So somebody bites
into a burger or they

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:84%
take a sip off a
milkshake, and they get

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:90%
those fats and those sugars.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And their body says, yes, more.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it's used to behaving
in an environment where there's

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:90%
feast and there's famine.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we got feast
like nobody's business,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:90%
we just don't have any famine.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.354 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>You could be eating
to your heart's content,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:84%
you could eat 10,000
calories a day,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and if you're not getting
the specific nutrients

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
your body needs in a way that
they can digest and assimilate,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
then you're starving
on a nutritional basis.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.739 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're starving
on a nutritional basis,

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to
stay hungry to get

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:90%
those specific nutrients.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.359 align:middle line:84%
Now, man-made foods--
like bread and sugar

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and table salt, as
a matter of fact--

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
trick your body
into thinking you're

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
getting specific nutrients.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, your body
stays hungry for them.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.757 align:middle line:84%
But then, the cells
don't get nourished.

00:07:09.757 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the cells
aren't getting nourished,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you're starving on
a cellular level.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>So what happens for
a average person is,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
today, in our civilization, is
they are not getting enough,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
say, vitamin A. They're not
getting enough vitamin D.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not even getting enough
vitamin C. They're chronically

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:90%
starved of nutrients.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So they keep eating
and eating and eating.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But the foods that
they keep eating

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough
of these nutrients

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
for them ever to get the
stock that they need.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.479 align:middle line:84%
But what those foods do
have is a lot of calories.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
they start to pack

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
these calories onto their
body in the form of body fat.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And the body starts to
accumulate, or bio-accumulate,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
too much-- not
just fat, but also

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:84%
all of the associated pollutants
that are in that food supply.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:90%
We see things like diabetes.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We see blood sugar
imbalance issues.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And we see a lot of weight gain.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is a really
prevalent problem today.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Because people are overfed.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
starving to death.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>I was 31 when I realized,
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
take care of myself.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And I am sick.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, I had to go back
and learn all the things

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that I wish I had known
as a child, as a teenager,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:90%
as a young adult.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Step one was just going
back and understanding,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:90%
how do I take care of myself?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
What do I put in this body that
is compromised at this point?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:90%
How do I boost my immune system?

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.492 align:middle line:90%
How do I increase my longevity?

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, that comes back to
what you eat, what you drink,

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:90%
and what you think.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>From a very cursory,
surface perspective,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
what's actually happened
is is that we left farms.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We got to living in cities and
forgot about our instincts.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's led to
an obesity crisis.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's led to a crisis of
misunderstanding of what

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:90%
a natural diet includes.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.955 align:middle line:84%
And it's also left us with
a little bit of a despair

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and confusion.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what to do now.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.105 align:middle line:84%
>>The problem is that we
are not eating food anymore.

00:09:42.105 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
We are eating
food-like products.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And they are adorned.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They are made to look
better and smell better

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and be presented so that
people are attracted to them.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they
also made so that they

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.079 align:middle line:90%
can have a long shelf life.

00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the supermarket
would be losing money,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and the manufacturers as well.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So the objective is
not really to give you

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
a healthy product-- is to give
you a product that will make

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
you buy it, that will
last long, and that

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.445 align:middle line:84%
will be make a lot of
profit for the company that

00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:18.413 align:middle line:90%
is producing it, right.

00:10:18.413 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Ugh.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:90%
9:15, could be worse.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, it's worse.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's Jason.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.706 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi there.

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:45.205 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.445 align:middle line:90%
>>Your hair looks nice today.

00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>He likes my hair.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.707 align:middle line:90%
What about every other day?

00:10:55.707 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:90%
He's looking at you.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Quick, say something!

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks, you too.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.529 align:middle line:84%
>>We've got this
processed junk-food diet

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:90%
that people are on.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's also combined
with this relatively new

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.195 align:middle line:90%
indoor lifestyle.

00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, our bodies
were not designed

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
to sit at desks under
fluorescent lights in an office

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
cubicle and chow down
processed junk food all day

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:90%
long without getting exercise.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And, if you do just one of these
things, it may not be so bad.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But by combining them both,
then you end up with a disaster.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You've got way too many
calories, not enough nutrients,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and not enough use
of those categories.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>And those particular factors,
when combined together,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
create an obesity epidemic.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
They create a
low-energy epidemic.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:90%
They create a fog in cognition.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
They create an environment where
people begin to lose the will

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
to take self-responsibility.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So then, they turn it all over
to a doctor whose only able

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to prescribe a
pharmaceutical pill which

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't address the
real symptoms, which

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.555 align:middle line:90%
are varied and complex.

00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>For me, the biggest
cause of obesity, bar none,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:90%
is addiction.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But to understand the level
of addiction that we've got

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.449 align:middle line:90%
might be challenging for some.

00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, people
can understand the addiction

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:90%
to cigarettes.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Because that has
now been proven.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.045 align:middle line:84%
They can understand the
addiction to alcohol.

00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
But with food, people say,
look, I can stop eating.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, like
the tobacco companies--

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
if you go back in the
late '60s, early '70s--

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:12.667 align:middle line:84%
and they knowingly added more
nicotine to cigarettes in order

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:13.625 align:middle line:90%
to make them addictive.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I used to smoke 40,
60 cigarettes a day.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Why did I?

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.312 align:middle line:84%
One cigarettes led
to a chain reaction

00:13:24.312 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that then led to another one,
and another one, another one.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I say to people,
look, the reason why

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I smoke is because I enjoy it.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Because I love it.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But I would hit my
head on the pillow,

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
praying I would wake up and
become a non-smoker every day.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Every smoker on Earth would
love to not want cigarettes

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:90%
if they could.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:84%
There is an invisible
prison, if you will,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.769 align:middle line:84%
that captures people
in the nicotine trap.

00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
The need for a cigarette is
only cause by the last one.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have a cigarette,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
nicotine goes in your system.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Nicotine has to get out of
your system, or you will die.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
When somebody has a
cigarette, after they're

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
withdrawing from nicotine,
it replaces the nicotine back

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:90%
into their bloodstream.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And they feel better.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But that's like putting
on a pair of tight shoes

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to get the pleasure
of taking them off.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
cigarettes are addictive

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is much in the same way that
certain foods are addictive.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
They know why they
shouldn't do it.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But they have no idea
why they are doing it.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>The food companies
engineer addictions,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe, into
many of the foods.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.555 align:middle line:84%
>>The food industry is
multi-billions-- tens

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
of billions of
dollars-- and they

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
have the wherewithal and
the science resources

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.560 align:middle line:84%
to really identify very
carefully what appeals

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:90%
to the average consumer.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of that, they can

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
use these chemical derivatives
to create these concoctions,

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.169 align:middle line:84%
which really taste
quite good and can

00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:51.335 align:middle line:90%
have an addictive component.

00:14:51.335 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MSG is in 80% of
all flavored foods

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that you get at a
restaurant, that you

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:90%
get at a grocery store.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:90%
It makes you want to eat more.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.012 align:middle line:84%
But it does something
else-- it actually

00:15:19.012 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
excites a part of
your brain that's

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:90%
in charge of the fat programs.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The chemical of MSG
excites the brain.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.274 align:middle line:84%
And due to that excitation, your
body activates the fat programs

00:15:31.274 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and gets fatter.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And everybody knows this.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.245 align:middle line:90%
Like, scientists know this.

00:15:37.245 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows this.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.582 align:middle line:90%
And no one's saying anything.

00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
How do I know
everybody knows this?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.705 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you want
to study obesity

00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
study a fact mouse,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:90%
you've got to make a mouse fat.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Because mice aren't fat.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So the way you make a mouse
fat is you feed him MSG.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's even a term for
it, MSG obesity induced mice.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
If you do a search for
MSG obesity induced mice,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll see tons of
research reports

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.842 align:middle line:84%
where they talk about,
well, the protocol

00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
was we made the mouse fat,
feeding him this much MSG.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, we studied this,
this, this, and the other thing.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:90%
They're not studying that.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Just, that's the
protocol for making

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:90%
a mouse fat is feeding him MSG.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is in 80%
of modern day foods.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:32.612 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.612 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>A food, let's say a processed,
refined-sugar food or a soda,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
it will deliver something,
a biochemical change

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It will make you momentarily
uplifted or momentarily happy.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And people get used
to that feeling.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And they want to slam
cookies or cake or soda

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to get that momentary
feeling of feeling elated.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But then, that feeling
very quickly drops off.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.395 align:middle line:90%
And you're left empty.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, where's the food?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Where's the nutrients?

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
Where are the things that the
body and the mind really crave?

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.984 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, from the food
companies' point of view,

00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
is to go back and
buy another can.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.376 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
>>If I was in the food industry,
what am I looking to do?

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:90%
I want to sell you more food.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:90%
That's all I want to do.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, how can I do that?

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I can manipulate the chemical
structure of their food

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
so that, now, it becomes
not fulfilling, but empty--

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.512 align:middle line:84%
but gives the impression when
they very first ingest it,

00:17:37.512 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that it is the most fulfilling
thing they've ever had.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Nothing else does it in your
brain quite like a diet cola.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there's
a deadly combination there

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:90%
of aspartame and caffeine.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And those two together
create a very unique blend

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of excitotoxin that
kills off brain cells.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But before they die,
they have this excitement

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
that's like a buzz.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So what you find with
the diet cola addicts

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
is that they'll
drink, sometimes,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:90%
a liter, two liters a day.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
women do it as a way

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:90%
to keep their weight down.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They just have the next
buzz of diet colas.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Aspartame causes formaldehyde
build-up in the brain.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:84%
It causes frontal
lobe inflammation.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Migraines can be a common
one, visual disturbances.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.271 align:middle line:84%
>>Symptoms that mimic
multiple sclerosis.

00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:90%
There's headaches.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.640 align:middle line:90%
There's neurologic problems.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>--Seizures in
more serious cases.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>--Cognitive problems.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And can, in fact, lead to
different types of cancer.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Actually, as most
pilots are aware,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
they can't drink diet sodas.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.949 align:middle line:84%
Because it's well-recognized
within the pilot association

00:19:02.949 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:90%
that you just don't drink this.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it can really
cause severe aberrations

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to your vision that
will potentially

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
lead to problems
with your flying.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>If you look at
the studies that

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
examined the toxicity of
aspartame done by Dr. Walton,

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of the 90 studies that were
done that showed that there was

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
no side effects from
aspartame, over 90% of those

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%
were funded by industry.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have almost the
same number of other studies

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that were independently
funded finding

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
the exact reverse, 90% of
them showing problems with it.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:45.112 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.112 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Some of the
artificial sweeteners

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
have been proven, not
only to have horrific side

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
effects over a
long period of use,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
but they cause
carbohydrate cravings.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.957 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody
has a diet drink

00:19:55.957 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're wondering why
they're not getting thin

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and why they're craving
even more carbohydrates,

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
it's because those substances
have been very, very carefully

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:90%
designed, not to help you.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.820 align:middle line:84%
They're into just
selling and marketing.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>So yeah, there's zero
calories in diet soda.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But studies have shown that
if you drink diet soda,

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
within a couple
of years, you will

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.691 align:middle line:84%
be fatter than when you first
started drinking the diet soda.

00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Unfortunately, when a food
additive, like aspartame

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
or any artificial
sweetener is manufactured,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:84%
the process of getting
approval is really

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that the manufacturer--
the company that's

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:84%
making it-- is the one
the funds the studies.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
studies that are

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
submitted to the regulatory
agency to provide approval.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's not this independent,
third-party, objective

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:84%
evaluation that's being done,
like most people's impression.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
believe the FDA actually

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
has their own scientists
that do this analysis.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It basically
evaluates the studies

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that the industry
submits that they funded.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>So we know that
the food companies

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
realize that many of their
ingredients are very addictive.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the tobacco
companies did it for decades.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They're still doing it.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
If you addict a customer,
you have a customer for life.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Food companies do much the same
thing with different chemicals.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not nicotine.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the MSG.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the processed sugars.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.005 align:middle line:90%
It's the aspartame.

00:21:35.005 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It's these other chemicals.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same idea.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
selling cigarettes.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:84%
You're selling food
that's harmful,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and you want people
to keep coming back.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.384 align:middle line:84%
So you put in those
chemicals that make

00:21:46.384 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
them want it again and again.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>The marketing,
essentially, lies to you.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it presents you with
this image of a can of soda,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't tell
you what's in the can.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
What it says is that this
can, if you drink it,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
it's going to bring you these
benefits by association.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be cool.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.029 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be sexy.

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be happy.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be surrounded by
friends, wearing skimpy bikinis

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:84%
or whatever their
message happens to be.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:90%
This is a lie.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, if you
drink that soda, you're

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
going to lose bone
mineral density,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:84%
because of the phosphoric
acid it contains.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
If it's a diet soda, you may
suffer neurological problems

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:90%
due to the chemical sweeteners.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not a
diet soda, it probably

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:84%
is made with high fructose
corn syrup in North America

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:90%
and elsewhere around the world.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
promote diabetes,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:90%
type two, and obesity.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand,
here's the promise.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be sexy
and popular and cool.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
you're going to be

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
obese and miserable
and unhealthy and sick.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The marketers are
telling you this.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:90%
But what they deliver is this.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>We are now coming to a
point where we are wary,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
more and more people are
wary about just falling

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
into this marketing of zero
calories, no fat, no sugar,

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:90%
types of messages.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of the food labels
at the grocery store

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:90%
are very deceptive.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
a cereal made

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:84%
by General Mills called Total,
Blueberry Pomegranate cereal.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It contains no blueberries
and no pomegranates.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You might wonder, well, how
do they come up with the name?

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And the naming of food
products often is a little

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:90%
too loose and creative.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they're
naming these products--

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and this is from the major
food companies whose products

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are in every major grocery store
all around the world-- it's

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
almost as if their naming
them based on what they hope

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:84%
you might imagine
you're eating, rather

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:90%
than what's really in the box.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times,
it's not in there.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there's stuff that
is in there that they don't

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
want you to see on the label.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So they don't put
it on the label,

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:90%
such as propylene glycol.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
This chemical is used in a
lot of blueberry muffins.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what makes
up the blueberry bits that

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:90%
aren't blueberries.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
They're made of propylene
glycol, partially hydrogenated

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
oils, liquid sugars,
and artificial colors.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:84%
You can also use propylene
glycol to winterize your RV.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It prevents the pipes from
freezing in the winter.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's also used to clean out
your colon before a colonoscopy.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.482 align:middle line:84%
So multiple uses for this
ingredient that you're get

00:24:35.482 --> 00:24:36.565 align:middle line:90%
in your blueberry muffins.

00:24:36.565 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>America loves enemies.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And America chooses an enemy
and deploys all its forces

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:90%
against it, right?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So at some point,
when we were noticing

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:57.775 align:middle line:84%
that we were getting fat as
a population, we attacked.

00:24:57.775 --> 00:24:59.550 align:middle line:90%
The enemy was fat.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And everything became
fat-free, fat-free this

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:90%
and fat-free that.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And the calories that
fat were occupying

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:84%
were replaced by,
mostly, carbohydrates.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
That resulted in the fattest
country in the world.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Fat-free normally means
it's loaded with sugar.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.535 align:middle line:84%
I can get a two pound bag
of sugar in my hand now.

00:25:28.535 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can put a label
that says, 100% fat-free.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
The fact that once
the sugar is ingested

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:84%
will turn into fat in
the body-- because why?

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it sends the
sugar levels sky high.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And what does the pancreas do?

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It has to secrete
insulin in order

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to bring that down
so you don't die.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Insulin is the
fat-producing hormone.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So the 2 pound bag
of sugar that I

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:84%
put 100% fat-free,
although factually correct,

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievably misleading.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So all this excess energy
comes along and says,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:90%
where can we store it?

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.159 align:middle line:90%
Short-term places-- liver.

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.575 align:middle line:84%
But what do we do
with the excess?

00:26:06.575 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I know what we'll do.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll produce some fat
cells, store them in there,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
use them later.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, there's
never a later.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.919 align:middle line:84%
>>Fat is really good for you
if it's the right kind of fat.

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It's getting the right
kind of fat in your body.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're on a low-fat
diet of some kind,

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.051 align:middle line:90%
you're constantly hungry.

00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you need the correct
fats and proteins to feel

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:90%
satiated.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, if you
negate that side of what

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the body is crying
out for, you'll

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:90%
be constantly looking for it.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>We know that the
cheap, low-grade fats--

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
such as soybean oil and even
canola oil and the corn oils--

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
are not healthy for you to
consume in large quantities

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:90%
over the long-term.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The worst kinds of fats are the
partially hydrogenated fats.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:84%
These are the
hydrogenated oils that

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:84%
are used in many baked items
and crackers and cookies

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.985 align:middle line:90%
and margarine spreads.

00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, the butter spreads?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.129 align:middle line:84%
Oh, those are some of the worst
foods you could possibly eat.

00:27:02.129 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
If you want healthy
fats, then you've

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
got to get into the natural,
plant-based fats from avocados,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and chia seeds, and
flax seeds, and even

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:90%
healthy fat from salmon.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.663 align:middle line:84%
Wild caught salmon, that's
a healthy fat for you.

00:27:16.663 --> 00:27:19.252 align:middle line:90%
>>[LAUGHS] You want a bite?

00:27:19.252 --> 00:27:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>I thought you loved me.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>I do.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.725 align:middle line:90%
Take two bites.

00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:24.095 align:middle line:84%
>>No, it's got high
fructose corn syrup in it.

00:27:24.095 --> 00:27:24.595 align:middle line:90%
>>So?

00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you know what
they say about it?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>That it's--

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>When it comes to high fructose
corn syrup, a lot of people

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
don't realize the dangers of
refining and concentrating

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:90%
ingredients from a product.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>In the '70s, a
Japanese scientist

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:84%
developed the technology
to separate fructose

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:84%
from corn, thus
radically reducing

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:84%
the cost of this
high fructose corn

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:84%
syrup relative to
traditional forms of sugar.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>So high fructose corn syrup
comes from corn, obviously.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's not natural.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so
concentrated and so refined.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an isolated nutrient.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, cocaine is probably
not good for your health.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:90%
But it comes from the coca leaf.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And coca leaf tea is perfectly
safe for your health.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I drank it when I was hiking
in the Andes Mountains.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's used throughout
the culture there.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
nutraceutical,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
medicinal plant that's used
throughout South America.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's no harm
in drinking coca tea.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's not addictive,
nothing like that.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't want to
snort cocaine from the highly

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:90%
refined coca tea.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, eating high fructose
corn syrup, in my view,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:90%
is a lot like snorting cocaine.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
It is the highly refined,
isolated, concentrated,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
chemically manipulated
version of something

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that's found in corn
and grown in corn.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>It's very similar to
what white sugar is.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
White sugar is the purified
sucrose extracted out of, say,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
beets or sugar cane.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a pharmaceutical sugar.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, white flour is a
pharmaceutical carbohydrate,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that
cocaine is extracted out

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:90%
of the coca plant.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have the native
cocaine in the matrix

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
of the plant itself, or you
have the pharmaceutical version.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:84%
To me, white sugar,
cocaine, white flour,

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
they all fall in
the same category

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of a whitened, extracted,
purified substance that's

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:90%
drawn out of the plant kingdom.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.100 align:middle line:84%
All of them create
imbalances in the body

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:90%
and lead to a host of problems.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.302 align:middle line:84%
>>But if you eat
corn, it's fine.

00:29:27.302 --> 00:29:29.760 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get that
much high fructose corn syrup.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>The number one source of
calories in the United States

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:90%
is fructose.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And fructose is
highly addictive.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
In the 1900s, the average
person was exposed

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:90%
to about 15 grams of fructose.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And the fructose, another
term for that is fruit sugar.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's why
most fruits are sweet.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And fructose in small
amounts-- 15, 25

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
grams, which is less
than an ounce a day--

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is probably OK and healthy.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:84%
But the average person is
consuming 70 to 80 grams a day.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are many kids,
primarily teenagers,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
who are taking 120, 150
grams of fructose a day,

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:84%
literally 10 times the amount
they were taking a century ago.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you abuse
that type of sugar

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and you have that
exposure, it has

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.602 align:middle line:84%
some very severe
metabolic consequences

00:30:17.602 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that can lead to these
addictive process,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and change brain
chemistry, and really make

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:84%
it very difficult to
get out of this cycle

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:84%
where you have
these food cravings,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and really addicted
to food that's

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.740 align:middle line:90%
not going to make you healthy.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>And in terms of just
the glycemic index,

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.215 align:middle line:84%
high fructose corn syrup is
like jet fuel for your body.

00:30:38.215 --> 00:30:42.746 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you pour jet fuel
into your car's gasoline tank,

00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
ruin your engine.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll burn it out.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Much the same thing
happens in the human body.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:84%
You can find high fructose
corn syrup in so many products

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
in the stores, it
would amaze you.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
If you turn them around and
looked at the ingredients,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:84%
you'd say, no way, I can't
believe it's in here.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Salad dressings will have it.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll have high fructose corn
syrup in, like, pasta sauces.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And pizza sauce especially,
is loaded with it.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You really have to watch out
for everything in the grocery

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Read it.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it doesn't contain
this high fructose corn

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:84%
syrup and other ingredients
that are dangerous.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from the isolates.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from high
fructose corn syrup.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from anything that
is an unnatural and highly

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
concentrated chemical
from a plant that

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
should be consumed
in its full spectrum,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:84%
bio-available,
nutrient complexity.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the way nature delivers
food, as a nutrient complex,

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:39.309 align:middle line:90%
not as one isolated nutrient.

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important realizations

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that people need to get on
to here when they're eating

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
is that the breads and any of
these fluffy carbohydrates,

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:84%
they're converted into
sugar right in your body.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.965 align:middle line:84%
So within minutes after you
eat them, they become sugar.

00:32:02.965 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
say, well, I'm

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.756 align:middle line:84%
avoiding sugar
because they're not

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:84%
eating crystallized
sugar in that form

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:90%
or drinking liquid sugar.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:90%
But they're eating a bread.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Or they're eating a pancake
or a muffin or a cornbread.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Cornbread used to be made
out of corn and not sugar.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.545 align:middle line:90%
Now it's like corn cake.

00:32:18.545 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's sugarized corn cake.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that, that
becomes sugar internally

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and has a very high glycemic
index and a high glycemic load.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.967 align:middle line:90%
[TYPING]

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:29.963 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm just going to lunch.

00:32:29.963 --> 00:32:35.452 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.452 --> 00:32:37.448 align:middle line:90%
[TYPING]

00:32:37.448 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.418 align:middle line:90%
[TYPING]

00:32:52.418 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you're thinking
about what to eat,

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:84%
if you're working to
reduce your sugars,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.300 align:middle line:84%
your definition of "what is
sugar" really needs to expand.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just
the white powder.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:12.471 align:middle line:84%
>>It's breads, pasta, cereal,
rice, potatoes, corn, waffles,

00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:90%
pancakes.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, pretty much
any food for breakfast

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:90%
that most people eat.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>In America, we're
eating about 150 pounds

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:90%
of sugar per year, each person.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
79 pounds of high
fructose corn syrup.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.790 align:middle line:84%
That's about 22
teaspoons of sugar a day.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's nothing
moderate about that.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Sugar is in everything,
everything from cough syrup

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:90%
to crackers to sushi.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's very hard to avoid.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The more sugar that
we're consuming,

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.020 align:middle line:84%
the more chronic disease
we're experiencing

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and also these incredible ups
and downs and mood swings.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Because what sugar
does is it increases

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:90%
beta-endorphin in the brain.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's a feel
good, natural opiate,

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:90%
morphine-like substance.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you're depressed
or you're under stress,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:84%
you want to eat-- what do we
call them?-- comfort foods--

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:84%
macaroni and cheese-- all
the foods that have a virtual

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:84%
delivery system of sugar
right into body fat.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:84%
So it is not fat
that makes you fat.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's sugar that makes you fat.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is very easy and
cheap to produce foods

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.845 align:middle line:90%
that become sugar quickly.

00:34:29.845 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>You think of something
like a croissant.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
Many people I know that
just say, you know,

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.544 align:middle line:90%
I've gone on a sugar-free diet.

00:34:35.544 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And I see them
eating a croissant.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.961 align:middle line:90%
And I say, that's sugar!

00:34:37.961 --> 00:34:39.501 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is going to happen?

00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it enters the
bloodstream, that is sugar.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>What we're really talking
about is getting that hit,

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:84%
getting that sugar high,
getting that beta-endorphin rush

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that people are looking
for to soothe themselves

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.060 align:middle line:90%
when they are under stress.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But once you understand
that sugar is a drug,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:90%
just like alcohol is a drug!

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens with
any addiction is this,

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
you become habituated
to the effect.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you need
more and more and more over

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
time to give you
the same effect.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.300 align:middle line:84%
It's no different
than it is with sugar.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>We know the problems
caused by something

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.112 align:middle line:90%
like purified cocaine.

00:35:22.112 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:90%
We know that causes problems.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.330 align:middle line:84%
We're comfortable with
referring to that as a drug.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.720 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming culturally
more comfortable

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:84%
with recognizing
white sugar as a drug.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
starting to understand how

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:90%
addictive a substance it is.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, if you walk the aisles
in the average grocery store

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the amount of
sugar in a child's breakfast

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:84%
cereal, you might as well be
rolling up the kid's sleeve

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.594 align:middle line:90%
and putting in heroin.

00:35:48.594 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Because it's the same.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Milk ain't good
enough anymore.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.589 align:middle line:84%
Because someone at
the milk boards,

00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:59.879 align:middle line:90%
right-- and don't get me wrong.

00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I support milk.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But someone at the milk board
probably paid a lot of money

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.484 align:middle line:84%
for some geezer to work out that
if you put loads of flavorings

00:36:05.484 --> 00:36:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and colorings and sugar in milk,
right, more kids will drink it.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
For me, there ain't no
need to flavor the milk.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's sugar in everything.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.305 align:middle line:84%
I know the ins and outs
of those ingredients.

00:36:16.305 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
It's in everything.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern day problems.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.390 align:middle line:90%
There's our milk.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.322 align:middle line:90%
There's our carton.

00:36:23.322 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:84%
In that is nearly as much sugar
as one of your favorite cans

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:90%
of fizzy pop.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And they're having two a day.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:90%
So let me just show you.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:38.315 align:middle line:84%
We've got one kid here
having eight tablespoons

00:36:38.315 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:90%
of sugar a day.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's your week.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:90%
There's your month.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've took the
liberty of putting

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:84%
in just the five years of
elementary school sugar,

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.615 align:middle line:90%
just from milk.

00:36:55.615 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
about you guys,

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
but judging the circumstances,
any judge in the whole world

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.780 align:middle line:84%
would look at the
statistics and the evidence,

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and they would find any
government of old guilty

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:90%
of child abuse.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.510 align:middle line:90%
That's my belief.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.270 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>The challenge we have with
food or, in particular, sugar

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is because it's illegal to
give a child a cigarette.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And so it should be.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It is illegal to
give a child alcohol.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not illegal to give a child
white refined sugar or refined

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.430 align:middle line:90%
fats.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Food, as far as I'm
concerned, kills more people

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
than all drugs on
Earth combined.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, to go back to the
beginning, people know this.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So why are highly intelligent
people not stopping?

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't know
the nature of the trap.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I used to be so addicted to
sugar that I would literally

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:84%
throw my food out and
dig through the garbage.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go get ice cream and
Ben and Jerry's and doughnuts

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.349 align:middle line:90%
and-- I'd have a pig-out fest.

00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would have to throw
my food in the garbage.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, I got to point where
I would dig through the garbage

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.055 align:middle line:90%
and get the sugar.

00:38:01.055 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, I got to a
point where the only way

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.346 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't dig
through the garbage

00:38:04.346 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:90%
was to spray it with Windex.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So you tell me that that's
healthy and in balance.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, we think about--
"woo!" --cocaine, heroin,

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:90%
all these big drugs.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
that premature death

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is coming from sugar and
alcohol and smoking, of course.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you begin to think about
these massive doses of sugar

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:84%
as no different from
drugs and alcohol,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.571 align:middle line:84%
then you get a handle
on the situation.

00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey everyone, welcome back.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like to introduce
you to a special guest I have

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.975 align:middle line:84%
with me in the studio,
Harvey Diamond, health

00:38:39.975 --> 00:38:42.100 align:middle line:84%
guru and the author
of "Fit for Life."

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Harvey is here to talk
to us about something

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:84%
he is very passionate
about, dieting.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Harvey, tell us what
you think about diets.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>So many people want to know
about diets, because people

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:90%
are going to try them.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.470 align:middle line:90%
But they don't work.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.681 align:middle line:84%
The first chapter of the
first book I ever wrote

00:38:58.681 --> 00:38:59.930 align:middle line:90%
was called "Diets Don't Work."

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:90%
It's because they're temporary.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing is taking
one of the food categories

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that we must have to
live-- that's protein, fat,

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.615 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrate-- and one
of those is eliminated.

00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, some weight
will be lost temporarily.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But let me ask you
something, do you

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:90%
want to be healthy temporarily?

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But you want to lose
weight temporarily.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
They have failure
built right into them.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:29.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done at
UCLA once that said 90 to 95%

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:84%
of the people who go
on a diet will not only

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.330 align:middle line:84%
gain that weight back,
they will add more weight.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.611 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so happy to
be eating again that they

00:39:38.611 --> 00:39:39.610 align:middle line:90%
don't eat intelligently.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:40:10.587 align:middle line:90%


00:40:10.587 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>You can lose weight on a diet.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little bit
like borrowing from Peter

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.750 align:middle line:90%
to pay Paul.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can get 10
pounds off your body

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.854 align:middle line:90%
through sheer force.

00:40:18.854 --> 00:40:21.103 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have to
pay it back with interest.

00:40:21.103 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:90%
You'll pay back with 15 pounds.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Because every time you force
yourself to lose weight,

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:84%
your body is going to want to
have extra weight to protect

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.850 align:middle line:90%
you from a perceived famine.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And I lived through this, where
I lose 10 pounds, gain 15,

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:38.900 align:middle line:84%
lose 10 pounds, gain 15, until
I had gained over 200 pounds.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I tried
every diet besides meeting

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.000 align:middle line:84%
face-to-face with Atkins,
going to a Pritikin--

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I had naturopaths,
homeopaths, acupuncture.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.817 align:middle line:84%
I had these seeds taped to
my ear from an acupuncturist.

00:40:48.817 --> 00:40:51.025 align:middle line:84%
And they're supposed to be
like an acupressure point.

00:40:51.025 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So every time you're hungry,
you're supposed to press them.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd walk through the
streets of New York.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.305 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'd smell pizza, I'd
sit there and press these seeds

00:40:57.305 --> 00:40:58.440 align:middle line:90%
in my ear.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.570 align:middle line:90%
This is what I lived with.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And I really did work at it.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, people think that
overweight people are just

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:84%
weak and lazy and
over-indulgent.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very disciplined person.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But when my body
wanted to be fat,

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I could not lose the weight.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>I think we are barking
up the wrong tree.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:84%
People are looking for a
result that is superficial.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
just to look good.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really consider
that that could be done

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.440 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out, right?

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So people go into diets
and all these fads

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.850 align:middle line:84%
in order to lose weight
and lose weight fast.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is just not
the way to approach it.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:90%
The results prove it.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>We're violating our
bodies' basic survival laws

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.510 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The whole dieting
paradigm is flawed.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And every diet comes
out-- every week

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a new diet,
based on the same idea

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that you can somehow force
yourself to lose weight.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's flawed.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a fundamental
flaw that every time you

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.910 align:middle line:84%
force yourself to
lose weight, your body

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:90%
will force you gain weight.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think what happens
is we set ourselves up

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.060 align:middle line:84%
for failure because,
yes, you can manipulate

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.670 align:middle line:90%
the ratios of calories.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.550 align:middle line:84%
You can manipulate
the ratio of fat

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to protein to
carbohydrate infinitely.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.710 align:middle line:84%
We keep seeing all
these variations.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So I remember the high
carbohydrate, low fat.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's
switched to, well,

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.142 align:middle line:84%
let's go high protein,
low carbohydrate.

00:42:28.142 --> 00:42:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's switched to high
fat, moderate carbohydrate.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps switching around.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things have an effect.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.531 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're doing
is restricting calories

00:42:35.531 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:84%
from people, or you're
manipulating the way

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:90%
their metabolism works.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's why the Atkins
diet was so miserable for me.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.961 align:middle line:84%
Because I was so addicted to
carbs, to what I call now,

00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:90%
"dead food."

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I was so addicted to that.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.464 align:middle line:84%
To try to go off that,
at the end of the day,

00:42:49.464 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:90%
it was just miserable.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I used to do
is I used to swap diets.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the Atkins
diet is a zero carbs.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Pritikin
diet is all carbs.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:05.934 align:middle line:84%
So my wife used to joke with me
that I was on the Atkins diet

00:43:05.934 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:84%
during the day and the
Pritikin diet at night.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd come home
at the end of the day,

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and I just couldn't take going
a whole day without carbs.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I had to have bread.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>The definition of
a diet is the foods

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that a organism habitually
eats to sustain itself.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about is a real diet,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
what a species eats.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.512 align:middle line:84%
When we get onto
our real diet, we

00:43:28.512 --> 00:43:30.470 align:middle line:84%
don't have to think about
these things anymore.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to eat
from that suite of foods that

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
exist in the
supermarket, we're going

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.650 align:middle line:90%
to constantly have problems.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:36.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to constantly
have to monitor ourselves.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.764 align:middle line:84%
Because these
foods make you fat.

00:43:37.764 --> 00:43:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we look
around the world, we

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:84%
see human beings have been able
to inhabit the whole globe.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And they've been able to do it
on a host of different foods,

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.880 align:middle line:84%
from the extreme Arctic where
people ate almost exclusively

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.350 align:middle line:84%
animal fat and muscle
and organ meats,

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to the jungle where
people had access

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to far more fruits and
far more plant material.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We see people thriving and
people staying lean and healthy

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and avoiding
degenerative disease

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and not putting on
all that extra weight,

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:90%
almost no matter what they eat.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are eating a diet
that no longer resembles that.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like,
if we lived in a zoo.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.572 align:middle line:84%
If you put a human
being in a zoo the way

00:44:13.572 --> 00:44:16.030 align:middle line:84%
you put a chimpanzee in a zoo,
well, the question would be,

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.613 align:middle line:84%
what do we feed that
human in the zoo?

00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't feed chimpanzees
in zoos Captain Crunch cereal,

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.519 align:middle line:90%
Twinkies, and doughnuts.

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We feed them a diet that
looks like the diet they

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.700 align:middle line:90%
eat in their ecosystem.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.720 align:middle line:84%
We sort of live in a
zoo-like environment now.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.657 align:middle line:84%
We live in this
artificial environment.

00:44:30.657 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we're not
feeding ourselves the foods

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.480 align:middle line:90%
we're biologically adapted to.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>If you cut down on
any food, regardless

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.260 align:middle line:84%
of what the food is, if
you say, as for Monday--

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.200 align:middle line:90%
it's always a Monday.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is always going
on a diet on a Monday.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
They tend to consume
enormous amounts of food

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:90%
from Friday to the Sunday.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.736 align:middle line:84%
Sunday, they tend
to go shopping.

00:44:50.736 --> 00:44:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And they put in stuff that
they wouldn't ordinarily

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:84%
have ever put in, fruits and
vegetables, as an example.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, because I've
been on a million diets.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, when
I went on those diets

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was overweight
myself, I would

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:84%
arrive at the check-out on the
day before my diet would begin.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I had so much healthy stuff.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.826 align:middle line:90%
I'd be so proud of my trolley.

00:45:10.826 --> 00:45:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'd want the check-out
person to say something.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Look, this isn't ordinary!

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Look at how much fruit
and veg I've got!

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I would then start on
the Monday morning.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would immediately
start to feel deprived.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.144 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I could have gone
sometimes till 2 o'clock

00:45:25.144 --> 00:45:26.560 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon
not even thinking

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.730 align:middle line:84%
about food when I
wasn't on a diet,

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:84%
without consuming
any food sometimes.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd grab some water
or sometimes nothing.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't thought about it.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But the very second I told my
brain that I was on a diet,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I went into the mode of "can't."

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
If you go through-- I want
that, but I can't have it,

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to I can have it,
but I don't want it.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a massive
paradigm shift.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Don't turn it into a diet.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Keep the focus always on adding.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
types of foods we need

00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.980 align:middle line:84%
are foods that
were not man-made.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Because man-made foods our body
doesn't know how to process,

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.120 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know how to digest.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.370 align:middle line:90%
And it causes hormonal chaos.

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It causes us to gain weight.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.947 align:middle line:84%
>>The best strategy we've got is
to just add in the good stuff.

00:46:10.947 --> 00:46:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it's going to
crowd out the bad stuff.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And that works for everybody.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes everything so simple.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It completely deactivates
all the mental neuroses

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.960 align:middle line:84%
we have about diets
and what we have to eat

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's just add in the cucumbers.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's add in the apples.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>The simple foods, the plant
foods, the fruits, the nuts,

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the seeds, the vegetables, the
animal foods of high quality--

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.210 align:middle line:84%
start looking at the foods in
your house and asking yourself,

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:43.420 align:middle line:84%
could I replace this food
with a well-grown local option

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.520 align:middle line:90%
that's not as processed?

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.660 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you're
used to making pancakes out

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.560 align:middle line:84%
of white flour, can you go to
a farm locally that produces

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.940 align:middle line:90%
flour and stone grinds it?

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you find that?

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
If you look in your fridge,
and you've got milk in there.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's
processed milk.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's got the
growth hormone in it.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's
pesticide laden

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and you know there's puss in it.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you find a farm locally that
can produce that food for you

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.480 align:middle line:90%
the way people used to get it?

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If you've got the
bananas in your house

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:84%
from the supermarket,
can you replace them

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.370 align:middle line:90%
with an organic option?

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you move in a
direction that brings you

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.060 align:middle line:84%
towards the reapproximation
of your natural diet?

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:18.797 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:47:18.797 --> 00:47:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>You start adding that
in, all of a sudden,

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
all those other choices
start moving away.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Inevitably, you're going
to feel so much better

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:84%
eating the good stuff that
the choice for the bad stuff

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.370 align:middle line:90%
is no longer valid.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:38.566 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.566 --> 00:47:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>I had very bad sleep apnea.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I was borderline
type-two diabetic,

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.180 align:middle line:84%
elevated triglycerides
and cholesterol.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd worked with the
late Doctor Atkins

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:50.350 align:middle line:90%
face-to-face in New York.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And in the end,
the best thing he

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.435 align:middle line:84%
could do is yell at
me for being so fat

00:47:53.435 --> 00:47:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and because I was
killing myself.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.280 align:middle line:90%
He goes, what are you doing?

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.530 align:middle line:90%
You're killing yourself.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
you sold 200 million copies

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.000 align:middle line:90%
of your book.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.710 align:middle line:84%
You think I'm going
to lose weight

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.751 align:middle line:90%
because you're mad at me?

00:48:03.751 --> 00:48:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Is that really the
best you can do?

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.340 align:middle line:90%
So I was over 400 pounds.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And after I had that
sort of epiphany

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:17.035 align:middle line:84%
and changed my focus from diet
to finding the real reasons why

00:48:17.035 --> 00:48:22.910 align:middle line:84%
my body wanted to be fat,
I lost about 220 pounds

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.150 align:middle line:90%
over a 2 and 1/2 year period.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:90%
And that was seven years ago.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a point
where I had allowed

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:90%
myself get to 300 pounds.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And that world, as opposed
to the current world,

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.990 align:middle line:90%
is vastly different.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was overweight
and when I was sick,

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
that I was sick.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But I just felt that
life was passing me by.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Life was just not fun.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The only fun I had was watching
people on TV having fun.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a very dispiriting thing.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:25.570 align:middle line:84%
You wake up in the morning
and I was immediately aware

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:26.650 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was immediately aware
that I didn't like it.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt a little
bit like being

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:36.710 align:middle line:84%
wrapped in a blanket with
three holes in it, OK?

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:39.026 align:middle line:84%
Two to watch television
and one to eat.

00:49:39.026 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd got to this point
where I was 40 years of age,

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.295 align:middle line:84%
I was fat, sick,
and nearly dead.

00:49:45.295 --> 00:49:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I was 310 pounds or 141 kilos.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I was taking high doses
of steroids every day,

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.440 align:middle line:90%
day and night, for eight years.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I was a cheeseburger
away from a heart attack.

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.385 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no more.

00:49:59.385 --> 00:50:01.190 align:middle line:84%
You got to do something
about this, Joe.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:84%
You're not as smart as
you thought you were.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.650 align:middle line:84%
What actually happened
after that period of time

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:10.110 align:middle line:84%
was that my body gave up
to the pressure of what

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.281 align:middle line:90%
I was putting it under.

00:50:11.281 --> 00:50:13.405 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about the
pressure I was putting it

00:50:13.405 --> 00:50:15.440 align:middle line:84%
under, it was like
lack of sleep,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.560 align:middle line:84%
poor diet, too much alcohol,
smoking, no exercise.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you throw
everything in, I had it all.

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:28.542 align:middle line:90%


00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, a lot of us, we
have some healing to do.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.300 align:middle line:90%
We have recovery to do.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the world
we grew up in has

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.320 align:middle line:84%
been such a barrage
against our nervous system,

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.730 align:middle line:90%
our endocrine system.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Our health has
been under attack.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes there's going
to be a period of healing.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>We decided as a race to
experiment with chemicals.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:52.520 align:middle line:84%
We created over 75,000
synthetic chemicals since 1940.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.070 align:middle line:84%
We've released them, wholesale,
into the environment.

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:57.290 align:middle line:90%
They're in the food chain.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:90%
They're in us.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They've contaminated every
single creature on Earth.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:90%
We now have to clean up.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to actually
turn it around and decide

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to move
away from better living

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:84%
through chemistry and move
towards the idea of better

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:84%
living through working with
nature and natural laws.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>And the body has two
ways of defending itself,

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:90%
which are generic ways.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
body produces mucus

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to coat these chemicals so that
they buffer the irritation.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Or it retains and even
generates more fat.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Because as we said,
most of these chemicals

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.212 align:middle line:90%
are lipophilic or fat-loving.

00:51:42.212 --> 00:51:43.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't dissolve in water.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.560 align:middle line:90%
They dissolve in fat.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.230 align:middle line:90%
So they attach to fat.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you just sweat
it off and force the body

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.880 align:middle line:84%
into burning fat
without creating

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.420 align:middle line:84%
the conditions
for the body to be

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:84%
able to cleanse and detoxifying
and neutralize and make

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.940 align:middle line:84%
these chemicals water-soluble
so that it can be sweated

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.410 align:middle line:84%
off and peed off--
so you're burning fat

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:08.240 align:middle line:84%
but not really getting
rid of the toxins.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.456 align:middle line:84%
These toxins are left
to cause the damage

00:52:13.456 --> 00:52:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that they were not
causing because they

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.770 align:middle line:90%
were surrounded by fat.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>So as long as you're
taking in more toxins

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:21.790 align:middle line:84%
than you're
eliminating, your body's

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.020 align:middle line:90%
not going to let you burn fat.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Because burning
the fat will just

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.460 align:middle line:90%
put more toxins into your body.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have to address
the fact that you're

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.910 align:middle line:84%
being assaulted with toxins
before your body will

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:35.230 align:middle line:90%
allow you to let go of weight.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>The body only wants to heal.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.390 align:middle line:90%
It's crying out to heal.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:40.670 align:middle line:90%
That's all it wants to do.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:43.140 align:middle line:90%
It wants to naturally detoxify.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Only the body can
detoxify itself,

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:84%
providing there's no
toxicity coming in.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Probably the best thing a
person can do in the beginning

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.410 align:middle line:90%
is kind of clean themselves out.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Get on, like, a
detoxification program.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Foods that detoxifying the
body, some are really obvious

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:00.510 align:middle line:90%
and some are not.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more obvious
ones are green vegetables,

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:04.800 align:middle line:90%
chlorophyll rich foods.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.170 align:middle line:84%
In hospitals, you
know, chlorophyll

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:84%
was used as an internal
deodorant for people

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.725 align:middle line:90%
who had a lot of body odor.

00:53:11.725 --> 00:53:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Chlorophyll is a great way
to clean our bodies out.

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So those are, of course, all
of our well-grown, heirloom,

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.560 align:middle line:90%
organic vegetables.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.010 align:middle line:84%
These are fantastic for
cleaning our bodies out.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There are some less obvious
stuff as well though,

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.830 align:middle line:90%
like gelatinous plant foods.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.470 align:middle line:84%
For instance, things
like chia seeds

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:31.330 align:middle line:90%
or aloe vera or the seaweeds.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.220 align:middle line:84%
These foods that have a gel that
they secrete when they get wet.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.882 align:middle line:84%
And what those do,
those gels move

00:53:35.882 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:90%
through our intestinal tract.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.380 align:middle line:84%
If we eat something
like chia seeds,

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.357 align:middle line:84%
if we can blend that
into a drink some way

00:53:41.357 --> 00:53:43.440 align:middle line:84%
or something like that and
get it into our bodies,

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.390 align:middle line:84%
these gelatinous fibers move
through our intestinal track

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:50.420 align:middle line:84%
absorbing things, binding
them, and passing them through.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Particularly what
they do is they

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.210 align:middle line:84%
absorb the bile salts that
are released by the liver,

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:57.030 align:middle line:84%
bind those up, and
pass those out,

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and with it, all the
fat-soluble toxins

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.354 align:middle line:84%
the liver is trying
to get rid of.

00:54:00.354 --> 00:54:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we don't have
these gelatinous fibers,

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:03.710 align:middle line:84%
we tend to reabsorb
a lot of that.

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So the liver tries to get rid of
something, puts it in the bile,

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.300 align:middle line:84%
dumps it into the
small intestine,

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.320 align:middle line:84%
hoping that it eventually
gets out of us.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.710 align:middle line:90%
But it gets reabsorbed.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So gelatinous fibers
can really do a lot

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.569 align:middle line:90%
to clean out the liver.

00:54:16.569 --> 00:54:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I want to mention two other
ingredients that are especially

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:20.480 align:middle line:90%
useful for detox.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.230 align:middle line:90%
That is parsley and cilantro.

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, parsley cleanses
your entire blood supply.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And it also gives
you fresh breath.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Parsley has so much
chlorophyll that it just

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.690 align:middle line:90%
cleanses your whole system.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And cilantro binds
with heavy metals.

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people are
getting mercury especially

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.410 align:middle line:84%
through the fish
that they're eating

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.240 align:middle line:84%
or through their
dental fillings.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat cilantro,
it can bind with that

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and remove it from your
system, so the mercury

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.590 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get lodged
in your body's cells.

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And mercury, as you
know, is very toxic.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:57.307 align:middle line:90%
It's a neurotoxin.

00:54:57.307 --> 00:54:59.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't want that anywhere
in your brain cells, right?

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>But cleansing our
bodies is not complicated.

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult.
It's just going

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.645 align:middle line:84%
to require high-quality
green plant food.

00:55:05.645 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It's going to require
gelatinous fibers.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.541 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
require good water.

00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It's going to mean
needing good air.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to mean
getting sunlight.

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.019 align:middle line:84%
And our body wants
to cleanse itself.

00:55:15.019 --> 00:55:16.310 align:middle line:90%
It's looking to cleanse itself.

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:17.601 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to cleanse itself.

00:55:17.601 --> 00:55:19.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to
really do very much.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Just input gentle foods.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Be out in nature.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And your body will cleanse
itself very easily.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And when the weight
starts coming off,

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:84%
people become so excited
they don't want to stop.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, starting
to add more and more foods back

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:35.530 align:middle line:84%
in from healthy sources
that look like the foods

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:38.470 align:middle line:84%
they used to eat
but are actually

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.920 align:middle line:84%
more satisfying and
more nutritive--

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and they'll find that
they can live a life

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.935 align:middle line:84%
not just being fit
and trim but actually

00:55:46.935 --> 00:55:48.310 align:middle line:84%
feeling how they've
always wanted

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:50.409 align:middle line:84%
to feel in a body
that works properly

00:55:50.409 --> 00:55:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and that stays healthy forever.

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:56.790 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>For me, it's back to nature
and it's back to the garden,

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And if it's made in the
garden, then I eat it.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:07.815 align:middle line:84%
If it's made in a lab,
it takes a lab to digest.

00:56:07.815 --> 00:56:11.510 align:middle line:84%
If it has a shelf-life longer
than me, I don't eat it.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just common sense.

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The simpler I get,
the healthier I get.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>So as you seek to
improve your health,

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:23.570 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want to include
certain types of foods, classes

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of foods that are
typically ignored

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.000 align:middle line:90%
in the American culture.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is not controversial.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:84%
The most conservative
nutritionist

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:35.019 align:middle line:84%
will recommend that we need
six to eight servings of fruits

00:56:35.019 --> 00:56:36.060 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables, they say.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.685 align:middle line:84%
But I always like to
twist that around.

00:56:37.685 --> 00:56:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It should be
vegetables and fruits.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Because vegetables are really
the most beneficial food group

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:90%
that we can have access to.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
not getting enough.

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.290 align:middle line:90%
They just aren't.

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you need a lot
of good vegetables.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they're full of the
full range of phytonutrients

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and antioxidants and everything
you need to stay healthy.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the ways that I
cheat this-- because, you know,

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:04.020 align:middle line:84%
getting vegetables
is a challenge--

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.950 align:middle line:90%
is that I do vegetable juicing.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'll typically
buy, I don't know,

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.340 align:middle line:84%
20 pounds of vegetables
a week, maybe more

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and juice a few pounds a day.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, a quart of
dark green vegetable juice

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that consists of-- as a base, I
like the celery and cucumbers.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, I add the dark,
deep green, leafy vegetables

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:25.861 align:middle line:90%
like kale or collards.

00:57:25.861 --> 00:57:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of
different types of kale.

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Those are the two big ones.

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But then, you can also use
other dark green vegetables.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Juicing is important
for two main reasons.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.639 align:middle line:84%
People often say to me, well
look, why don't we just eat it?

00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:39.180 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
question, first of all.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we just eat it?

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:41.039 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:57:41.039 --> 00:57:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing to address.

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The point is is that most people
don't consume enough raw fruits

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables in a
spectrum of colors.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's the number one.

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, most
people are overfed

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:54.320 align:middle line:90%
and they're undernourished.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, their digestive
system is beaten up

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.030 align:middle line:84%
over years and years
and years of trying

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to digest, extract
the nutrients,

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and dispose of the waste
of the wrong kind of foods.

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is important as well
because it's easy to absorb.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate fast-food.

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.560 align:middle line:84%
People say, I want
a fast-food diet.

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Get juicing.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
the average dinner

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:27.200 align:middle line:84%
will take anything from four to
16 hours to leave the stomach,

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and the body try and digest it.

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Freshly extracted juice is
the 15 minute nutrient-express

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.350 align:middle line:90%
to health.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:35.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.183 align:middle line:90%
It goes into your stomach.

00:58:36.183 --> 00:58:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It goes, 15 minutes,
into your cells.

00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:42.459 align:middle line:84%
And also, let's be fair, you
will consume far more raw,

00:58:42.459 --> 00:58:44.125 align:middle line:84%
fresh vegetables, the
kind of vegetables

00:58:44.125 --> 00:58:46.052 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't ordinary eat.

00:58:46.052 --> 00:58:48.102 align:middle line:84%
Juiced, mixed with a
little bit of apple,

00:58:48.102 --> 00:58:49.810 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
pineapple, a bit of lime.

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You can jazz up some of these
juice so they taste divine.

00:58:53.520 --> 00:59:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine, you remove
refined sugars, refined fats,

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:11.240 align:middle line:84%
junkie-type foods, all
the wheat, the breads,

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.960 align:middle line:84%
the man-made foods
going into your body.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
overnight, you

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:17.860 align:middle line:84%
replace it with
high-water content--

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that's what it is--
pure high-water content,

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.940 align:middle line:84%
organic-rich, mineral,
vitamin-rich fuel going

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.330 align:middle line:84%
into every single
cell of your body

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.780 align:middle line:84%
in the most easy to
digest and absorb form

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and with a spectrum of
colors with everything

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.120 align:middle line:84%
the body requires-- what do you
think the body's going to do?

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.375 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not going to
reject this at all.

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It's going to look and
say, now, I'm on board.

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're good to me.

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Let me shine for you.

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>20 years ago,
this is what I saw

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:51.660 align:middle line:90%
when I looked in the mirror.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Looking good!

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, the years rolled by.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I kept seeing that same
fit-looking bloke looking back

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:58.210 align:middle line:90%
at me.

00:59:58.210 --> 00:59:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Who was I kidding?

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't look like that anymore.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.361 align:middle line:84%
I looked like I
swallowed a sheep.

01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:10.392 align:middle line:84%
So then, I started to
switch to alternative paths.

01:00:10.392 --> 01:00:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And I tried everything.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.460 align:middle line:90%
I did witch doctors.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.290 align:middle line:90%
I did mud baths.

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:16.310 align:middle line:90%
I did acupuncture.

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I did the lot.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:23.100 align:middle line:84%
The one thing which I was
really afraid to face up to

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.399 align:middle line:84%
was changing what I
put into my mouth.

01:00:26.399 --> 01:00:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd never heard of
a raw food restaurant.

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Raw food?

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.790 align:middle line:90%
How do you cook raw food?

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Look at that!

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Breakfast!

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.911 align:middle line:84%
>>This looks like
it should be mowed.

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>It actually was mowed.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.884 align:middle line:90%
And then, it turned into that.

01:00:35.884 --> 01:00:37.675 align:middle line:84%
>>I didn't know anything
about vegetarians.

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I knew Gandhi was a vegetarian.

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Vegan, I thought
vegan was a planet.

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea of that world.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.700 align:middle line:90%


01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>So I decided to experiment.

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was
fighting for life here.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:53.660 align:middle line:90%
What if it works?

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
farmer's market,

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:58.890 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of veggies-- beets and
kale and all sorts of things.

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
It all didn't look
attractive to me.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
no dessert there.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, I cleansed
for three days,

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.770 align:middle line:84%
just juicing, juicing, juicing,
and detoxifying my body.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I guess the way I look
at it was that I turned

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:13.630 align:middle line:90%
my back on Mother Nature.

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
conduct an experiment

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.850 align:middle line:90%
where I was the lab rat.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if I ran
towards her, full steam?

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Would she open her
arms and embrace me?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And would I be healed?

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I went straight to juicing
and a plant-based diet.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And within, basically, 10 to
15 days, the fog had lifted.

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And I was on the path.

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>After about two weeks, I did
notice my energy coming back.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And color was just a
little bit brighter.

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Just after three days of
cleanse, I lost seven pounds.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
After four months of
continuing healthy diet,

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I was cancer-free.

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%
My skin cleared.

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It was first time ever that I
lost weight naturally so fast.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>The end of the
day, you know, this

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like your last
area of control in the world.

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
What you do with this, what you
take and what you put in here,

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:12.219 align:middle line:90%
nobody can control you on.

01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:19.554 align:middle line:90%


01:02:19.554 --> 01:02:21.510 align:middle line:90%
[ALARM BEEPING]

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%


01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Cleansing and detoxification,
as a side-effect,

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.535 align:middle line:84%
will make you lose weight,
will make your eyes white,

01:02:34.535 --> 01:02:36.860 align:middle line:90%
will make your skin glow.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to
think about that, right?

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Those are side-effects of
cleansing and detoxification.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Whatever you're
going for, I think

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.978 align:middle line:84%
that you can
ultimately get it when

01:02:45.978 --> 01:02:48.487 align:middle line:84%
you start to change
your diet and lifestyle.

01:02:48.487 --> 01:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look
at me and they're like,

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.690 align:middle line:90%
you must be in your 20s.

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, I'm not.

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's always
a nice compliment.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I love hearing that people think
I'm a lot younger than I am.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm, you know,
heading into my 40s.

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I think that
this lifestyle has helped me

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.985 align:middle line:84%
not only with a chronic
disease but also feel young, be

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
young in my skin, and--
depending on the lighting--

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.050 align:middle line:90%
look pretty good too.

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>The truth is that we are
programmed, as a species,

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to be attracted to the
people who look good.

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the
healthiest ones.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>We are naturally designed to
screen each other for health

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:29.730 align:middle line:90%
for reproductive purposes.

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.397 align:middle line:84%
We look at each other,
and we see glowing skin,

01:03:32.397 --> 01:03:33.230 align:middle line:90%
we see shining eyes.

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:34.146 align:middle line:90%
And that's sexy to us.

01:03:34.146 --> 01:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
A confident person
is sexy to us.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Unconsciously, people
look for symmetry.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
They look for a steady skin tone
and not a lot of splotchy type

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.760 align:middle line:90%
of colors on your skin.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Why is this built into
our definition of beauty?

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Why does the beauty
industry spend

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:55.860 align:middle line:84%
so much time trying
to create products

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
that they put on your
skin to make your skin

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.660 align:middle line:90%
look artificially monotone?

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
because those are the cues

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.371 align:middle line:90%
that we pick up on.

01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It makes you look
younger or sexier.

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Ultimately, that to me
is what we're striving for,

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
is a deep richness of
skin tone, a deep richness

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
of hair, a lustre in our
nails, an overall feeling

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of shine and glow and
even almost an aura.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
This is possible
through natural foods.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is possible
through certain strategies

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.090 align:middle line:84%
of using natural foods
and certain supplements.

01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Through juicing especially,
and by avoiding fried foods,

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and avoiding the highly oxidated
foods that destroy your skin

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and destroy your
internal organs.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Fried foods are the worst, in
my opinion, and barbecued foods.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They're highly toxic, loaded
with carcinogenic chemicals.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
If you can avoid those, or at
least greatly reduce those,

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and increase your intake
of super foods-- chlorella

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and spirulina, fresh juice
from vegetables and fruits

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that you make in your own
kitchen-- then your skin,

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
within 30 days, will
turnaround completely.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Your friends will ask
you, what's your secret?

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell them, I've
been juicing fresh produce.

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:14.013 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well, I'm just
going buy a skin cream.

01:05:14.013 --> 01:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they want
the easier way.

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
good friends, they

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:19.970 align:middle line:90%
might start juicing with you.

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Because your juice
beats their skin cream.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>See, the skin is a true
symbol of our health.

01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the last
place to get nutrition.

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you can drive all
those nutrients all the way

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.525 align:middle line:84%
through to the
skin, then you know

01:05:33.525 --> 01:05:35.670 align:middle line:90%
it's gotten everywhere else too.

01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that we all recognize.

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's got
beautiful skin,

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
it tells us and invites us
to a deeper understanding

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
about what's going
on inside their body.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're
generally having

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
healthier liver, kidneys,
heart, lungs, et cetera.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's take vanity,
it's a very good entry way.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Because your skin looks better
when you're eating a diet

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.476 align:middle line:84%
that is low glycemic, where
the blood sugar is stable.

01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, that's
one of the first things

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.170 align:middle line:90%
that happens.

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Your skin, your hair, your
nails begin to look better.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
that I, personally,

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
stopped eating so many grains
and high glycemic foods is,

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
over the years, I noticed
a couple of things.

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there was weight
gain, every year a little more.

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And every year, harder
and harder to keep off.

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Second, me and my
patients all started

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to have fingernails that
broke, hair that broke,

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and skin that was getting all
red and broken blood vessels,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.900 align:middle line:90%
and all of that stuff.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
When you eat well,
that goes away.

01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>We can only eat
so much in a day.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the idea
of eating for beauty,

01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
let's make those foods
beauty foods, like olive oil

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and olives, cucumbers,
radishes, hemp seeds, aloe vera,

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.080 align:middle line:90%
coconut products.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Properly fermented food--
I'm talking about yogurt.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about kimchi.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about sauerkraut.

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We use those foods
to help us digest

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and to replenish
the bacteria that

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.400 align:middle line:90%
colonizes our intestinal tract.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's focus on the
beauty minerals--

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
like silica and
iron and manganese--

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that give glow and
charisma; sulphur

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and what it does to
our connective tissue

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and how it reverses
age-related lines

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and how it fills out
our protein make-up so

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that our musculature
and our overall build

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
reflects the higher qualities--
almost the symbolic qualities--

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:36.390 align:middle line:90%
that beauty points to.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:41.549 align:middle line:90%


01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The cosmetic industry seems to
be a wholesale dumping ground

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
for just about every
single type of chemical

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that exists from lead compounds,
mercury compounds, compounds

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that are made from horse
urine, namely urea.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
There are all different
kinds of synthetic compounds

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that make it into the
cosmetic industry,

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
like sodium laurel sulphate
and others sudsing agents that

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
are used in detergents that
are used in shampoos and body

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:14.050 align:middle line:90%
lotions, all this kind of stuff.

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:16.569 align:middle line:84%
>>The skin creams that
you buy are almost all

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
loaded with toxic chemicals.

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:21.689 align:middle line:84%
Most of them contain
fragrance chemicals.

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We did a lab analysis of
a popular perfume product

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and showed that it contains 21
different toxic, potentially

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.050 align:middle line:84%
carcinogenic chemicals, none of
which are listed on the label.

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:37.149 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
how do you want healthy skin?

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you want your skin to
be treated with nutrition

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:42.979 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out?

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to coat
it with petrochemicals

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and toxic chemicals and
artificial fragrance products

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:51.927 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, which
will be absorbed in?

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, they will get into
your liver, and your heart,

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.635 align:middle line:84%
and your kidneys,
and your brain.

01:08:55.635 --> 01:08:57.704 align:middle line:84%
And they will cause
disease inside.

01:08:57.704 --> 01:09:08.122 align:middle line:90%


01:09:08.122 --> 01:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not just
what you're eating.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It's also what's eating you.

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So where is the sweetness
missing in your life?

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.085 align:middle line:90%
What else is going on?

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
What kind of suffering
are you going through?

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
What's going on between
this ear and this ear?

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>There's an interesting
study called the ACE Study,

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
the Adverse
Childhood Experiences

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Study done by Vincent Feliti at
Kaiser Permanente in San Diego.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.569 align:middle line:84%
And they were working
with obese people.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And what he's come
to the conclusion of

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:41.069 align:middle line:84%
is that obesity is
not the problem.

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a solution.

01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:43.899 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look at that.

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:45.819 align:middle line:84%
It's a solution
to chronic stress.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:49.029 align:middle line:84%
It's a solution, in many
people, to sexual abuse,

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.932 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional family
situation, and so on.

01:09:51.932 --> 01:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I've talked to so
many people that have

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.250 align:middle line:90%
been overweight all their life.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask them,
when did it start?

01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.930 align:middle line:90%
When I was four years old.

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
What happened when you
were four years old?

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, my father was an
alcoholic and he beat me.

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Or we moved to another country.

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:08.159 align:middle line:90%
And I was really scared.

01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's look at where
you're not satisfied.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a dead-end job?

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Are you married to somebody
who treats you like crap?

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Are you suffocating under the
weight of too much pressure

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:18.995 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

01:10:18.995 --> 01:10:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Are there some old
residual traumas and dramas

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:25.300 align:middle line:90%
that need to be attended to?

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Some unfinished business
that's getting you stuck

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and making you keep
spinning your wheels

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.615 align:middle line:84%
that will, ultimately, encourage
you to make poor food choices?

01:10:34.615 --> 01:10:37.680 align:middle line:90%


01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Dear diary, today
I feel very sad.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.252 align:middle line:90%
And I want to eat everything.

01:10:42.252 --> 01:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people,
when they're stressed or sad,

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:49.630 align:middle line:84%
they turned to food for
comfort, especially,

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
old foods that they
ate growing up,

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
meatloaf, mashed
potatoes, cakes, cookies,

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
all of those things that you
ate or you got from your mom.

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
that time of being

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
nurtured and
nourished and whatnot.

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the best pieces
of advice I ever

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
got from a spiritual teacher
was, if you're upset,

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:10.660 align:middle line:90%
don't eat.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.340 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's so profound.

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes when we're
upset, we have no connection to

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we're satiated,
whether or not we're full.

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we're trying
to fill a void

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that can never be
filled with food.

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>So the type of
stresses are like nothing

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that you would ever associate
necessarily with weight gain--

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
sleep deprivation, dehydration,
mental and emotional stress.

01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
You're driving to work.

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You're stuck in traffic.

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Your boss is going
to get mad at you.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.400 align:middle line:90%
That's causing chemistry.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have a mental
or an emotional stress,

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
it's causing chemistry in
your body, real chemistry.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:51.962 align:middle line:84%
And when that chemistry is the
same chemistry as a famine,

01:11:51.962 --> 01:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to
want to gain weight.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to protect you
from the stresses in your life.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know what to do.

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:02.559 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a world where
it's so different from the way

01:12:02.559 --> 01:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
it was thousands of years ago
where all we had to worry about

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%
was not being eaten
by a tiger and where

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.160 align:middle line:90%
our next meal is coming from.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.045 align:middle line:84%
And now, we got
to worry about how

01:12:11.045 --> 01:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
we're going to pay our
mortgage or our credit card,

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.753 align:middle line:84%
or if our kid's going
to go to school,

01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
or if the world's
going to get blown up.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of these stresses
are causing chemistry.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies are
trying to protect us.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And people get so mad.

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.210 align:middle line:90%
We get so mad at our bodies.

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, we hate our
bodies because we

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.387 align:middle line:84%
think our body is
trying to sabotage us

01:12:27.387 --> 01:12:28.220 align:middle line:90%
or is out to get us.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.553 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a protection mechanism.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing more.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>When you're under
stress, you have

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the stress hormones,
cortisol and epinephrine.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever seen
anyone on steroid medication,

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
such as prednisone, you see that
the first thing that happens

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
is they gain 20 to 30 pounds,
no matter what they're eating.

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when your
cortisol stress

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
hormone levels are
high enough, they've

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:52.726 align:middle line:84%
documented the fact
that looking at a donut

01:12:52.726 --> 01:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
actually changes
your metabolism.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.440 align:middle line:90%


01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
The number one best way
to digest stress hormones

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:01.580 align:middle line:90%
is sleep.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And deep sleep will
metabolize excess cortisol

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and epinephrine better
than anything else.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want people
to try something.

01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
If you've been
under stress and you

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
sleep for only three
to four hours a night,

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.900 align:middle line:84%
you will gain two pounds
just from that alone.

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the stress
increases fluid retention.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.297 align:middle line:90%
So I call those liquid pounds.

01:13:25.297 --> 01:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
You want to take care
of those liquid pounds

01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
before they turn into real
pounds, which they inevitably

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:30.640 align:middle line:90%
will.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people are
sleep deprived now.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'd first like to give people
permission to sleep and sleep

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
as long as you need
to whenever you can.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's sleep.

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that
really metabolizes

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
stress hormones-- and this is
how the body was designed--

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.570 align:middle line:90%
is exercise.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
When you lift weights or
you simply take a long walk,

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.520 align:middle line:90%
you're doing a couple things.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
One is you're increasing those
feel-good hormones that you've

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.600 align:middle line:90%
normally gone to sugar for.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So exercise, taking a walk
three, four times a week,

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
is as good as anti-depressants
for mild to moderate

01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.872 align:middle line:90%
depression.

01:14:09.872 --> 01:14:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is insane.

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.141 align:middle line:90%
You just exercise alone.

01:14:12.141 --> 01:14:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when
you get out there

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.806 align:middle line:84%
and you do it and you're
in the fresh air and so on,

01:14:15.806 --> 01:14:16.760 align:middle line:90%
you feel much better.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's biochemical.

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is
sustainably pleasurable

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.080 align:middle line:90%
will decrease stress hormones.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Laughter decreases
them enormously.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend
that you have

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.300 align:middle line:90%
some funny movies lying around.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's been clinically shown
to improve immunity and also

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.963 align:middle line:90%
decrease pain.

01:14:37.963 --> 01:15:02.439 align:middle line:90%


01:15:02.439 --> 01:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of people look at my
before and after pictures,

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:06.840 align:middle line:90%
and they wonder how I did that.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.925 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the
body that I have now

01:15:08.925 --> 01:15:11.580 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the body that
I visualized having.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
that's a coincidence.

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about, why is
visualization so powerful

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.070 align:middle line:90%
for weight loss?

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And visualization for
body change in general,

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.027 align:middle line:84%
because Arnold
Schwarzenegger said

01:15:24.027 --> 01:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
he used to use
visualization to become

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
a professional,
champion bodybuilder.

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
best bodybuilders.

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
so many other people

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
that have been so successful
with visualization.

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But what I've realized
is visualization

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.100 align:middle line:84%
is like a language
that you can use

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.260 align:middle line:90%
to talk to your subconscious.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious is
the part of your brain

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that's in charge
of a lot of things.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.683 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that it's in charge of

01:15:47.683 --> 01:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is your body's
unconscious processes.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
How much oxygen you need
is not a conscious thought.

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:54.749 align:middle line:84%
You don't think, I
should breathe more.

01:15:54.749 --> 01:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
That's unconscious.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
How much your heartbeats
is unconscious.

01:15:57.650 --> 01:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And how fat or thin you should
be is an unconscious decision,

01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%
but it is a decision.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with this
subconscious or unconscious

01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
part of us is that it
doesn't speak English.

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we're being run by a
brain that we can't talk to.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized
is visualization

01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:17.880 align:middle line:84%
is like a language
that you can use

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.460 align:middle line:90%
to talk to your unconscious.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because just like you can't talk
to someone who doesn't speak

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.509 align:middle line:84%
your language--
say you have to go

01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to the bathroom in
a foreign country,

01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
you could ask 1,000 people
where the bathroom is.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.413 align:middle line:90%
They won't tell you.

01:16:28.413 --> 01:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you draw a
picture of a bathroom

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
on a napkin in the
restaurant or something

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and show it to anyone,
instantly, they

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.100 align:middle line:90%
know what you mean.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:42.919 align:middle line:84%
Visualization or symbols is the
universal language for people

01:16:42.919 --> 01:16:44.210 align:middle line:90%
that don't speak your language.

01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And your body doesn't
speak your language.

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
When you make a visual
image of the way

01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to look-- it
could be you at another time

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:54.102 align:middle line:84%
when you were fit and
healthy and happy,

01:16:54.102 --> 01:16:55.310 align:middle line:90%
or it could be somebody else.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the
picture for 30 seconds

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
like, if you're looking
through the picture

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.120 align:middle line:90%
in an unconscious way.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.828 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at the
picture with your eyes.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Look through it.

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Let your subconscious absorb
it for just 30 seconds.

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, close your eyes
and either see yourself,

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
feel yourself, imagine
yourself being in that body.

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself
walking on the beach

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:21.972 align:middle line:84%
with that body,
whatever way you can do.

01:17:21.972 --> 01:17:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And you do it when your mind is
calm and powerful and relaxed.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Your subconscious understands.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And it understands that
it doesn't need fat

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.742 align:middle line:84%
and that it's
confusing the stresses.

01:17:33.742 --> 01:17:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
doesn't know what

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.934 align:middle line:84%
to do with the stresses
of modern life.

01:17:36.934 --> 01:17:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Do I get fatter?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Do I get thinner?

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
How do I protect this
person who's so scared?

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.680 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes it uses fat.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you can communicate
with your subconscious and say,

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:46.710 align:middle line:90%
no.

01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:47.695 align:middle line:90%
That's not the answer.

01:17:47.695 --> 01:17:48.650 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:50.675 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what's happening.

01:17:50.675 --> 01:17:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Then, OK.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.596 align:middle line:90%
I'll turn the fat programs off.

01:17:52.596 --> 01:17:54.950 align:middle line:84%
[SNAP] Just like that,
everything changes.

01:17:54.950 --> 01:18:04.990 align:middle line:90%


01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Unfortunately, most
people-- and when

01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I say most that's like
over 50% of people--

01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
get out of that morning shower,
have a look at themselves

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror when
they're alone.

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're not happy
with what they see.

01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:20.400 align:middle line:90%
They're just not happy.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And they start out their day by
berating themselves and telling

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
them they're a loser,
and that they're no good,

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and they've got to lift their
game, and all these things.

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you had someone who was
with you 24/7, that was just

01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:36.482 align:middle line:84%
whispering that in
your ear all the time,

01:18:36.482 --> 01:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
that wouldn't last five minutes

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:39.940 align:middle line:90%
with me.

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we allow ourselves
to do it to ourselves.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a group that I go
to that says, let us love you.

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you love yourself?

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I first heard
that, I was so sad.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I became aware of the
depth of my self-loathing.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Death seemed-- at least,
I wasn't suicidal.

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I occasionally had
bouts with thoughts.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was like,
I wasn't suicidal.

01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.885 align:middle line:90%
But I welcomed death.

01:19:13.885 --> 01:19:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know what?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Just turn the switch, turn
off, flick the off button.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready for the
big sleep, man.

01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:29.320 align:middle line:90%


01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's at that point that the
genesis of willingness emerges.

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the genesis
of willingness.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And that crack, as
Leonard Cohen says,

01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
it's the cracks that
lets the light in.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And that crack let the light in.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>So something miraculous,
something powerful

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
happens when you take
care of yourself.

01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
You realize that
you are precious.

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:54.220 align:middle line:90%


01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
You become in love with
yourself, basically.

01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And it shines.

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.010 align:middle line:90%
It overflows to others.

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It becomes contagious.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
You give others the permission
to be in love with themselves

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.372 align:middle line:90%
and in love with life.

01:20:04.372 --> 01:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>What was the most important
thing to keep off the weight?

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
What do I believe was the
most crucial component?

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Without question, love.

01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:15.230 align:middle line:90%


01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Love for myself and
love for other people.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>And when you think about
love, what love is really,

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:24.730 align:middle line:90%
is love is safety.

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
zero years old,

01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:29.340 align:middle line:84%
when you're a couple weeks
old, if your mother doesn't

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.467 align:middle line:90%
love you, you're going to die.

01:20:31.467 --> 01:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Your mother has to take care
of you and has to feed you.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
You are totally helpless.

01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So from the moment we're born,
we equate love with safety.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.575 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel
like you're not being

01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
loved because your partner
or a boyfriend or girlfriend

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
doesn't love you, or because
someone out there doesn't

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.089 align:middle line:84%
love you, then your
primal feeling of safety

01:20:52.089 --> 01:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
is being triggered.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.420 align:middle line:90%
That activates a stress.

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make you
want to hold onto weight.

01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:59.381 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years ago, if the
community didn't love you,

01:20:59.381 --> 01:21:00.380 align:middle line:90%
you were excommunicated.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.980 align:middle line:90%


01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
The tribe didn't love you,
you're excommunicated.

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And so, then you die.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't survive on
your own in a tribal world.

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's totally hard-wired into
us that love equals safety.

01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:37.630 align:middle line:90%


01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>I actually think that the
concept of loving yourself

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:43.360 align:middle line:90%
is key to all of it.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Without that, nothing else
is going to be sustainable.

01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a
message in your head,

01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm a worthless piece
of crap, and my life

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
doesn't count for anything,
and I'm always a failure,

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and I screw up all the time,
and I'll never be good enough,

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never make it,
and no one loves me,

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:02.485 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
you do is you know

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:04.850 align:middle line:90%
that they're probably there.

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And Louise Hay of Hay House
has a wonderful practice.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone would just
really do it for 30 days--

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and for years I wrote it
out on a prescription.

01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:16.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here it is.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I accept myself
unconditionally right now.

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd write it on
the prescription.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Their job was to post it on
their bathroom mirror and twice

01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
a day, look deep into
their eyes and say--

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:33.385 align:middle line:84%
>>I accept myself
unconditionally right now.

01:22:33.385 --> 01:22:38.082 align:middle line:84%
>>Then, you wait for
the messages to arise.

01:22:38.082 --> 01:22:39.040 align:middle line:90%
You're a piece of shit.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you
can love yourself.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Look at your thighs.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:44.260 align:middle line:90%
You see all that cellulite?

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
What about that butt of yours?

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.320 align:middle line:90%
You're 30 pounds overweight.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
You're unmarried.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
You're a middle aged
woman with cats.

01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:51.529 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
acceptable about you.

01:22:51.529 --> 01:22:52.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going to come up.

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.020 align:middle line:84%
If you do this for 30
days, by about day 28,

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.700 align:middle line:90%
something shifts inside.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.150 align:middle line:90%
And you begin to believe it.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you're planting
a new affirmation.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Rudyard Kipling said, I am
by nature, a dealer in words.

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And words are the most powerful
drug known to humanity.

01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So you are giving yourself
different messages.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to do that, you

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
begin to develop--
like a muscle--

01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:29.960 align:middle line:84%
this witness-self that
listens to you talk.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger that
witness-self gets,

01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:34.300 align:middle line:90%
the healthier you get.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
As a doctor, let me tell
you what self-love does.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It improves your
hearing, your eyesight.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It lowers your blood pressure.

01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It increases pulmonary
function, cardiac output,

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:48.300 align:middle line:90%
helps wire in the musculature.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we had a rampant
epidemic of self-love,

01:23:56.010 --> 01:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
then our health care costs
would go down dramatically.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't just some little
frou-frou New Age notion,

01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know, love
yourself, honey.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.145 align:middle line:90%
This is hard-core science.

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:16.048 align:middle line:90%


01:24:16.048 --> 01:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>So you can improve your life
and your mind and your mindset.

01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:23.874 align:middle line:84%
Your outlook on
life can improve.

01:24:23.874 --> 01:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask
just, basically,

01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:26.990 align:middle line:90%
three simple questions.

01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Where does my food come from?

01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:33.100 align:middle line:84%
What went into the food, in
terms of attitude or care

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.250 align:middle line:90%
or love or compassion?

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, thirdly,
what is my intention

01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%
of doing with the food?

01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Is the food to support
me for a good purpose?

01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:44.160 align:middle line:90%
To do something productive?

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just entertainment?

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Your body is
designed to be healthy.

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Health is the natural state.

01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:51.762 align:middle line:84%
And if we let our
body do what it

01:24:51.762 --> 01:24:53.970 align:middle line:84%
wants to do in an environment
where all the foods are

01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:55.387 align:middle line:84%
healthy choices--
all of them-- we

01:24:55.387 --> 01:24:57.595 align:middle line:84%
don't have to be concerned
with these things anymore.

01:24:57.595 --> 01:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And we can live without
fear of weight gain.

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And we can live without fear
of degenerative disease.
