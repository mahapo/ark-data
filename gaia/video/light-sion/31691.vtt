00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome, everyone.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:84%
There are three things I want
to talk with you about today.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
First, as predicted
by ancient prophecy,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the light of the center of our
galaxy called Sion is rising.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:84%
It's delivering a hidden
vibration or power to Earth.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They who bathe in these energies
are called the Anointed.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The Anointed are fearless
ones who grab this energy

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and light up their souls,
not for service to themselves

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:90%
but for service to all.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:10%
The third thing is,
there's a tribe of beings

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:10%
that comes from the
center of the galaxy,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:10%
and according to
these prophecies

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:10%
they will be returning in
the period from 2012 on.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to open with
a quote from Dr. Carl

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Sagan from his presentation
Cosmos from back in 1976,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
in which he said, "The
surface of the earth

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
is the shore of
the cosmic ocean."

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I love that quote for the
word picture that it painted,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
because it told us
that back then we

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
were preparing to step
out into the galaxy.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we did, we looked back,
and for the first time ever

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:90%
we saw our planet from space.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
This photograph called Earthrise
was published on Christmas

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
of 1968, and with it came
in extraordinary message

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.297 align:middle line:90%
for humankind.

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
As people looked at this, it
touched their hearts deeply

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:84%
because they realized
we're all one race.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
There are no lines
separating people here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
This photograph inspired
the environmental movement,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
who used it with slogans
that said love your mother,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
because we began to recognize
that our home planet was

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
in fact a living being,
an organic being,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and that we had to
take care of her.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, since then a new
image has been introduced

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
into human consciousness that
is also having a tremendously

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
expansive effect,
and that's the image

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
of our Milky Way
galaxy from afar.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
If we could step outside
our galaxy and look back

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.457 align:middle line:84%
we would see it as this
magnificent cosmic disk.

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
now is that we're

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
beginning to recognize
that we are part

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of this great cosmic
organism the Milky Way,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and that we're
connected to what must

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
be a vast number
of civilizations

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, we're beginning
to orient ourselves

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
towards the center of
our Milky Way galaxy,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're beginning
to now follow

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
a trail into the galaxies
itself, into the universe.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing photographs
such as this of the galaxy

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda, our nearby
neighbor, and also of Pegasus,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're beginning to wonder
just how many civilizations

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
there might be out there
in the known universe.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
NASA tells us there might be
as many as 450 billion galaxies

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.866 align:middle line:84%
similar to our own in
the known universe,

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and then they tell
us there might

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:90%
be multiple universes out there.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.922 align:middle line:84%
We're entered into a realm of
extraordinary possibility here.

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to
ask you to consider

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the ancients might
have known quite a bit

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
about the Milky Way, and they
left us a trail to follow.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:10%
For example, when you
go to the temple of Isis

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:10%
at Sais in Egypt, it
says "I am all that is,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:10%
all that hath been, and
all that will forever be;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:10%
and my veil no moral
hath drawn aside."

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:10%
If in fact we're talking
about the Milky Way here,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:10%
then this is literally
a true statement,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:10%
because until now the center
of our Milky Way galaxy

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:10%
has literally been
obscured from us.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Now with the invention
of telescopes, and radio

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
telescopes, and
infrared telescopes,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
we're able to peer beyond
the veil of the galaxy

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and look into the
galactic center.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:10%
And what science is showing us
is absolutely extraordinary.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:10%
Here's a selection
of images from NASA

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.665 align:middle line:10%
and other space observatory's
that are showing us

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.703 align:middle line:10%
what the center of
our galaxy looks like.

00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
As we look at these
images, I'd like

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
you to pay close attention
to the colors that

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
are used to symbolize
the center of the galaxy.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:84%
High purples,
pinks, and fuchsias.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:84%
These are the colors
of the divine feminine.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And based on what
the ancients said,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
our galaxy is in fact
feminine in nature.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
She is the great cosmic mother.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So it makes perfect
sense for them

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:90%
to pick these color schemes.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
This is an artist's conception
of the Arches star cluster

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
at the center of our
Milky Way galaxy.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about this
is that the ancients said

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that the center of the galaxy
was not only a star nursery,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
it was also perhaps
a soul nursery.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So what in fact we
could be looking at here

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is not the creation
of stars, but actually

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:90%
the creation of souls.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
This is remarkable, because
in the Gnostic tradition,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the Enlightenment
tradition of the past,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
they tell us that we all have a
divine spark within us, a seed

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
atom, a tiny piece, a spark of
the original great fire that

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
once existed at the
center of the galaxy.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is this divine spark
that creates our human body

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
as a vehicle for exploration.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:10%
What they further
tell us is that there

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:10%
is a part of ourselves,
our divine self, in fact,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:10%
that still dwells in the
center of the galaxy, that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:10%
still dwells in Sion.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:10%
This wonderful painting
is by an American artist

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:10%
named Thomas Cole, that shows
a baby soul on the boat of time

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:10%
emerging from some center place.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Along for the ride is an angelic
being, a bright white being

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of light that actually
represents this soul's higher

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
There are different names
for this higher self.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called the heavenly twin,
the angelic spirit, the guide

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of flight, the guide of
the soul, the man of light,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the perfect nature,
and the divine spark.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
What the Gnostics teach
is that we-- many of us--

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
have forgotten about our
heavenly twin, our divine self,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to remember
this aspect of ourselves,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
because it is the
part of ourselves that

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:84%
seeks to enlighten us and to
return us to the light of Sion.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I was once in Florida giving
a presentation about this

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the audience
if they have ever

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.544 align:middle line:84%
connected with
their higher self,

00:06:29.544 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and if so how do they know
when they make that connection.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget
one woman's answer.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:10%
She said, that in
times of crisis,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:10%
in times of fear, times of
uncertainty, I hear this voice

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:10%
and it always asked
me the same question,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:10%
what would you do if
you weren't afraid?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:10%
And that to me is the
message of the light of Sion.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It's asking us to
overcome our fear

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and to connect with
that higher self

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and to operate from that
higher, finer place.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time
for us to do this.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Mayans, we are entering

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
into a very special
time of prophecy.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
For at sunrise on
December 21, 2012

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
in 26,000 years,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
our sun rises to conjunct the
intersection of the Milky Way

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:90%
and the plane of the ecliptic.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
This cosmic cross,
as they call it,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be the
embodiment of the sacred tree,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life, which
is a tree remembered

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
in all the world's
spiritual traditions.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Some observers
say this alignment

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
with the heart of
our galaxy, Sion,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
will open a channel
for cosmic energy

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to flow through the Earth,
cleansing it and all

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that dwells upon it, raising all
to a higher level of vibration,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
transforming us into
righteous beings.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the gospel of 2012,
the good news of 2012.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about it
is that NASA has actually

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
discovered an energy source
at the center of our Milky Way

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:84%
In November 2010, NASA
published this amazing image

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
of 26,000 light year tall
plumes of energy coming

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
our Milky Way galaxy.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
NASA really doesn't

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
know what caused this
massive plume of energy

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to suddenly be detected.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Was it the result
of a star formation

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:10%
at the center of the galaxy?

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:10%
Or, was it the
result of a expulsion

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:10%
of energy from the black hole
at the center of our galaxy?

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:10%
The thing is,
scientists don't know.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:10%
They're baffled by this image.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:10%
But when we look back
into the ancient record,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:10%
we find clues for
what might actually

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:10%
be the nature of this energy.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
ancient Israelites

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
followed a pillar of fire
by day and a pillar of fire

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
by night as they were
wandering in the wilderness.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that what
NASA has discovered for us

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
here is this pillar of
fire by day and pillar

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:90%
of fire by night?

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Are we sinking once again
with the center of the galaxy?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Are we aligning our
consciousness the way

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
the ancients said
that they had done?

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:10%
And will this be
the motivating force

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:10%
that begins to transform
us as a species?

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:10%
I believe so.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that images
such as this from NASA

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:10%
are proving what
the ancients knew

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:10%
about the center of the
galaxy, and it's time

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:10%
now for us to put away our fear,
to overcome our limitations,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:10%
and to become the
true humans that we

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:10%
know that we can become.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
In 1896, a remarkable
document was

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Egypt called
the Apocryphon of John,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:90%
or the secret Book of John.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It purports to contain the
secret teachings of Jesus that

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
were given to one of his
disciples named John.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
In the story, John had
been at the Temple,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and he had a
confrontation with one

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
of the temple elders, who said
that Jesus had been misleading

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
him and that John needs to
come back into the Temple fold.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
John goes out into
the desert and he

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
has a bit of a confused moment
where he's saying, well,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure
about who Jesus really

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
was, where he came
from, and what

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
he meant about all
this eternal life

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
business that he
was talking about.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the heavens
opened up, a beam of light

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
manifested, and from out of this
beam of light appears Jesus.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Jesus tells to John, I have
come to teach you about what is,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and what was, and what
will be, in order for you

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
invisible world,

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and the world that is visible,
and the immovable race

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
of perfect humanity.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So here Jesus
seems to be talking

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
about a separate race
of human beings referred

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
to as the perfect humans.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Could these be the
same light beings

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that the Tibetans have
described and other traditions

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
have described as well?

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's
what he's talking about.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
He goes on to say to
John, raise your head.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Understand my lessons.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Share them with any others who
have received the spirit who

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
are from the immovable
race of perfect humanity.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So once again, we
are asked to believe

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that there is this
separate race of humankind.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Ascended humans
who have achieved

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:90%
the next level of manifestation.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Another figure who had
an encounter with Jesus

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
as a perfect being is
Saint Francis of Assisi.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Francis was a mystic who
focused on and meditated

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:90%
on the deep love of God.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment
of ecstasy, Jesus

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
manifested to him
as a perfect being.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually the artist
Giotto-- the Italian artist--

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:90%
portrayed Jesus as a seraphim.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.554 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
Francis' encounter--

00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
his description
of his encounter--

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
where he said Jesus manifested
before him as a seraph.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
What is extraordinary about
these depictions of Jesus

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
appearing as a seraph
to Saint Francis

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the name
Quetzalcoatl means

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
winged serpent or
feathered serpent.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly the
definition of the seraphs

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:90%
in Judeo-Christian tradition.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They are the fiery serpents
or winged serpents.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Are we here seeing
Jesus manifesting

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
as one of the members of this
tribe of beings, of the seraphs

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:90%
of the perfected light humans.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's exactly
what we're seeing.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a painting by a
Franciscan of the crucifixion

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:84%
in which Jesus is
being transformed

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
into one of these seraph angels.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Francis is portrayed levitating.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this whole painting
portrays this extraordinary kit

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric teachings
about humankind

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and how we can be transformed
into perfect light humans.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Following the trail
of Saint Francis

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
leads us into this
extraordinary mystic teaching.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we are being told that
Sion, the center of the galaxy,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
is a realm beyond
the physical realm,

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and that it is inhabited
by higher dimensional

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
beings, actually transformed
or ascended humans.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we are being
told Sion is inhabited

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:84%
by otherworldly
beings, the seraphs,

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
the perfect light humans.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
They are ascended humans,
transformed humans.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And what we are being asked
to do is to put away our fear,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to raise our vibration, to
connect with these beings,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:90%
and in fact to become them.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
That is the
extraordinary potential

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that is within each
and every one of us,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and as the Mayans are telling
us, the period from 2012

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
on is the era in
which we will see

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation
of these beings.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But the Gnostic Christians
have the same message for us,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
telling us that we must
become perfect before leaving

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%
this world.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We must become whole,
holy, complete.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:84%
We must achieve this next
level of human manifestation,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:90%
the perfect light human.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Jesus talks about perfection
in an incredible meeting

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:84%
with the rich man, when he
says, I tell you the truth,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for a rich man to
enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Again I tell you, it's
easier for a camel

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
eye of the needle

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
than for a rich man to
enter the Kingdom of God.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when
Jesus is talking

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
about the eye of the
needle he's talking

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
about opening the eye or
the mouth of the wormhole.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And what he's telling
us is that in order

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to enter the eye
of the needle, we

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to disembark
from or unload all of the stuff

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.907 align:middle line:84%
that we're carrying
around in this world.

00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What had happened in this story
is that the rich man had asked

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, what is required
for eternal life?

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' response was,
follow the commandments.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The commandments are
love with all your heart,

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%
all your mind, all your soul.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the first and
greatest commandment.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And the second is like unto it.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Love your neighbor as yourself.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
All the law and the prophets
hang on these two commandments.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The rich man came
back to Jesus and said

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that he had always followed
those commandments.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:10%
I doubt Jesus believed
him, but then he

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:10%
told him, if thou wilt be
perfect, meaning whole, holy,

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:10%
and complete, go and
sell what you have.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:10%
Give it to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in Heaven

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:10%
and come and follow me.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is Jesus
telling him that in order

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to enter the Kingdom of God,
Sion, the center of the galaxy,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
we are going to have to
become perfect light humans.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We are going to have to
achieve the rainbow body.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So who are these higher
vibrational or angelic beings

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that dwell at the throne of God
at the center of the Milky Way

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, and who
travel back and forth

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:90%
from that galactic center?

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer in
Judeo-Christian tradition

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:90%
is it's the seraphim.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:84%
These are the highest
order of angels.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:10%
As they were developed in
Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:10%
they are considered to
be beings of pure light

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:10%
and pure love who dwell
at the throne of God

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:10%
and constantly sing holy chants.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But as we see in history, they
are constantly coming and going

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
the Milky Way galaxy,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
influencing human affairs.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
During the Renaissance
there was a belief

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that these beings were actually
ascended human beings, humans

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%
who had connected with
the love of the creator

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and focused so deeply
on the love of God

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that they were transformed
into these angelic beings,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the brightest angels
of all, the seraphim.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
In Judeo-Christian art you can
always identify the seraphim

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
because they have these
vortex shaped bodies

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:90%
with six wings and human faces.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They are portrayed as
half human and half bird.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And what we see are
seraphim portrayed

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
as some of the most
extraordinary beings

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
of all angelic literature
and iconography.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
When we go back into the
Bible we get more information

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.059 align:middle line:84%
about these beings at
the galactic center.

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Our arrival at
Sion on, according

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to the book of Hebrews,
marks our acceptance

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
into an innumerable
company of angels

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:90%
and just humans made perfect.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The word just means upright,
righteous, and balanced.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The word humans,
of course, refers

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to a member of the
species Homo sapiens,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:90%
not animal, divine, or machine.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Made means shaped or formed.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And the word perfect means
whole, holy, compassionate.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So these beings who dwell
at the center of the galaxy

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
are just humans made perfect.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They are the next
level of humanity.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
They are the beings we are
in the process of becoming

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and are in fact
striving to become.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fact they
are looking for us.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They are looking for us to
raise our awareness about them

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to match
their level of frequency

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:90%
or vibration.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Something that is
highly interesting to me

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
is the correspondence between
the seraphim, the just humans

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
made perfect, and
the Tibetan tradition

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:90%
called the great perfection.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
In the Tibetan tradition
of the great perfection,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
the human body can

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
be transformed into a next
level of vibration which

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:90%
they call the rainbow body.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
In this tradition, they tell
us that through changing

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of
their body the yogini

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
can dissolve their subtle
essences, the body's

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
subtle energy, and
ultimately manifest as five

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:84%
colored rainbow light,
leaving behind only hair, toe,

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and fingernails, which have
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Then they literally glow rays.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
They become these glowing beings
with rainbow colored bodies.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So over and again in
Tibetan tradition,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:84%
when we see these depictions
of the rainbow body beings,

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:84%
they have these
multicolor bodies

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be
sort of like vortexes.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We see these swirling energy
patterns around their body

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that are actually counter
rotating energy fields.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:84%
This is very fascinating
to us, because when

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
we compare the Judeo-Christian
images of the seraphim

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
with their vortex shaped bodies
with the Tibetan depictions

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:84%
of the beings who've
achieved the rainbow body,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:90%
we have a near perfect match.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell the story
about how I became interested

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
in the whole concept
of the rainbow body.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I was at a conference in
California several years ago,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and a lovely couple came
up to me during the event

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and said that they were
great fans of my work,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and they studied my
work extensively.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
In addition, they both had
PhDs from the Harvard Divinity

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
They studied with
the Dalai Lama.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:90%
They knew the Dalai Lama.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
They had lived in India,
and translate Tibetan texts,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
specifically those relating
to the rainbow body.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.655 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me if I had
any awareness or understanding

00:20:01.655 --> 00:20:02.154 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:20:02.154 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, I didn't.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And they told me essentially
what I've just told you,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Tibetans believe
that the human body can

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
be spun into a vortex of energy
that ultimately manifests

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:84%
as five colored rainbow
light or the rainbow body.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And what the Tibetans teach is
that once these Lamas or yogis

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
have achieved the rainbow
body, that they are then

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
able to travel to an additional
13 star systems, including

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
our own, where this rainbow
body teaching is taught.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And what they always wondered
was how did they get there?

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Once they've achieved
the rainbow body

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and can travel to
these star systems,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:90%
how do they travel there?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that they were
watching my presentation Star

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Walkers and the
Dimension of the Blessed,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:90%
and they got their answer.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
What I had discussed
in Star Walkers

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
was the ancient Egyptians
belief in the eternal being.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The beings that the
Egyptians portray

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
on the ceilings--
for example, here

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
at the temple of
Hathor at Dendera,

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
the temple of love and joy--
show the ascended Egyptian gods

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and pharaohs
traveling for eternity

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
on board what they called
their ships of eternity,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:84%
or the ark of the
millions of years.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
started studying

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
the ark of the millions of
years and the Egyptian belief

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
in eternity, I was
immediately struck

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:90%
by something extraordinary.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
That is the way the
ancient Egyptians portrayed

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
the ship of eternity in
there artwork precisely

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
matches the way modern
science portrays a wormhole.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you do a A to B
comparison of the Egyptian ark

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
of the millions of years
or ship of eternity

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:84%
with the modern scientific
drawing of the wormhole,

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:90%
they're a perfect match.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And what this suggested to me
is that the Egyptians are saying

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
is that their descended
beings, their god beings,

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
who they said we're light
beings who traveled the stars,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.380 align:middle line:84%
were traveling the stars
through stargates and wormholes.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
When this couple who were
experts in the rainbow body

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
saw this, they immediately
got their answer

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
for how the Tibetan Lamas
who've achieved the rainbow body

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
travel to these
other star systems.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
They open a wormhole.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:10%
Or perhaps they travel
to these star systems

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:10%
through the naturally
occurring wormholes

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:10%
that modern science now tells us
actually permeates our galaxy.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:10%
Either way, I
believe we're talking

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:10%
about a perfect match
between the Tibetan

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient Egyptian
tradition of beings

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:10%
who transform themselves
into beings of light

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and travel these
wormholes for eternity.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I took this work
one step forward

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:84%
by comparing the
Christian tradition

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
with the Egyptian
tradition of Jesus

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:90%
traveling into the underworld.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.662 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
Egyptian gods traveling

00:22:49.662 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
on the ship of eternity,
they're actually

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:84%
descending in what they call the
netherworld or the underworld.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:10%
We see Jesus descending into
a netherworld or underworld

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:10%
in between crucifixion
and Resurrection.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:10%
And in Christian art
that portrays this,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:10%
we always see the same thing.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:10%
We see Jesus in front of an

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:10%
Open gateway composed
of concentric rings

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:10%
that's filled with stars.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And the question I pose
is could this in fact

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:10%
be a representation
of a stargate

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:10%
or a wormhole, an
interdimensional transportation

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:10%
system?

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:10%
When Jesus descends
into the underworld,

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:10%
is he actually opening
a stargate or a wormhole

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:10%
and traveling into another
realm to retrieve the souls who

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:10%
are dwelling there as
Christian tradition teaches?

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is
exactly what's happening.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I furthermore believe that
the source for this imagery

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the ancient Egyptian
tradition, because when we see

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Jesus as we see him here in
the opening of this gateway,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
he could well be in the opening
of the mouth of the wormhole,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and he is exactly the same as
Osiris, the resurrected god

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt,
shown here traveling

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
aboard his ark of the millions
of years or ship of eternity.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:90%
They're a perfect match.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Acts tells
us that Jesus ascended.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the shortest
stories in the Bible.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell us
exactly how he ascended,

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
but Christian artwork
informs us about how

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
it's believed this
actually occurred.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Acts says
that Jesus was taken up

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:84%
before the disciples' very
eyes and a cloud hid him

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.600 align:middle line:90%
from their sight.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The disciples were looking
intently up into the sky

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:84%
as he was going, when suddenly
two men dressed in white stood

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
beside them.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Men of Galilee, they
said, why do you

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:90%
stand here looking into the sky?

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
This same Jesus who has been
taken from you into Heaven

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
will come back in
the same way you

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:90%
have seen him go into Heaven.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
How does Christian are portray
Jesus ascending into Heaven?

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They show him aboard
a ring composed

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of concentric rings that is held
aloft by angels, a winged ring.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:84%
When I compare this artwork
with the way modern science

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:84%
portrays a wormhole, it
opens up the speculation

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that what we're talking
about is Jesus ascending

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:20.130 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens in a
wormwhole or a stargate.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Book of Acts
tells us that he

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:90%
will return the same way.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember what the Mayans
said about Quetzalcoatl.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
He will return to Earth riding
upon a serpent rope that

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
also could be a wormhole.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking here about
an ancient sacred tradition

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of these higher vibrational
beings, super human beings

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that have a
capability of traveling

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
the stars through
stargates and wormholes?

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's exactly
what is going on.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And we are now at a level
of technological and perhaps

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:84%
spiritual sophistication
where we can readily

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.060 align:middle line:84%
interpret exactly what is
going on in this artwork

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and fully understand
what is happening here.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about a race
of beings who have the ability

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to transform themselves
into beings of light

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and travel from Earth to
the center of the galaxy

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and return through
stargates and wormholes.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So, when we look at this
ascension art, this, I propose,

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what
we're looking at.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about Jesus as
a member of a tribe of beings

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
who have this
extraordinary capability,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and they wish for
us to join them.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:10%
So in my opinion, when we're
looking at this ascension

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:10%
scene of Jesus ascending into
the heavens in a winged ring,

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:10%
and we compare it
with the Mayan image

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:10%
of the center of
the galaxy opening

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:10%
and the umbilical cord, the
serpent rope, the wormhole,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:10%
descending into the
Earth realm, we're

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:10%
actually talking about
exactly the same story.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And, if traditions such as
the Mormons are correct,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
then Jesus and Quetzalcoatl
are actually, if not

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the same person,
certainly a member

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
of the same tribe of beings.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And this then fully illuminates
the Russian depictions

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
from the 14th Century of the
Last Judgment, in which we

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:84%
see this strange serpent
emanating from the earth plane,

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:90%
going into the Heavenly realms.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But what we now know is
that that is actually

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:90%
a two way transportation system.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a cosmic tunnel
system that modern science

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:90%
calls a wormhole.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The original
inspiration for this

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:84%
might actually be this depiction
here from Torcello in Italy,

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
where we see Jesus
enthroned within an egg

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and we see this umbilical cord,
called a ribbon of hellfire

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:84%
in the Christian
tradition, emanating

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
from the center of this throne
and coming into the Earth

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Could this in fact be a
stargate or a wormhole

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
when we see Jesus enthroned
here in the concentric rings,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with this vibrant
fire all around him,

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
these rays of light, and
the umbilical cord emanating

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:90%
from those concentric rings?

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Are we in fact looking at
a stargate or a wormhole?

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:90%
I believe we are.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And as I said a
moment ago, I further

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:84%
believe that ancient Egypt
is the original source

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:90%
for this imagery.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:10%
Look at this pyramidion
from the Cairo Museum

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:10%
that portrays the
ascension of Osiris,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptian god
of resurrection.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Osiris is portrayed
inside of a chamber that

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:10%
is called the [? shetiyet ?]
or the ascension chamber.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It was within the
ascension chamber

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that Osiris was
transformed from a mortal

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:90%
being into a light being.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Are we here again talking about
some kind of a transportation

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:84%
portal or the entrance
to that portal?

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's exactly
what we're looking at.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's another example,
also from the Cairo Museum,

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
where we see Osiris
as Sokar, another form

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:90%
of the resurrected Osiris.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:84%
We see two priestesses on
either side of this portal,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:90%
or this gateway.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:84%
They are beaming energy to him
or receiving energy from him.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Either way, they are assisting
him in his ascension.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:10%
He is preparing to embark
upon his journey on the ship

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.510 align:middle line:10%
or the ark of the
millions of years.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:10%
Now let's compare the
ancient Egyptian image

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:10%
with this [? bozze ?] from
Saint Paul's Cathedral

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:10%
in London from the 18th Century.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:10%
We see Jesus emerging from
a radiant gateway, a portal,

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:10%
that is flanked by two angels.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is lit up in light.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
He has become a
light being, and he's

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:84%
either stepping
into that gateway

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:84%
or exiting through that
gateway into the higher realms.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:10%
There's no question in my
mind that the original source

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.490 align:middle line:10%
for this imagery is the
ancient Egyptian image

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.690 align:middle line:10%
of Osiris in the
ascension portal.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel that what's
happening here

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:84%
is that we're seeing an
updating of the ancient Egyptian

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
tradition in the
Christian tradition.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But today we're taking this
imagery one step forward.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Modern science and
science fiction talks

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
about the concept of the
stargate, the ring or gateway

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that we can enter
into and travel

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to distant star
systems-- or perhaps even

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:90%
to distant galaxies.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And the symbol for the
stargate is the circular ring

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.550 align:middle line:10%
or gateway.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:10%
When we take the image of
the ring or the gateway

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:10%
and apply it to the Tibetan
image of the rainbow body,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:10%
we can see clearly that what
we're talking about here

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:10%
is the Tibetans
transforming their bodies

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:10%
into a beam of
light, and then being

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:10%
able to access these gateways.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.870 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this is what
this couple told me

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:10%
they believe is happening is
that when the Tibetans achieve

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow body,
they literally turn

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:10%
their body into a
wormhole, and then

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:10%
are able to travel to
these distant star systems.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's more than
just fascinating

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to compare the Christian images
of Jesus on his rainbow throne

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
with the Tibetan
images, because we're

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:90%
talking about the same thing.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.260 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about Jesus as a
mortal being who turned himself

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:84%
into a being of light and
ascended into the heavens

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and will return the
same way he left.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:84%
What if we're talking about
him leaving and returning

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
through a stargate
or a wormhole?

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's exactly
what we're talking about.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And our times is
the time when we're

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:middle line:90%
going to see this manifest.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So here again,
another Tibetan image

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of the being who's
achieved the rainbow body.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Notice the ring
surrounding his body.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Is that a symbol of the
stargate or wormhole

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that he has opened
through his body?

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that's exactly what
we're talking about here.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Another image.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the
rainbow body being

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.100 align:middle line:84%
with the gateway
surrounding his body.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, the stargate is
indicated in this artwork.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Over and over
again, the Tibetans

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.730 align:middle line:84%
tell us that the human body
is an intermediate form.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to
transform ourselves

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.980 align:middle line:84%
into a next level being to
achieve the rainbow body.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:84%
The Christian tradition calls
it the Resurrection body

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:84%
or the glory body, and
we're assured that we all

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:84%
have the capability
of manifesting

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:84%
this body in the
Tibetan tradition.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Tibetans
believe that just

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
seeing these revered
images, these sacred images,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.230 align:middle line:84%
speaks to us at a very
deep level, which tells us

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that this is one way we begin
to connect with our rainbow

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.890 align:middle line:84%
body, our glory body, our
Resurrection body is simply

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:84%
by connecting with this
extraordinary artwork.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:84%
What I've been doing is
comparing the Tibetan images

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow body with
the Christian images

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of the resurrected Jesus, who
is portrayed either on a rainbow

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:90%
or in a rainbow.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the Tibetan
Lama in the rainbow ring

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:84%
compared with Jesus
as a Christ angel

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:84%
in a painting by the
Renaissance artist Giotto.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.690 align:middle line:84%
You can see they're
a perfect match.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the winged angel
who is in the rainbow ring.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And within the rainbow ring
is additional concentric rings

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:90%
that are filled with stars.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.260 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, we're looking
at a stargate or a wormhole.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the resurrected
being, the rainbow body being,

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
who is traveling through
that stargate or wormhole.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary
possibility

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about here,
this matching of the Christian

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and the Tibetan tradition,
because they both

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:84%
tell us the same
thing, that we are

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
morphing or transforming

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:90%
into these higher beings.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And in this case we're
talking about making

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
this transformation happen by
beginning to study this artwork

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and to connect with our
rainbow body in this way.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
what we're looking

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:84%
at what we see the
rainbow ring is

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in fact the stargate
or the wormhole.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about an
interstellar transportation

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:84%
system that these
advanced beings utilize.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And modern science
is now beginning

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to catch up with this
ancient tradition.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So when I see Jesus in his
Resurrection body or his glory

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:84%
body is shown here
in this painting

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
by William Holman Hunt, I know
that what's happening here

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
is he has transformed
himself into a being of light

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:84%
and is now capable of accessing
the stargates or wormholes that

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:90%
permeate the galaxy.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:26.440 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing here is
the Tibetan rainbow body

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:10%
next to Jesus and his glory
body in a stained glass

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:10%
that's in the Knights Templar
chapel at the George Washington

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:10%
Freemasonic Memorial
in Washington DC.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:10%
We see the clear
correspondence between Jesus

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:10%
manifesting this glory
body or rainbow body

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.670 align:middle line:10%
and how it matches with
the Tibetan tradition.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back
and match these images

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:90%
with those of the seraphim.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Remember the seraphim.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Look at their bodies now.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember their
vortex shaped bodies

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and how they appeared to
be swirling energy beings.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Now let's compare those swirling
vortex bodies of the seraphim

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
with the swirling bodies of the
Tibetan rainbow body tradition.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.480 align:middle line:90%
We have a perfect match.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.540 align:middle line:84%
What I'm proposing to
you is that the seraphim

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and the beings who've
achieved the rainbow body

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.180 align:middle line:90%
are in fact the same beings.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:84%
The seraph being, the beings
of pure light and pure love,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
are in fact beings
who have manifested

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the next level of human
manifestation, the rainbow

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
the Tibetan artwork

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Judeo-Christian
artwork of the seraphim match

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is because they are in
fact the same beings.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, I'm
asking you to consider

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why Jesus
is portrayed in the rainbow

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:84%
is because he too has
achieved the rainbow

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.500 align:middle line:90%
body, or the Resurrection body.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:84%
There's an extraordinary
story about a figure named

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Enoch in the Old Testament
times that explicitly describes

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
the transformation
of a human, which

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:02.830 align:middle line:84%
blurs the boundaries between
human and angelic existence.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said to Michael,
take Enoch and strip him

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of his earthly garments, and
anoint him with the holy oil,

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and clothe him in
garments of glory.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And Michael stripped
me of my garments,

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and anointed me with the holy
oil, and I looked at myself

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was one of
the glorious ones,

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and there was no difference.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:25.200 align:middle line:84%
This story is explicitly
describing this transformation

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of Enoch into one of these
radiant shining beings.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe he's talking
about his transformation

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
into the rainbow body, just
like what Jesus achieved

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:84%
through his crucifixion
and glorification.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
possibility that each of us

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
have to transform
into these beings.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.070 align:middle line:10%
And what my work
has been about is

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:10%
collecting this artwork
and imagery that

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:10%
shows this transformation,
especially how it relates

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:10%
to the idea of the
stargate or wormhole,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:10%
and how we all have the
capability of manifesting

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:10%
this light body, or
this rainbow body.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that is the
very basis for all

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:90%
of myth and sacred tradition.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:90%
We have it within us.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.755 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do is
to begin to activate it.

00:37:09.755 --> 00:37:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating that
some compare Enoch

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to Elijah, who ascended
into the heavens

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
in a whirlwind that
encircled his body.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:84%
According to the Zohar,
a Jewish sacred text,

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Enoch radiates the divine
Shekhina, the divine rainbow.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It's apparent to us that
the transformation of Enoch

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
into his shining body,
or his radiant body,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.310 align:middle line:84%
is a story of him
achieving the rainbow body.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, Enoch is
another model for us

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:84%
for achieving this
transformation.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the story of
Enoch, he is given

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:84%
a crown resembling
the crown worn by God.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
A heavenly herald proclaims
that from then on his name

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:84%
would no longer be
Enoch but Metatron.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
God then wrote the mystical
secrets of creation

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.720 align:middle line:90%
on Enoch's crown.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.630 align:middle line:84%
"Immense energy,
beautiful sparks,

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and fire emanated from
him," says 3 Enoch

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.720 align:middle line:84%
His material body turned
into celestial fire.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Flesh, veins, bones,
all metamorphosed

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:90%
into glorious flame.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:90%
He became a seraphim.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The reason why Enoch's
story is so important

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
is because earlier we
mentioned the Mormon belief

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that the center of
our Milky Way galaxy

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is inhabited by perfected
humans, righteous humans.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was
the city of Enoch

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
was translated from Earth
into the heavenly realms.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And in my view,
what they're telling

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.220 align:middle line:84%
us is that this is
a group of beings

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
who have achieved the great
perfection, the rainbow body,

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and were therefore translated to
the center of the galaxy, where

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
they may be presently
still dwell.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They became seraphs or
rainbow body beings,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:39:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and it is they will
be returning in 2012.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to talk for a moment
about the Maya symbolism

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.220 align:middle line:90%
of 2012.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.680 align:middle line:10%
What we're looking at here
is a Mixtec or Mayan diagram

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:10%
of the sacred tree, which is how
the Mayans viewed our alignment

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:10%
with the center of
our Milky Way galaxy.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:10%
What we see are two priests
on either side of this tree.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:10%
Their hands are extended,
because they're beaming energy

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:10%
to it or receiving
energy from it.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is an
energetic alignment

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:90%
with the center of the galaxy.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:84%
The sacred tree is shaped like
a T, and it's topped by a bird.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.950 align:middle line:84%
This is important
Mayan symbolism,

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:84%
because what they tell us
is that this sacred tree,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:84%
this t-shaped tree
actually represents

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit,
which they called Ik,

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning the spirit,
the breath, the life.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
this alignment is in fact

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:84%
an infusion of this
higher vibrational

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:90%
energy, this Holy Spirit.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, the Mayans tell
us that this t-shaped tree also

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:84%
represents a portal or a
gateway into other dimensions.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So when we add to all of this
together, what it's telling

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
us is that our alignment
with the center of the galaxy

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.230 align:middle line:84%
is an infusion of this higher
vibrational sacred energy,

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and it is also the opening
of a portal or a gateway

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:90%
into the center of the galaxy.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.700 align:middle line:84%
This is important to
us because-- let's

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.900 align:middle line:84%
establish we put a
tree on the table

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:84%
here in terms of
our conversation.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.010 align:middle line:84%
What the Mayans say is
going to happen in 2012

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is that the center of
the galaxy will open,

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and from out of that opening
in the galactic center

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:84%
will emerge what they described
as a serpent rope, shown here,

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
portrayed almost like an
umbilical cord of sorts.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Riding upon this serpent
rope is the figure

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans called Quetzalcoatl,
who is the Mayan savior.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.590 align:middle line:10%
And this is the whole Maya
2012 prophecy in a nutshell

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:10%
here, that the center
of the galaxy will open,

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.680 align:middle line:10%
and from out of it will
come this umbilical cord,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:10%
and riding upon it is the
Mayan savior Quetzalcoatl.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.810 align:middle line:10%
What my friend and
colleague John Major Jenkins

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:10%
did-- who is a noted
Mayan scholar--

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:10%
is he took out the archaic
Mayan term serpent rope

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:10%
and inserted a modern
word, wormhole,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.410 align:middle line:10%
and came to this question
that, hey, maybe what we're

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:10%
talking about here for
the Maya 2012 prophecy

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.450 align:middle line:10%
is the opening of a
stargate or a wormhole

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:10%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.630 align:middle line:10%
A cosmic transportation system.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:10%
And emerging from that will
be this Mayan savior figure,

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.940 align:middle line:10%
Quetzalcoatl.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.700 align:middle line:10%
I think that's an
extraordinary possibility,

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.890 align:middle line:10%
and when we begin to look
out into our culture,

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:10%
look into our civilization,
we find movies,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.850 align:middle line:10%
we find television
shows, we even

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.370 align:middle line:10%
find commercials showing us
this idea of the stargate

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:10%
or wormhole and
how it is affecting

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.260 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness at this time.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:10%
What we're looking at
here is a comparison

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.000 align:middle line:10%
of the Maya diagram of the
center of the galaxy opening

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.020 align:middle line:10%
and Quetzalcoatl emerging with
a painting by a Buddhist painter

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.440 align:middle line:10%
named Kano Hogai,
who shows the goddess

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Quan Yin, who also corresponds
with the center of the galaxy,

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.090 align:middle line:10%
holding a rod or a
wand in her hand.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Attached to that rod
or wand is a string,

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of the string
is a golden glowing orb

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.230 align:middle line:84%
with a baby soul
inside the golden orb.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.590 align:middle line:84%
We notice that there's
an umbilical cord that

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:90%
wraps around that baby.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:84%
As we follow the
path of that cord

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:84%
we see that it goes to a
craggy, rocky area, which

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Kano Hogai says
represents Earth.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Here is a perfect correspondence
between the Maya concept

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
of the center of the galaxy
opening, a serpent rope

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or umbilical cord emerging
as a transportation

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
system for Quetzalcoatl and a
Buddhist depiction of a baby

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.380 align:middle line:84%
soul emerging from the
center of the galaxy

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and riding a similar
umbilical cord to Earth.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary
correspondence

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about here, and tells us

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps both
of these traditions

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.060 align:middle line:84%
have a shared
tradition of our souls

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.050 align:middle line:84%
originating in the center
of the galaxy and from time

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to time it opening up and
special figures emerging.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:84%
For the moment, I want you to
compare, or perhaps contrast,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the Maya idea of 2012 with what
we find in Christian end time

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.980 align:middle line:90%
prophecy.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go in the
Book of Revelation

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and look up Chapter
20 Verse 12, you

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:84%
find that that is Judgment
Day in the Christian prophetic

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:84%
That is the end of
the world as far

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:84%
as Christian prophecy
is concerned.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the time when they
see the second coming of Jesus

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:90%
occurring.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever wondered if
God has a sense of humor,

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.070 align:middle line:84%
here is your
evidence right here.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.960 align:middle line:84%
For how is it that the Maya
end time prophecy which

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.130 align:middle line:84%
ends in 2012 so perfectly
corresponds to Revelation

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.480 align:middle line:84%
20:12, the Christian
end time prophecy?

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
That's a remarkable
synchronicity or coincidence

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.490 align:middle line:90%
in my view.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually
read Revelation 20:12,

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.460 align:middle line:84%
you find some
astonishing things.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It says, "I saw the
dead, great and small,

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:84%
stand before the throne,
and the books were opened,

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and another book was opened,
which is the book of life.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And the dead were judged
out of those things which

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:84%
were written in the books
according to their works."

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.030 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about here?

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's break down this
statement, this prophecy.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
think about where

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.564 align:middle line:90%
is the throne of God located.

00:44:39.564 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we're asked

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to consider by these
ancient traditions

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.730 align:middle line:84%
is that our Milky Way galaxy
was thought of as the temple.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So any time you're in myth
or in sacred traditions

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and you see the word temple,
you can, according to them,

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:57.780 align:middle line:84%
insert the word galaxy,
and you have another layer

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
of interpretation
of this symbolism.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
is so interesting,

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because the Maya
over 1,000 years ago

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.880 align:middle line:84%
said that in
December 21, 2012, we

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:84%
would be aligned in a special
way, a rare and special way,

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.470 align:middle line:90%
with the center of the galaxy.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:15.000 align:middle line:84%
With the throne of
Revelation 20:12?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're asking
you to think about here,

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's an incredible
possibility.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So what Revelation 20:12 is
saying is that at that time

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.310 align:middle line:84%
the dead, great and small, will
be standing before the throne.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So then the question becomes,
well, who are the dead?

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Well the answer is, that's us.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in this
tradition, we are not

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:90%
considered to be fully living.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.070 align:middle line:84%
We are not in our
fully ascended state.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.580 align:middle line:84%
We're not fully
flowered human beings.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We haven't actually exceeded
or achieved our full potential.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:50.740 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to view it is
that within our spinal cord

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.710 align:middle line:84%
system, our nervous
system, we all have what

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:90%
are called the chakras.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:84%
They're referred to as
the stairway to heaven.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We count them 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7,

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and we finish the
children's song.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.860 align:middle line:90%
All good children go to Heaven.

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
we want to awaken

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and these energy
centers and fully

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:84%
activate them so that we
become a fully functioning

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.080 align:middle line:90%
human being.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, our culture
keeps us often living down

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.490 align:middle line:84%
at the lower chakras, at the
base level, beneath the spine.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Focused on fear,
focused on worry,

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:84%
focused on some of the baser
or mundane issues of our life,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.980 align:middle line:84%
when what we're
challenged to do is

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to live beyond the
level of the heart.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:84%
The way we can think
about this as that really

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.290 align:middle line:84%
none of our elevators
go to the top.

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like we all get stuck
somewhere up in here,

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.786 align:middle line:84%
and none of us is a fully
functioning human being.

00:46:41.786 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Another way of looking
at this is that we all

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:84%
have in our spinal cord
system this system of chakras

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.730 align:middle line:84%
as they can be
viewed as a candle.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Our spinal cord system is
the candle, our pineal gland,

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.780 align:middle line:84%
the seat of our soul in
the center of our brain

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be
the wick of the candle,

00:46:56.830 --> 00:47:00.250 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is none
of our candles are lit.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
challenge of our time

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.080 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to activate
these higher energy

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.160 align:middle line:90%
centers, to light our candle.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is that if
I can awaken my consciousness

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.350 align:middle line:84%
in this way, then
I can turn to you

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and help you to awaken yours,
and you can help and awaken

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the next person,
and on and on we go.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're trying to
make happen at this time.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we are the
dead who are standing

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:84%
before the throne seeking
to awaken our consciousness,

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:84%
to become fully
functioning human beings.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Our galaxy is the temple.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The center of the
galaxy is the throne.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And we are presently
experiencing

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:43.290 align:middle line:84%
this rare alignment with
the center of the galaxy.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:46.760 align:middle line:84%
When you research the ancient
mystical and sacred traditions,

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.980 align:middle line:84%
you find out that
they knew a lot

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.444 align:middle line:84%
about the center of
our Milky Way galaxy.

00:47:51.444 --> 00:47:53.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you read
the Book of Hebrews

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:84%
it says, "You have come to
Sion, to the heavenly Jerusalem,

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.890 align:middle line:90%
the city of the living God.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.850 align:middle line:84%
You have come to
thousands upon thousands

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.430 align:middle line:90%
of angels in joyful assembly."

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:08.080 align:middle line:84%
What we take from this is
that Sion, which means peace,

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:84%
was the name of the
center of the Milky Way

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.130 align:middle line:84%
galaxy in the
Judeo-Christian tradition.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:18.020 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
possibility for us to explore,

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:84%
because when you go
into Christian art,

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.130 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see some
extraordinary examples

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:27.695 align:middle line:84%
of figures such as
Jesus enthroned in Sion.

00:48:27.695 --> 00:48:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're asking you

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:84%
to consider here is that the
center of the galaxy is Sion,

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is the place
where the enthroned Jesus,

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.010 align:middle line:90%
the enthroned Christ, dwells.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So what do we see
in Christian art

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:90%
when we see the enthroned Jesus?

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we see is him
sitting on a rainbow,

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by heavenly beings.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.910 align:middle line:84%
In this painting here,
we see Sion represented

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.580 align:middle line:84%
in the heavenly realms,
and then down below we

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:84%
see the earthly realm, which
is portrayed as chaotic,

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:84%
in fact, a very
frightening place.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that we're
down here in the earthly realms

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and all the good
stuff we want is

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:90%
up here in the heavenly realms.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we've
got to do is learn

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to climb that stairway to
heaven in order to enter Sion

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and to more powerfully
feel the light of Sion.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Looking at other
examples of Christian art

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that portray the
enthroned Jesus,

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.780 align:middle line:84%
we see that he's always
accompanied by that rainbow,

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and accompanied by these
higher heavenly beings.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when we started to
really grasp this concept here,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.050 align:middle line:90%
we raise a question.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do we get
from Earth to Sion?

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And the idea expressed
by the ancients

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.277 align:middle line:84%
is that we get there by
traveling through gateways.

00:49:42.277 --> 00:49:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going to
talk about in this section here

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:48.620 align:middle line:84%
is how we are able to
open gateways from Earth

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.492 align:middle line:90%
and travel to Sion.

00:49:50.492 --> 00:49:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I should mention here
that the Mormons have deep

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.610 align:middle line:84%
seated beliefs about the
center of our Milky Way galaxy,

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.850 align:middle line:84%
going back into the 1800s,
when we didn't even know--

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.450 align:middle line:84%
or at least when
science didn't even

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.410 align:middle line:84%
know-- there was
a galactic center.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even know we lived
within a galaxy at this time,

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.230 align:middle line:84%
but yet the Mormon belief says
that God's home planet, which

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
they called Kolob, is at the
center of our galaxy, which

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.860 align:middle line:84%
all the other
stars in our galaxy

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
rotate around, something that
scientists have validated

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.750 align:middle line:90%
within the past 10 years.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:25.170 align:middle line:84%
The Mormons teach that the
city of Enoch was raised--

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.780 align:middle line:84%
or the term they used
is translated-- to Kolob

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:32.600 align:middle line:84%
because the citizens
attained perfection.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an
extraordinary teaching,

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.500 align:middle line:84%
because it says that
the people of Kolob

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.390 align:middle line:84%
are actually what they refer
to as righteous humans,

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:43.850 align:middle line:84%
humans who have achieved
the highest human potential.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, they are
literally taken, translated,

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:51.440 align:middle line:84%
transported from Earth to
the center of the galaxy.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And the Mormons teach
they still live there.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Kolob and
Sion are the same place,

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:02.050 align:middle line:84%
because the city of Enoch
was also called Sion.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible,
at least according

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to Mormon belief, that those
people are still there.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.390 align:middle line:84%
They're ascended
humans who dwell

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.640 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
the galaxy, and they

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.530 align:middle line:84%
may be among the people who will
be returning in the post 2012

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.360 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So, let's look at the
Christian perspective

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.590 align:middle line:84%
about these perfected
or righteous beings.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Christians believe
that in the end times,

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Revelation 20:12, the
entire human body of Christ

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:34.300 align:middle line:84%
will be changed to match
the exalted state of Christ

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.710 align:middle line:84%
as he is portrayed
in his kingdom.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.140 align:middle line:84%
This is called mystic
rapture, and the belief

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.145 align:middle line:84%
is that in the
twinkling of an eye,

00:51:41.145 --> 00:51:45.020 align:middle line:84%
our bodies are suddenly going
to be changed or transformed

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:50.150 align:middle line:84%
into a higher state, a finer
state, a perfected state.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So how will we know when we
have achieved that state?

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, coming back
to Christian art,

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:84%
we are given examples of
how Christ is portrayed

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in his exalted state
in his kingdom.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, we will match Christ,
his frequency, his vibration,

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:07.710 align:middle line:90%
in this state.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we see here
is John the Revelator

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.200 align:middle line:84%
opening a hole in
heaven and peering

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:90%
into the throne of Christ.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is Jesus
enthroned on his throne,

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.380 align:middle line:84%
perhaps in the
center of the galaxy,

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and we notice that he is
surrounded by rainbows.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.365 align:middle line:84%
This is the traditional
way that Christians portray

00:52:27.365 --> 00:52:31.010 align:middle line:84%
the enthroned Christ and
therefore how they portray

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.080 align:middle line:84%
the throne of perhaps
the center of our galaxy.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at a
couple examples here

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.970 align:middle line:84%
of the enthroned Christ as
he is portrayed on a rainbow.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we see
half the rainbow,

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.770 align:middle line:84%
but we are assured
that it's actually

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:49.130 align:middle line:84%
a 360 degree rainbow,
a full circle.

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So he's on the rainbow
in his higher state,

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:57.220 align:middle line:84%
in his higher vibration,
enfolded within the rainbow.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:01.380 align:middle line:84%
What I started noticing is that
the way Christianity portrays

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Jesus on the throne has
a dramatic connection

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to some other sacred traditions
of the world as well.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And once again as we
look at this painting

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.590 align:middle line:84%
we are seeing Jesus
enthroned, and we

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.970 align:middle line:84%
are down here on
the earthly realm

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to make that journey from
Earth into the heavenly realms.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this
NASA image for a moment

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.140 align:middle line:84%
about the center of
our Milky Way galaxy.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a 400 by 900 light year
mosaic of several Chandra x-ray

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.810 align:middle line:84%
images of the central
region of our Milky Way,

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:84%
the holy of holies, the place
where the throne is located.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And what we see
is that NASA here

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is showing the center
of the Milky Way galaxy

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in the colors red,
green, and blue.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.950 align:middle line:84%
These are the colors
of the rainbow.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this could be a
simple coincidence

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that the center of our
galaxy appears like a rainbow

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and so does the
throne of Christ,

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.210 align:middle line:84%
or it could be further evidence
that we're being shown here

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're on the right track.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.470 align:middle line:84%
That the throne
that we're seeking,

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:03.750 align:middle line:84%
the throne that we're
seeking to connect with

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.580 align:middle line:84%
is in fact the rainbow throne
at the center of our galaxy.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.010 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at
here is another NASA image

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.070 align:middle line:84%
of a black hole
similar to the one

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:84%
at the center of our galaxy,
spilling a kaleidoscope

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:20.680 align:middle line:84%
of color-- red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, and purple.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:27.060 align:middle line:10%
This idea of our galaxy opening
and a higher dimensional being,

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:10%
a higher vibrational being,
traveling back and forth

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.510 align:middle line:10%
from the center of
the galaxy to earth

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.540 align:middle line:10%
is not original to the Mayans.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.580 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the
Judeo-Christian tradition

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.420 align:middle line:10%
talks about it as well.

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.650 align:middle line:84%
In the 14th Century,
Russian icon makers

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:46.540 align:middle line:84%
were suddenly inspired to start
portraying these last judgment

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.430 align:middle line:90%
scenes.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And what they show is the
earthly realm at the lower

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.210 align:middle line:84%
zone of this painting
and connecting Earth

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:56.050 align:middle line:84%
with the throne of
God is a serpent

00:54:56.050 --> 00:55:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that we see traveling
upwards along a central axis.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Where did the Russians
get this idea?

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows for sure,
but what they tell us

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:08.440 align:middle line:84%
in their writings
about this serpent that

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.680 align:middle line:84%
connects Earth and
Heaven is that it

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.025 align:middle line:84%
has 21 toll booths
along the way.

00:55:14.025 --> 00:55:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Are these are some kind of
intermediate star stations

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:19.620 align:middle line:84%
or way stations
along the way that

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.830 align:middle line:84%
link Earth with the
center of the galaxy?

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.960 align:middle line:84%
How else are we supposed to
interpret such symbolism?

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that the
Judeo-Christian tradition

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.300 align:middle line:84%
of the last judgment,
Revelation 20:12,

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.760 align:middle line:84%
perfectly matches
in its iconography

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:47.410 align:middle line:84%
with the Maya tradition of
what I call stargate 2012.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about connecting
with the light of Sion.

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Earlier I talked
about how the ancients

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.340 align:middle line:84%
had a Milky Way
based metaphysics.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.080 align:middle line:84%
When we go into the Talmud
we read, she, the Milky Way,

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.020 align:middle line:84%
was the spirit of God that
hovered over the water

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.200 align:middle line:90%
like a dove.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at this
image of the Milky Way

00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:09.110 align:middle line:84%
we see the body of the bird in
the center, the galactic core,

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:12.450 align:middle line:84%
with the wings of the bird
symbolized or being represented

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.970 align:middle line:90%
by the wings of the galaxy.

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.050 align:middle line:84%
In the Talmud, it
further says she

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.480 align:middle line:90%
spread her wings over her young.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So if the galaxy is the spirit
we're talking about here,

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.570 align:middle line:84%
then her young would be
all the stars and planets

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.020 align:middle line:90%
within the Milky Way galaxy.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So what I encourage you
to do is when we go back

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at
Christian art and we

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.700 align:middle line:84%
see depictions such as
the Annunciation of Mary,

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.040 align:middle line:84%
when the Holy
Spirit descends, we

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.650 align:middle line:84%
see the dove representing
the Holy Spirit

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and we see it hovering
just above Mary's head.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:50.050 align:middle line:84%
In these depictions Mary is
indicated as an ascended being,

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.980 align:middle line:90%
as a highly trained initiate.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We know this because she
has a nimbus or a halo

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:84%
around her head and the
dove is within that halo.

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:03.150 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing here Mary's
alignment or attunement

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:06.930 align:middle line:84%
with the cosmic energies coming
from the center of the galaxy

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and being symbolized
here by the dove.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
at the baptism of Jesus

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.230 align:middle line:90%
by John the Baptist.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.690 align:middle line:84%
We see John and Jesus
and the River Jordan.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We see the dove descending
from the cosmic realms.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We see the dove within
the rainbow ring.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:26.400 align:middle line:84%
We also notice that there is an
angel standing beside Jesus who

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.460 align:middle line:84%
has a cloak in her hand,
who is prepared to hand

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.300 align:middle line:90%
that cloak to Jesus.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at
that cloak in a moment.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's just
follow the descent

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:37.800 align:middle line:84%
of the dove in these
various Christian depictions

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.690 align:middle line:84%
here, because what we are
seeing is a representation

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:44.480 align:middle line:84%
of the light of Sion
descending from the cosmos

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.190 align:middle line:90%
into the earth plane.

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Here the heavens
are tearing open.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.740 align:middle line:84%
We see a beam of light,
almost like a laser beam,

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.040 align:middle line:84%
descended from that
tear in Heaven.

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.350 align:middle line:84%
The beam of light
is traced directly

00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:00.260 align:middle line:84%
into the open crown
chakra of Mary.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Once again we see the dove.

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It's lit up, it's radiant.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.910 align:middle line:84%
We see the beam of
light, and we see

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:10.390 align:middle line:84%
it descending right into a
jewel on top of Mary's head.

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:14.300 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that she has
attained higher awareness.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:17.150 align:middle line:84%
She has opened up her higher
energy centers, her higher

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.610 align:middle line:84%
cosmic awareness,
her crown chakra,

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and is prepared to receive
these energies from Sion.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the
archangel Gabriel, also

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.500 align:middle line:84%
with the jewel on
his forehead, and we

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.900 align:middle line:84%
notice as we look at Gabriel
that the feather coming

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.730 align:middle line:84%
from that jewel is shaped
sort of like a serpent.

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:39.290 align:middle line:84%
What we have here actually
is a feathered serpent.

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That again is the
name of Quetzalcoatl,

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.570 align:middle line:84%
the feathered serpent,
or the seraph.

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we learn
that Gabriel is in fact

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.170 align:middle line:84%
a seraph in the
Judeo-Christian tradition.

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
depiction of the descent

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:55.050 align:middle line:84%
of the dove, this cosmic
energy from the galaxy.

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:59.680 align:middle line:84%
We see it spewing energy into
Mary's awakened consciousness.

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.600 align:middle line:84%
We see the concentric
rings surrounding

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.290 align:middle line:90%
her symbolizing a gateway.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We see something similar here
in this Annunciation scene

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.450 align:middle line:90%
from the Pantheon in Rome.

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:10.670 align:middle line:90%
The dove descends.

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a radiant dove.

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Its conducted by Gabriel, who
has a rod or wand in her hand.

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:19.000 align:middle line:84%
She's portrayed as a male
sometimes, other times

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.050 align:middle line:90%
as a female.

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And she is conducting that
cosmic energy, once again,

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:25.350 align:middle line:84%
into the awakened
consciousness of Mary.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But now note in
this instance she

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.330 align:middle line:84%
is enfolded within
a rainbow halo,

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:32.640 align:middle line:84%
an aura of rainbow
colored light.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.880 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is telling
us that she is actually

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.980 align:middle line:84%
receiving this
higher energy, and it

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.690 align:middle line:84%
is helping her to
achieve the rainbow body.

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We see the exact same thing
here in this Annunciation scene.

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel with the rod or wand
conducting the cosmic energy

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.560 align:middle line:84%
into the awakened
consciousness of Mary,

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.170 align:middle line:84%
symbolized by the
concentric rings,

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:54.310 align:middle line:90%
again in a rainbow color.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:57.190 align:middle line:84%
She is attuning herself
with these higher energies

00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, and
it is helping her

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the rainbow
body or human perfection.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.080 align:middle line:84%
What is actually
happening here is

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that Gabriel is conducting
this cosmic energy

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:10.760 align:middle line:90%
into the pineal gland of Mary.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.660 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier
about the chakras.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.410 align:middle line:90%
We counted them.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:18.820 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all
good children go to Heaven.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.830 align:middle line:84%
The sixth chakra, also
called the third eye,

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes the
pineal gland, and it

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is the pineal gland
that is the receptor

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.050 align:middle line:90%
for these cosmic energies.

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:31.950 align:middle line:10%
This is a photograph from
an electron microscope

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:35.690 align:middle line:10%
of the calcite micro crystals
in the human pineal gland.

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't know
is that our pineal gland which

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
is called the seat of
the soul and is located

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
our brain is dotted

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.300 align:middle line:90%
with crystalline geometry.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It is actually a
wireless transmitter.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It is actually the
cell phone industry

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that is doing the most
intensive research right now

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
on the human pineal gland,
because they know ultimately

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
our cellphones will be
taken out of our hands

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and will be put
inside of our body,

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
specifically inside
our pineal gland,

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
utilizing the calcite
micro crystals as tuners

01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:11.450 align:middle line:90%
for cellphone communication.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the ancients already

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.960 align:middle line:84%
knew about the secrets
of the pineal gland

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to
receive, perhaps,

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
off-world transmissions,
even those coming

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
the Milky Way galaxy?

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's
exactly what they knew,

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is why in
instance after instance

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
of this Judeo-Christian
art, we see figures being

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
attuned with cosmic
energies and that energy

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is being specifically
directed towards

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the awakened consciousness and
specifically the pineal gland.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
This extraordinary painting is
by [? Meran ?] [? Seralian ?]

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's called The
Opening of the Third Eye.

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It shows the head of Minerva,
the goddess of ancient Rome

01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:51.320 align:middle line:84%
who's equivalent to
the Greek goddess

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And what it shows in part is the
activities of the pineal gland

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary
body at the time

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
of the opening of the third eye.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual energy, the
Kundalini fire, the sacred fire

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:08.200 align:middle line:84%
is seen rising upward
through the spinal canal

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.940 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of a dove.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The pineal is shown
radiating a blue aura.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
would be happening

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
inside the skull or the brain
of Mary in these Annunciation

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
scenes where she is
receiving the higher

01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:24.750 align:middle line:90%
energies of the cosmos.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
She is activating the
latent capabilities

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
of her pineal gland and
is now able to operate

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
at a much higher level
as a human being.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
This idea of the
galactic core being

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
the source of these
energies was well

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
known to the ancients,
especially the Greeks

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.180 align:middle line:90%
and the Egyptians.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Greeks said the
rainbow symbolized the goddess

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Iris, the source of the waters
on high, the mother of love.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the Milky Way to
the ancient Egyptians,

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
who called her Isis.

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Like the part of
the named after her,

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Iris was the core or the virgin.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So in this depiction from
the National Cathedral

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
in Washington DC, we see the
eye above radiating the rainbow

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
light, and we see Jesus
meditating on the Trinity.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
In my view, what
it's portraying is

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' alignment with
the energies coming

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.015 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
the Milky Way galaxy,

01:03:21.015 --> 01:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and it represents his
awakening consciousness.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:28.115 align:middle line:10%
If the galaxy is in
fact the all-seeing eye,

01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:31.880 align:middle line:10%
it gives new life to
interpretations of such symbols

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.830 align:middle line:10%
as the Great Seal of
the United States,

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:38.800 align:middle line:10%
the all-seeing eye on the
back of the one dollar bill,

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.400 align:middle line:10%
on the Great Seal
of the United States

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.150 align:middle line:10%
could in fact represent the
center of our Milky Way galaxy

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:48.420 align:middle line:10%
and the radiant eye is
the eye of illumination,

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.320 align:middle line:10%
the eye of awakened
consciousness

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.420 align:middle line:10%
and it is apprehended
by those who

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.440 align:middle line:10%
understand that the
symbolism actually

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.590 align:middle line:10%
represents the Milky Way's core.

01:03:57.590 --> 01:04:03.800 align:middle line:90%


01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I recently heard Alex
Jones say, the war

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
for human liberty against
total dehumanization is on now,

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and what we are facing
is a complete disaster

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
if we are in fact dehumanized.

01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:19.660 align:middle line:10%
Part of what he's talking about
is the march of technology

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:23.680 align:middle line:10%
to transform us into cyborgs,
to take our technology

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.020 align:middle line:10%
and put it underneath our skin.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.210 align:middle line:10%
But in fact the ancients
knew a lot about liberty,

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:31.510 align:middle line:10%
and they talked
about true liberty

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:35.200 align:middle line:10%
as being a time when we
connect with cosmic energy

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.990 align:middle line:10%
or cosmic power that
the Gnostics called

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:41.080 align:middle line:10%
exousia, which means the power.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Exousia is a Greek word
that means the power,

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
it means jurisdiction, liberty,
capacity, and strength.

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.420 align:middle line:10%
And in the
Judeo-Christian tradition,

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.540 align:middle line:10%
true power was symbolized
by a robe or a garment

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:56.390 align:middle line:10%
of light that was called
the robe of glory,

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:59.220 align:middle line:10%
the seamless garment,
the garment of light,

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.560 align:middle line:10%
or the term I prefer,
the beaming garment.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.920 align:middle line:10%
This is the garment
that was worn by Jesus

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.950 align:middle line:10%
and demonstrated by him at
the Transfiguration, when

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:10.780 align:middle line:10%
he took several disciples
up to the top of a mountain

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.990 align:middle line:10%
and pulled back his skin
and revealed himself

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.410 align:middle line:10%
as a being of light.

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
How did Jesus get this cosmic
power, this beaming garment,

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.550 align:middle line:90%
this garment of light?

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
The answer is he received
it at the baptism

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.400 align:middle line:90%
by John the Baptist.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
As the Book of Mark says, "It
came to pass in those days

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus came from
Nazareth of Galilee

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and was baptized
of John in Jordan.

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And straight away coming
up out of the water,

01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
he saw the heavens torn
open and the spirit

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
like a dove
descending upon him."

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Here again we're talking about a
story in which the heavens open

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and a cosmic vibration
symbolized by the dove

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.070 align:middle line:90%
descends.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
the baptism, Jesus

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is given his beaming
garment or his garment

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
of light, which is what
we see in the hands

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:59.600 align:middle line:90%
of the angel at the baptism.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
this beaming garment

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.195 align:middle line:84%
is that we discover as we
follow its myths and lore

01:06:04.195 --> 01:06:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and tradition is that it's
likely, A, that the energy

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
for it came from the center
of the Milky Way galaxy

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and, B, this energy, this
vibration of true liberty

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.009 align:middle line:90%
is in fact transmittable.

01:06:17.009 --> 01:06:17.550 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
The beating garment,
the robe of glory,

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.850 align:middle line:90%
is a transmittable garment.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:25.730 align:middle line:10%
It can be given from one
person to another person,

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.380 align:middle line:10%
and this is what
we see happening

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.580 align:middle line:10%
in the Transfiguration.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.170 align:middle line:10%
As I researched the history
of the beaming garment,

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.010 align:middle line:10%
I follow the path of Jesus
up the mount of Tabor,

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:36.970 align:middle line:10%
the mount of transfiguration.

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The disciples, we see them here
at the base of the mountain,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.950 align:middle line:90%
they're terrified.

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:41.940 align:middle line:90%
They're in great pain.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
They're like many of
the people that we

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
know in this world today who
are looking for something more,

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
but don't know quite
how to achieve it.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus takes the disciples
up to the mountain,

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and reveals himself as
this beam being of light.

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.170 align:middle line:90%
He puts on the beaming garment.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice
in these depictions

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is that behind him
is an open gateway.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk for a
moment about how

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.130 align:middle line:90%
this garment is transmitted.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Iran,
the beaming garment

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
was said to come
from Vahu Mano, who

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is a conductor of the souls
of the righteous men to Ahura

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Mazda, the high god
of the Zoroastrians.

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Vahu Mano introduces the soul to
Ahura Mazda, the god of light.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
He is a helper, a
companion, and a guide.

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It is at this
meeting that the soul

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is invested with a
white and pure garment.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The Indo-Iranian concept
of the garment of light

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
was taken up by Christians
in the Gnostic tradition

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and referred to as
the beaming garment.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
This companion that gives
us the beaming garment

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is the same companion that
stays in the galactic center

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Gnostic tradition.

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And taking us back to
Thomas Cole's painting

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
where we see the
baby soul on its boat

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
emerging from the source place
with the messenger of light,

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
we see that that is the
source of this garment.

01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So maybe in a way
John the Baptist

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
is fulfilling the role
of Jesus' higher self.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
He is attuning him to
these higher vibrations

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:08.830 align:middle line:90%
of the center of the galaxy.

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
The angel waits to give him
his beaming garment or garment

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of light.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.220 align:middle line:84%
In these depictions of
the Transfiguration,

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
we see that Jesus is a
radiant or star being.

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:22.399 align:middle line:84%
His body has turned to
light, and behind him

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.979 align:middle line:90%
is this open gateway.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
As I look at this
imagery and compare it

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
with what we saw earlier, I'm
thinking that what we're seeing

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.420 align:middle line:84%
is he's opening up a
stargate or a wormhole.

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.479 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, at
the Transfiguration

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.270 align:middle line:90%
the disciples are terrified.

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:40.550 align:middle line:84%
While Jesus spoke with
them a bright cloud

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
cast a shadow over them.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.609 align:middle line:84%
God spoke from the
cloud, and terrified

01:08:44.609 --> 01:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
the disciples fell
prostrate, but Jesus

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
came and touch
their souls, saying,

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.939 align:middle line:90%
rise, and do not be afraid.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Rise, and do not be afraid.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
That is the message
of our times.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.859 align:middle line:84%
It is time for us to raise our
vibration, to overcome fear,

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:03.200 align:middle line:90%
and to seek our higher self.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It is time for us to
seek our higher self,

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
to rise and not be afraid, to
put on that beaming garment,

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and to open that
gateway to ourselves.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Early Christians were
actually divine alchemists

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
who believed that the human body
could be transmuted into light,

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and they adopted the
concept that the panel

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
icons such as these that
we've just been looking at

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
were actually portals or
gateways into the higher

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
dimensional realms.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They were taught the icons
were literally mirrors,

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and that by meditating with
these panel icons of Jesus

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Transfiguration, they
believed that our body would

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:46.149 align:middle line:84%
begin to mirror what is
happening in Jesus' body.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, just by
contemplating, meditating

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
on it, and reflecting
upon what is happening

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
in the Transfiguration,
our body begins

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to mirror what Jesus
is experiencing.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
spiritual technology

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about here,
and is a very key way for us

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to begin to engage in this
energy and to connect with it.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is
contemplate, meditate,

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and reflect on the icons
of Transfiguration,

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.672 align:middle line:84%
and our body begins to come
alive with this energy.

01:10:22.672 --> 01:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm
suggesting is that you

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
begin to incorporate these
images into your daily routine.

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
To place them around you in
your home or your office as

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
triggers, as memory
icons for you,

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
so that you begin to
connect with this energy

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and begin to bring
it alive within you.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect
with the energy,

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you too will be doing, what
Jesus is doing here, opening

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the gate full of stars, the
stargate that leads to Sion,

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
the gate to the other
dimensional realm.

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And with this energy flowing
through your body and the gate

01:10:56.570 --> 01:11:01.270 align:middle line:84%
opened, you begin to more and
more reflect your higher self.

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You begin to live a life filled
with more love as opposed

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.940 align:middle line:90%
to fear.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
That is the premise
of soul rising, that

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
is the premise of engaging
with the light of Sion.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It's what we're all called
upon to do at this time

01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:18.360 align:middle line:90%
and all of us can do it.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about here
ultimately is how we ascend.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And ascension
doesn't necessarily

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.620 align:middle line:90%
have to do with dying.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Ascension has to do with
raising the soul's vibration,

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
embracing its highest light
and its highest potentials.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
paintings of ascension

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is by Hieronymus Bosch,
the Flanders painter who

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
lived in Italy and was given
the teachings of the Cathars

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
of Southern France, the pure
ones who claimed that they

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
possessed the secret esoteric
teachings of Jesus and Mary

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And in his paintings,
Bosch shows for us

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.380 align:middle line:90%
the process of ascension.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Here he's showing the
Cathar soul, the pure soul,

01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
rising from the earthly
plane, rising out

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
of the realm of fear,
up into the gateway,

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
the light that leads into Sion.

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
A name for this gateway
or this pillar that

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
is shown in these
paintings is Tzadik.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:14.295 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the ancient
Hebrew names for this pillar,

01:12:14.295 --> 01:12:16.720 align:middle line:90%
and it means righteousness.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that when the
righteous souls in our world,

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
those focused on love and
who have overcome fear, act

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
righteously, then this pillar
linking Earth with Sion

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:28.580 align:middle line:90%
is strengthened.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But if not, the
pillar is weakened.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The soul, if found worthy,
ascends this column of light

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and is given a pass
through the gate to Sion.

01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish Kabbalists tell us
that the faithful and elect

01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
do not practice for themselves
alone, but for the sake

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:47.730 align:middle line:90%
of Heaven, for the sake of Sion.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So as we raise our
soul's vibration,

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
we raise the souls
of all of humanity,

01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
the world, and everything in it.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
promise of our time

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
is that if enough righteous
souls gather together,

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
we can strengthen this pillar,
this gate, this stargate

01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
to Sion, and keep it open for
all the souls of this planet.

01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Hieronymus Bosch
paints it for us

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.496 align:middle line:84%
in his wonderful painting
called Saint Jerome Praying.

01:13:13.496 --> 01:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
In the center of
the painting, we

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
see Jerome praying before a
traditional Catholic image

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.140 align:middle line:90%
of the crucifix.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.560 align:middle line:84%
But then down in the
lower left hand corner,

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
he shows us the column of
glory, the column of Christ,

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
the Christ column, or the
pillar of righteousness.

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And in this column, we
see the perfected soul

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:34.460 align:middle line:90%
rising through a gate of stars.

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
This looks just like what
Gene Roddenberry invented

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
in the series "Star Trek,"
when he talks about beaming.

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Hence the term the
beaming garment,

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.180 align:middle line:84%
because when we put on
this garment of light,

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
we not only glow rays and
actually beam or radiate light,

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
but we also have the
capability of beaming,

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.210 align:middle line:84%
teleportation transportation
through the stargate to Sion.

01:13:57.210 --> 01:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So here in this detail of
Hieronymus Bosch's painting

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
we see the pure soul rising
through a cylinder filled

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.930 align:middle line:84%
with stars, a glassy
cylinder filled

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
with stars, through
several zones

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
into the higher
dimensional realms.

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
He is venturing through
the stargate to Sion

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and makes it through
to the other side.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
That is the hope of our time.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.770 align:middle line:84%
We can follow Jesus'
path, the path of love,

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:24.030 align:middle line:90%
through the gateway to Sion.

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And it begins by doing
something very simple.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It begins by overcoming
fear, by putting away

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that fear, by connecting
with other souls

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
on the path of ascension,
raising their vibration

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that the
work we're doing on ourselves

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is helping to raise the
vibration of all on our planet.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You belong to the race of
the perfect light humans.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.780 align:middle line:90%
It is our natural birthright .

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.430 align:middle line:90%
It is who we are.

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
remember who we are.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I would like to thank
you for watching.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And in closing,
I would just like

01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:03.185 align:middle line:84%
to ask you to put away the
fear, to raise your vibration,

01:15:03.185 --> 01:15:06.050 align:middle line:84%
because the work you're doing
on yourself is helping you,

01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's also helping
everyone in this world.

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you are part
of the eternal race

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.070 align:middle line:90%
of the perfect light humans.

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
That is who we are,
and this is a process

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
of remembering, and recalling,
and joining together

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
with all are on this path.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Use the artwork of
ascension on your path.

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Its message is simple.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
We can awaken these
abilities within us

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.230 align:middle line:90%
just by looking at the art.

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It's talking to us
at a very deep level,

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and its message is simple.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.446 align:middle line:90%
You are doing the work now.

01:15:39.446 --> 01:15:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much for watching.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
