00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen
is that the signal

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:90%
would go to a base station.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:10%
And then, as long as you were
within the cell, on your phone,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.299 align:middle line:10%
that cell tower would
be handling your call.

00:16:46.299 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
moved into another cell,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
it would hand off the signal
to the next cell tower.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:10%
And that required
an infrastructure

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:10%
so that there's always a
transmission-and-reception loop

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:10%
between the cell phone and the
infrastructure or the closest

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:10%
base station.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
That's also how the base
station knows where you are.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:10%
If you have good
signals in Maryland

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:10%
but you don't have good
signals in Virginia,

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:10%
Maryland would have a commercial
advantage in business.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It's about fairness.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And, when you go back
to our Constitution,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:84%
the Commerce Clause is one
of the big fairness clauses.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So it became a federal
program to build out

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:90%
the infrastructure.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
That was the rationale for
the federal government being

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:84%
able to come in and, in
effect, in some cases step

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
on the rights of
individual citizens,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.609 align:middle line:84%
in order to build out
the infrastructure.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.877 align:middle line:90%
It's our system.

00:17:54.877 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone told us, you're
not going to be able to win.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:90%
You're not able to fight.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can do.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%
It's going up.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.949 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself, if
and when it does go up I

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
want to be able to look at it
and at least say to myself,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:90%
I tried.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> We had, like, 10 days, so--

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I ran around for
a week, couple hours a night,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.721 align:middle line:90%
trying to get signatures.

00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Then we got enough to go to City
Hall, get our foot in the door.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:10%
>> My message was that if
these cell towers were not safe

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:10%
enough for the fire department
to have them where they live

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:10%
and work, then why is it safe
enough to have near 3,000

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:10%
children who go to school and
live in the immediate area.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
That's how it came to pass that
we were able to stop the tower.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I live and breathe
by this technology.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to watch something
while stuck in the car.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to justify
being stuck in traffic

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and call my mom or
grandma on the phone.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a typical human thing,
that we have new technology,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
we get very excited about it, we
use it, we push it really far,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and it has great applications.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
However, many of
those often come

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:90%
with health considerations.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, once those
become more evident

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to the general population,
then we hopefully

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
force the government
and scientists

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to come up with a safer way
of using that technology.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Today our world is
being remade, yet again,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
by an information revolution,
changing the way we work,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.836 align:middle line:84%
the way we live, the way
we relate to each other.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
With the stoke of
a pen, our laws

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.671 align:middle line:90%
will catch up with our future.

00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1995 and 1996, we
began the process of a new

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:10%
telecommunications.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:10%
And the Telecommunications Act,
now, was, for the first time,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:10%
written to put the FCC in the
role of a policing agency.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But the FCC's job,
as a commission,

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
was fair and equitable
use of spectrum.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:84%
The FCC was not a policing
agency, had nothing

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to do with safety, had nothing
to do with monitoring-- only

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the different
phone companies didn't

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:90%
cheat each other.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
That's an important
point, because it

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:84%
was the industry that lobbied
to have those changes made.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Recognizing the
regulatory void that existed,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the cellular industry
strategically positioned itself

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
to be influential in the kind
of research the government would

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:90%
be carrying out on its products.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So the wireless industry
agreed to put up money from

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:90%
the cell-phone industry.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And an interagency working group
of the United States government

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:84%
was put in place to
oversee the work.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
That project was called the
WTR, or Wireless Technology

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Research.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:10%
And that's the program that I
ran, looking into the health

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:10%
effects of wireless technology.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Ordinarily, in a
regulatory context,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
new technologies would be tested
extensively before they reached

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
the marketplace, in order
to make sure that they

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
didn't present any
dangers to consumers.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:84%
In the case of cell phones,
and the wireless industry

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, this crucial
stage was bypassed.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
This meant the
regulatory agencies

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.851 align:middle line:84%
were forced to rely on
postmarket surveillance.

00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I think the thing that
surprised me most and really

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:10%
kind of caught my attention the
most, which I hadn't realized,

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:10%
is that the manufacturers
actually tell people

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:10%
in the instruction manual,
which I'd never read,

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:10%
not to put the cell
phone against your ear.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The advice in the phone tells
you to keep it off the body,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:10%
because phones are
tested in two positions.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:10%
They are tested next to the
head and next to the body.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
When they're tested
next to the head,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:90%
they're tested with a spacer.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The industry has
succeeded in getting

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
the FCC to accept an approach
where the phone is not

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:90%
used like this.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know that this is
exactly how most people use

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:90%
phones.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We were sort of caught
in a difficult place,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:84%
because some of the claims that
were being made about health

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
effects were so severe that, had
there been premarket testing,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
cell phones never would have
made it into the marketplace.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:10%
So what happened was,
through some lobbying efforts

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:10%
and in the Telecommunication
Act when it was finally passed,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:10%
the EPA's RF program
was defunded.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
We didn't like what they were
saying, so let's get rid of it.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.541 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:22:06.541 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> People deserve to
have the right to know.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
The industry wants to
keep the cat in the bag,

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:84%
as long as they possibly
can, that there is harm.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't like the
word "radiation."

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't like
the word "safety."

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:84%
They're against all
of this, because they

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
don't want to alarm
people and, the big thing

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
is, they have no liability
insurance, by Lloyd's of London

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
or Swiss RE, the two
top insurance companies.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> "The main effect on the
insurance industry will concern

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
product liability claims
for bodily injury."

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm involved in this issue
because I love my husband.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.445 align:middle line:10%
Just a few months after Alan had
his diagnosis of a brain tumor,

00:22:51.445 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:10%
I ended up testifying to
the United States Congress

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.373 align:middle line:10%
about it.

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:10%
[GAVEL KNOCKS]

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Today's hearing will examine
what science is saying about

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:10%
the potential links between
long-term use of cell phones

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:10%
and tumors or other
health effects.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I see this from the
public-health perspective

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:10%
as being very, very important
that we urgently need more

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:10%
research.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:10%
We have almost no US-funded
research in this area.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not a scientist.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm a human being,
a mother, a wife.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:10%
I do know, from my research
and from talking with doctors

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.250 align:middle line:10%
and scientists worldwide,
that there are major flaws,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:10%
even in this Interphone study.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:10%
I have in front of me
something right here

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:10%
that says "the
Interphone studies always

find a statistical significant
elevated risk when a cell

phone has been used
for 10 or more years

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:10%
on the same side of the head
where the tumor was found."

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, but I'm
not understanding

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:10%
the lack of correlation, here.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:10%
The FCC is debating the science.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.686 align:middle line:84%
And the FCC is a
captured agency.

00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They're captured by
the telecom industry.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:10%
There's a revolving door
between the telecom industry

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.686 align:middle line:10%
and the FCC.

00:24:10.686 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:84%
There's people that have
worked at the FCC that now

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
work for the telecom industry.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.403 align:middle line:10%
There's people that worked
for the telecom industry that

00:24:16.403 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:10%
are now at the FCC.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:10%
>> When I myself look at
where people go for advice--

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:10%
so, where would I go, as both
a parent and medical doctor?

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I look at the World
Health Organization.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I look at my government and
the education authorities

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and the groups like the
Department of Health.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard
now to find groups

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:90%
who are truly independent.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:84%
All of these groups
receive revenue

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
from the telecommunications
industry.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:10%
>> The wireless industry
spends $100 billion a year,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:10%
lobbying the Congress.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
They have very good
access to the FCC.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's really hard to
go up against the power

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
of this industry, even when you
have the facts on your side.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite the industry attempts
to suppress the findings

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific community,
scientists continue

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:84%
their pioneering research into
the adverse effects from EMF

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:90%
and RF exposures.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We're having a serious
problem with global fertility

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:90%
reducing.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence now that
men who use cell phones,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:90%
they have deformed sperm.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:10%
They have sperm that moves
much more slowly, dies

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:10%
much more quickly.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And all of this is going
to affect their ability

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.330 align:middle line:10%
to successfully
impregnate their partners.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Men who carry their cell
phones in their pockets are

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
carrying them right
next to their testes.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And the sperm cells
are vulnerable.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Girls are born with all
their eggs in an ovary,

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:84%
so it's pretty much
guarded until puberty.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The testes are exposed, in
turn, much more accessible

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:90%
to radiation.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.346 align:middle line:10%
And, as a result,
they get irradiated.

00:25:58.346 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is that, when

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
a spermatocyte
gets irradiated, it

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:90%
keeps on making sperm cells--

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.860 align:middle line:90%
with the mutations.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:10%
>> If there is a genetic
change, a mutation,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:10%
that modification will be
maintained throughout the life

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:10%
of the individual.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Women of reproductive
age should be so careful,

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their exposures,
because they can influence

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the health of their
child even before they

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.300 align:middle line:90%
know that they're pregnant.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The fetus is
programming itself,

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:10%
which means that every cell
of the fetus is getting

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:10%
information from outside--

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:10%
from the environment,
from the mother.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:10%
All these can make a sort of
mismatch in his programming.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the stages of life,
the fetus is by far the most

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's for multiple reasons.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the fetus
is growing cells, rapidly.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:90%
So cells are dividing rapidly.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So, if there is an exposure,
that can influence the fetus

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and can alter the whole lifespan
of the subsequent child.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> When something appears to
be caused by an environmental

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:84%
influence, one ought to figure
out what it would cost to take

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
care of it or to do something to
ameliorate its effects and how

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.800 align:middle line:84%
it compares to what would happen
if we did nothing and we'd have

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to do the cleanup
work afterwards.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And in 2007 we published
the first BioInitiative Report.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And that report is basically
an encyclopedia or a compendium

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of all the science
in public health

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that comes to bear on the
issue of whether EHS--

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and now radio-frequency
radiation--

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact
cancer-causing and are

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a cause of neurological
diseases like Alzheimer's

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and cognitive problems
and developmental problems

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:90%
in children, like autism.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:10%
So scientists
decided it was time

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:10%
to counter the industry claims
that there is no evidence.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the thing is, it
came out, and there were--

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
obviously, there were a number
of people who didn't like it,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.775 align:middle line:84%
because, they
said, first of all,

00:28:14.775 --> 00:28:16.165 align:middle line:90%
it's not an authorized group.

00:28:16.165 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:84%
(LAUGHING) I don't
know what they

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.664 align:middle line:90%
wanted an authorized group.

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
They want a bunch of fat
cats or political characters?

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
These were scientists who
were talking about the stuff

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:90%
that they're working on.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
The BioInitiative
has been criticized,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.926 align:middle line:84%
and it was also
considered pretty good.

00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:33.050 align:middle line:10%
And one of the people who
considered it pretty good

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:10%
was the European Parliament,
who used that as an argument

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:10%
for saying that
one ought to look

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:10%
at the electromagnetic
safety standards.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:10%


00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Today's research struggles
to keep up with technology,

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:10%
as more and more aspects of our
daily lives become dependent

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:10%
on wireless devices.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:84%
This is particularly true
for children, many of whom

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
have known nothing else other
than the age of smartphones

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.486 align:middle line:90%
and tablets.

00:29:02.486 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> A little more
than 10 years ago,

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:90%
my first grandson was born.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.880 align:middle line:10%
And when he was
nine months of age,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:10%
he could find a cell phone,
turn it on, and play a game.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was, of course, very
proud of how smart he was.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But I began to look into what we
know about the developing brain

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and how it is affected
by different things.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I been a CDC advisor
on lead poisoning,

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that
the brain doubled

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
in the first year of life and
that we go to great lengths

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.679 align:middle line:84%
to protect children's
brains from lead poisoning.

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And here we were, exposing
them to something that

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:90%
had never really been tested.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So the more I looked into this,
the more concerned I became.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a number of
barriers in our body to protect

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:90%
important tissues.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have ones in the brain
to protect the brain from toxins

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and bacteria--

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:90%
heavy metals.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And what this means is that
some of the toxic things that

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:10%
can be transported in blood
don't cross into these very

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:10%
sensitive tissues.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.261 align:middle line:90%
So they have barriers.

00:30:00.261 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the brain,
it's called the "blood-brain

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:90%
barrier."

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:84%
In the early work
with microwaves,

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Allan Frey, who was one of the
early workers in this area,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
published a paper where
he found that, when

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:84%
he put a dye into the blood,
shortly after exposure you

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
suddenly found it in the
cerebral spinal fluid.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, what happened is the
blood-brain barrier had leaked.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The blood-brain barrier
leakage is apt to be [LAUGH]

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:84%
a rather important effect, in
terms of the pathology that

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:90%
can result from people.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Because, if you're
going to contaminate

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the environment
of the brain, you

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
can expect all
kinds of odd things

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.080 align:middle line:84%
to be happening on
exposure to EMF.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.060 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The exposures that we
now have are unprecedented.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:10%
I remember a life without
this kind of radiation.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But the children
that we have now

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
are going to view
the internet the way

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:90%
that we view electricity.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll think that
it's just something

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.955 align:middle line:84%
that, of course, is
OK, because they never

00:31:02.955 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
knew life without it.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But, in terms of legislation
to protect children,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the level in classrooms,
in my opinion, should be zero.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We are the second-largest
school district in the nation.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:10%
With the demands of
the school district

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.969 align:middle line:10%
and the demands of getting the
kids into the 21st century,

00:31:38.969 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:10%
the school district-- the board
of education, in particular--

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:10%
asked the office of
environmental health and safety

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:10%
to take a look at wireless
in all its classrooms.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:10%
And so the district,
wanting to move forward

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:10%
with the technology, wanting to
meet the demands of the state

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the testing
that needs to be done,

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:10%
we need to look at how
we can accomplish that.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.939 align:middle line:84%
And certainly Wi-Fi
is really a good fit

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:90%
and a good answer for it.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But, again, we need to look at
that in terms of its safety.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people claim
that, even at very low levels,

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.160 align:middle line:84%
there are adverse health
effects associated

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:84%
with these
radio-frequency exposures.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The particular concern
is when you have a wireless

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:10%
classroom in schools.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:10%
You have one router, and
you have 20 or 30 kids

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:10%
with a wireless laptop.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:84%
That is going to be a really
hot Wi-Fi environment.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And those children are
going to be exposed

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
to that radio-frequency
radiation for as long

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:90%
as they're in that classroom.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The district felt that
we should establish our own

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.696 align:middle line:84%
internal threshold for
acceptable exposure.

00:32:53.696 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And so what we've
done was we've looked

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:10%
at the available
research, and the district

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:10%
has set a threshold
of acceptable exposure

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:10%
at 10,000 times lower than
the current FCC standards.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> 25 years ago, when the
FCC standards were adopted

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
for thermal effects, we didn't
have all of these wireless

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And the impacts on health
weren't epidemiologically

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:10%
visible, which they are today.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So the phase one of
our program rolled out.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
A number of schools
received these end devices.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Access points were installed.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And students began to use them.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> One piece of this is
particularly important,

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and that is the tablet itself.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
These tablets are extremely
high radio-frequency emitters.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.200 align:middle line:10%
They have either three
or four or five antennas

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:10%
built into the areas
where you can hold one.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:10%
When I looked at the
Apple user's guide--

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.450 align:middle line:10%
and if you take the time
to scroll through it,

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:10%
and you look at radio-frequency
radiation issues,

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:10%
there is a paragraph that
will light your hair on fire,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.774 align:middle line:10%
because it says--

00:34:01.774 --> 00:34:04.440 align:middle line:10%
>> "A small percentage of people
may be susceptible to blackouts

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:10%
or seizures.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Discontinue use of iPad
and consult a physician

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.820 align:middle line:84%
if you experience headaches,
blackouts, seizures,

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
convulsion, eye or muscle
twitching, loss of awareness,

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.737 align:middle line:84%
involuntary movement,
or disorientation."

00:34:13.737 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.639 align:middle line:10%
>> We've got an analogy of
a classroom being the inside

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:10%
of a microwave oven
set at very low power.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Children are exposed to that
Wi-Fi radiation six hours,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:84%
every school day, five days a
week, and for several months

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:42.179 align:middle line:84%
during the year,
13 years of school.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:10%
It's a very disturbing
trend that we're setting up

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:10%
by irradiating some of the
youngest and most vulnerable

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:10%
people in our population.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I used to be the Ashland
Education Foundation president.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.590 align:middle line:10%
And I ran seven
different campaigns

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:10%
to bring technology into Ashland
public schools over the years.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.800 align:middle line:84%
We have something in Ashland
public schools called "Best

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Practices for Mobile Devices."

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:84%
In our classrooms, when
we're not using the Wi-Fi

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:90%
we should be turning it off.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:10%
And when we are not
using devices actively,

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:10%
then we should be
turning them off.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:10%
We are the first
public-school district

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:10%
in the nation to address this.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A wired computer classroom
will not expose your child

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:90%
to radio-frequency radiation.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> People have brought this to
our attention and recommended

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:90%
that a wired technology--

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:90%
fiber optic, for example--

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.290 align:middle line:84%
is certainly a better
way to go and might even

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
be more reliable.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:90%
And we understand that.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:10%
But the district,
because of what's

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:10%
happened in 2009, moving forward
to today, with the requirements

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:10%
under the Common Core
program, the testing,

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:10%
and the sheer number of
schools and classrooms,

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:10%
to actually meet the
time line and actually

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:10%
go ahead and put 30 drops
in an individual classroom

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.500 align:middle line:10%
is an unbelievable, daunting
task and, I don't think,

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:10%
logistically possible.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:09.420 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> While hardwired classrooms
would greatly reduce

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.827 align:middle line:84%
children's exposure
to radio frequencies,

00:36:14.827 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
there's still a growing concern
that children are spending too

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:90%
much time in front of screens.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The American
Academy of Pediatrics,

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:10%
their guidelines are, no more
than one to two hours of screen

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:10%
time a day.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:10%
For kids under
three, zero hours.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need to
look at how much of that

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:84%
is interactive screen
time and how much is

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.290 align:middle line:90%
at school, how much is at home.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids become addicted
to their signals.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can go
into a nice restaurant,

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and there are four people
sitting at a table,

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.805 align:middle line:90%
and they're all doing this.

00:36:54.805 --> 00:36:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:10%
>> To be able to focus, to
be able to remember things,

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:10%
to link complex thought, to
track somebody's facial emotion

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:10%
as it has subtle shifts, all of
these things require incredibly

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:10%
high levels of subtle,
coordinated brain function.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
That general concept, to me,
is what links the various brain

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:84%
problems that people are facing,
ranging from Alzheimer's, where

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you can't remember, to attention
deficit, where you can't focus,

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
to behavioral
dysregulation, where

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.730 align:middle line:84%
little things send
you flying off

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:90%
in one direction or another.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all of
these at the chemical level,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:84%
you see varying
degrees of severity

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of depletion of protective
substances like glutathione

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.850 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:10%
And you see brainwave changes.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to that, there's
a few things with electronics

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.370 align:middle line:90%
that seem to impact sleep.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:90%
The first is the screen itself.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The light from the screen tends
to be a bluish or whitish tone,

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and that mimics
daylight, and the brain

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.160 align:middle line:90%
thinks it needs to be alert.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.410 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, melatonin,
which is the sleep signal,

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.430 align:middle line:84%
gets suppressed
for several hours.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So, even 10 minutes or so
screen time in an evening

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%
will suppress melatonin.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.060 align:middle line:84%
When melatonin's
suppressed, we don't

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:84%
get the benefit of it fighting
inflammation in the brain.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
kids with ADHD, they

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
have abnormally low
melatonin to begin with.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:10%
>> There has been a 53%
increase, in the past decade,

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.160 align:middle line:10%
in all 11% of kids who've been
diagnosed with the disorder

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:10%
and approximately two thirds are
being treated with medications

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.330 align:middle line:10%
like Ritalin and Adderall.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> On the surface, the
answer would appear simple--

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:84%
monitor your
child's screen time,

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and limit their exposure
to wireless technology.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that
taking away their devices

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:90%
may not be enough.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Smart meters are
the new, or newer,

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:10%
meters that are replacing the
analog meters on your home

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:10%
electric meters and gas meters.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:10%
It uses electromagnetic
frequency

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.939 align:middle line:10%
to send DTE information
about power use.

00:39:12.939 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:10%
This gets rid of the
need for meter readers

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:10%
and notifies the power
company about outages.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:20.700 align:middle line:10%
But some say such meters
are making them sick.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Many, many people
who are perfectly fine,

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.750 align:middle line:84%
prior to the installation
of the smart meter that goes

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
into their house, they can't
sleep, they have headaches,

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:90%
they have depression.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's coincident with the
going in of the smart meter.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>> This is similar to the
radiation debate over cell

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.470 align:middle line:10%
phones and cancer, right?

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:10%
This is very similar to
that debate, in that it's

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:10%
the same kind of radiation, and
the research into its safety

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:10%
is not conclusive.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:10%
But here's the big difference.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.300 align:middle line:10%
You can choose how often you
use your cell phone, right?

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.984 align:middle line:10%
But with smart meters
you don't have a choice.

00:39:56.984 --> 00:39:59.400 align:middle line:10%
The frequency with which you
are exposed to this radiation

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:10%
is determined by
the power company.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.970 align:middle line:10%
>> We're confident in the specs
of our meters and the safeness

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:10%
of the meters, at this point.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:10%
>> What Pepco says is happening
is that these smart meters send

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.920 align:middle line:10%
out communications every four
to six hours, on a daily basis.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:10%
But what we're seeing is
that these smart meters

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:10%
communicate about four to six
times a minute, if not more.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When we lived in
Lafayette, years ago,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the first areas of
deployment of the smart meters.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely
did not want one,

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that this
nonionizing radiation was not

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So I called to opt out,
and they said at the time

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:90%
there was no opt-out.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want this
thing off my house.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.904 align:middle line:90%
And they did do it.

00:40:41.904 --> 00:40:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem
fair to me that we

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:84%
have to opt out of
something we don't want,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.680 align:middle line:90%
but people can do that.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They can call, and they
can opt out of the meter.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The driving force of the
21st century will be powerful

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:84%
processing, centralized
in the cloud,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and wirelessly connected
to thin clients.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Autonomous vehicles will
be controlled in the cloud.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Smart city energy grids,
transportation networks,

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and water systems will be
controlled in the cloud.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Immersive education
and entertainment

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.260 align:middle line:90%
will come from the cloud.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But such futures
won't come to pass

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:84%
unless the pathway
to and from the cloud

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:84%
is low-latency,
ultra-fast, and secure.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>> 5G's been approved.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.980 align:middle line:10%
The FCC voted on it.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be rolled out.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.260 align:middle line:10%
It will be faster, and it'll
take up more of the spectrum.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> 5G has an enormous
amount of promise.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's expected to enable
all sorts of things

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
like virtual reality,
self-driving cars.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.150 align:middle line:84%
You could potentially download
a movie within a couple seconds.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.940 align:middle line:84%
- With 5G comes the
small cell equipment

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to be putting
on every pole in every city,

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:10.680 align:middle line:84%
right outside people's
windows, or on fake mailboxes.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has taken into account
the cumulative radiation

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that we are all getting,
especially children!

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:22.190 align:middle line:10%
And there were no premarket
safety testing on any of this!

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.910 align:middle line:10%
>> (CHANTING) Smart meters kill!

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So many people involved in
the science around this issue

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:10%
are out there, arguing for
massive change to everything,

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:10%
from tearing down the structure
that we have of regulation

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.330 align:middle line:10%
and public safety to
getting rid of technology,

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:10%
to do all kinds of
things that are extreme.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Fact is, none of those
things are going to happen.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It really has to be solved
more from a regulatory point

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:84%
of view, more from a
population-based point of view.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Good evening.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:10%
The World Health
Organization today

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.570 align:middle line:10%
says cell phones are
possibly carcinogenic.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.060 align:middle line:10%
>> People are hearing that the
World Health Organization --

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.976 align:middle line:10%
that's the medical arm
of the United Nations--

00:43:04.976 --> 00:43:07.110 align:middle line:10%
is sounding the alarm
about cell phones.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It puts it in the company of
several other kinds of things,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:84%
like lead is also a
possible carcinogen,

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.150 align:middle line:84%
according to the WHO, as well as
engine exhaust and chloroform.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> That classification
has been done in 2011.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:10%
Since that time, we have
at least two large studies

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.440 align:middle line:10%
suggest that it
should be reclassified

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:10%
as at least group 2A.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Or some people
believe that it should

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:37.530 align:middle line:10%
be reclassified as group 1--
so, it's 100% carcinogenic,

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.037 align:middle line:10%
in other words.

00:43:39.037 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The classification means
there cannot be an assurance

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.360 align:middle line:90%
of safety.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And it signals a need
for more research.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:10%
And then, for some, it
would signal the need

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.170 align:middle line:10%
for being
precautionary, in terms

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:54.210 align:middle line:10%
of handling this exposure.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> In view of our present
scientific knowledge,

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we hereby stress
international institutions,

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.770 align:middle line:84%
particularly the World
Health Organization,

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.560 align:middle line:90%
to recognize EHS and MCS.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Although our scientific
knowledge remains incomplete,

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.110 align:middle line:10%
we unanimously acknowledge
this serious hazard

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.690 align:middle line:10%
to public health,
urgently requiring

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.330 align:middle line:10%
the recognition of these
two pathological disorders

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:10%
at international level.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.470 align:middle line:10%
>> What is really needed,
and what this conference was

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:10%
intended to provide, is a strong
statement to the World Health

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.130 align:middle line:10%
Organization that there is
sufficient scientific evidence

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.290 align:middle line:10%
today to classify
electrosensitivity as a medical

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.130 align:middle line:10%
condition.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And what this will
do is go a long way

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:84%
toward letting
physicians know they've

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.800 align:middle line:84%
got to get educated and learn
to began to treat patients

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.880 align:middle line:90%
with this condition.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There are signs that the
message is beginning to sink

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:10%
Some countries are
adopting laws to reduce

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:59.340 align:middle line:10%
children's exposure in schools.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.190 align:middle line:10%
The European Parliament and
some European legal courts

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:10%
are starting to acknowledge
the correlation between EHS

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:10%
and radio-frequency exposure.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Today, Sweden recognizes EHS
as a functional impairment.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.680 align:middle line:10%
>> If the World Health
Organization recognized

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:10%
electrosensitivity
as a real thing,

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.915 align:middle line:10%
I think it would help
in a lot of ways.

00:45:20.915 --> 00:45:23.075 align:middle line:84%
You know, talking to the
teachers about it, they--

00:45:23.075 --> 00:45:24.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you
could show them,

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.074 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's not
just me, the parent,

00:45:26.074 --> 00:45:28.335 align:middle line:84%
it's the doctors,
the scientists.

00:45:28.335 --> 00:45:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> When this first came up, that
we realized we might have some

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.350 align:middle line:84%
sensitivity issues in our house,
the first thing we did was just

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
turned off the
wireless at night.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And that seemed like
the easiest first step.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.220 align:middle line:90%
We hard-lined completely.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And we have the plug-ins.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is what
helps us hard-line.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.185 align:middle line:90%
Plug it into here.

00:45:48.185 --> 00:45:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Signal's going
through the walls,

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to come out here.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.724 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.724 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to my office.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Plug it in here,
grab the signal,

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and send the signal through
this Thunderbolt, here.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.707 align:middle line:84%
- I can still use
the laptop computer

00:46:04.707 --> 00:46:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and take it anywhere
in the house I want to,

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
but I just plug it in to
whatever the nearest outlet is.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> These are all things
that immediately will reduce

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.050 align:middle line:90%
your exposure.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Use a wired earpiece.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.126 align:middle line:90%
Concentrate on speakerphone.

00:46:23.126 --> 00:46:25.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The worst time to put a phone
right next to the head is when

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:10%
you say "hello," because it's
programmed to go to max power.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.060 align:middle line:84%
100 times a minute, it
says, where are you,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.980 align:middle line:84%
here I am, where
are you, here I am.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.030 align:middle line:90%
We can change that.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.220 align:middle line:84%
You can program it to
do that less often.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You can have it go, as
the Android system does,

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.100 align:middle line:84%
into a deep sleep, so
that it doesn't always

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.480 align:middle line:90%
ping you back and forth.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Be aware of the number of
sources of wireless that sneak

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:90%
into everyday life.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.350 align:middle line:84%
As you layer up,
your dose actually

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:84%
is larger and larger as
we're, at the same time,

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:84%
deciding we have to have
lower and lower exposures

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:84%
to protect our
health, our sleep,

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and the next generations.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of my sensitivities
we wanted to address it

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.570 align:middle line:84%
at the boys' school, because
all the schools are wireless.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Every school is wireless.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So we asked them,
at least if they're

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:84%
going to be in there
all day, can we at least

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.250 align:middle line:84%
take out one of
the factors and not

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.710 align:middle line:90%
have their laptops be wireless?

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So, by doing that, we
were able to convince them

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.590 align:middle line:90%
to hard-line their computers.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Nowadays, because there's
so many kids that have food

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:26.830 align:middle line:84%
allergies that we've
explained it to the teachers

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and the other kids in the
class as kind of a similarity,

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.800 align:middle line:84%
just as you wouldn't make every
kid in the class eat peanut,

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:84%
because some kids have
a sensitivity to that,

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.195 align:middle line:84%
please don't make every kid
in the class use wireless.

00:47:37.195 --> 00:47:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Alan's situation now is
that he's been fortunate.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.090 align:middle line:84%
He's alive and doing fairly
well, eight years later.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:84%
He does have to go for MRIs
every four months, to see

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:90%
if there's any new growth.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully
there has not been.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.537 align:middle line:90%
>> I live six months at a time.

00:47:57.537 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:84%
You never know when
you're going to come out

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to be--

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're going
to say it's growing again.

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.170 align:middle line:84%
She sees what I'm going
through and what our family's

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:84%
going through and
doesn't want to see

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that happen to anybody else.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.056 align:middle line:84%
Just calling it Right to Know
says what it's all about.

00:48:15.056 --> 00:48:17.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm really proud of you!

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks.

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:22.665 align:middle line:10%
>> All this work is in
response to my illness.

00:48:22.665 --> 00:48:25.185 align:middle line:10%


00:48:25.185 --> 00:48:28.414 align:middle line:10%
And it means a lot to me!

00:48:28.414 --> 00:48:29.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:48:29.812 --> 00:48:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very tough fight.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a long time.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in this
for about eight years.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's times where
I feel like giving up,

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and then there's times
where I say no, we're

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.504 align:middle line:90%
going to make progress.

00:48:45.504 --> 00:48:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to stop.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually when I hear
from more and more people,

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.900 align:middle line:84%
every day, that are
sensitive to wireless,

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.510 align:middle line:84%
or I hear from people,
every week or two,

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that their spouse has
a brain tumor that they

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:84%
think is from their cell phone,
then I say, I'm not giving up.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:10%
I do have a certain
sense of optimism

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.060 align:middle line:10%
that eventually the
right thing will

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:10%
happen, like it
did with tobacco,

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:10%
like it did with asbestos.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Every day, new
technologies enrich our lives.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.160 align:middle line:84%
5G and all its wonders is
coming to a lamppost near you.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So take precautionary steps
to reduce your exposure.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.710 align:middle line:10%
Whenever possible,
favorite good,

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:55.030 align:middle line:10%
old-fashioned wired connections.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.430 align:middle line:10%
Use airplane mode
as much as you can.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And before you go
to sleep, remember

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to turn off your Wi-Fi routers
and all emitting devices.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.786 align:middle line:90%
Make a change, tonight.

00:50:04.786 --> 00:50:08.027 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) We can do this.

00:50:08.027 --> 00:50:10.420 align:middle line:90%
We can get it right.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.780 align:middle line:10%
We can do this.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.361 align:middle line:10%
Mute your screen tonight.

00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Turn it off, now.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.890 align:middle line:90%
You can dim the lights.

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Many choices.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.955 align:middle line:10%
Now here's our advice.

00:50:27.955 --> 00:50:39.835 align:middle line:90%


00:50:39.835 --> 00:50:48.580 align:middle line:10%
We get wise, get wired!

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.080 align:middle line:10%
Get off the grid,
get off the grid!

00:50:52.080 --> 00:51:00.580 align:middle line:10%
We get wise, get wired!

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Get off the grid,
get off the grid!

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.450 align:middle line:90%
We can do this.

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:16.550 align:middle line:90%
Make a change tonight.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.430 align:middle line:90%
We can do this.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Use less Wi-Fi.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.650 align:middle line:10%
Keep it wired.

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.626 align:middle line:90%
Keep it all in sight.

00:51:28.626 --> 00:51:31.106 align:middle line:90%
Getting smart now.

00:51:31.106 --> 00:51:33.586 align:middle line:10%
Turn off all the lights.

00:51:33.586 --> 00:51:43.010 align:middle line:90%


00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:49.100 align:middle line:90%
We get wise, get wired!

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.820 align:middle line:90%


00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Get off the grid,
get off the grid!

00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:03.200 align:middle line:90%
