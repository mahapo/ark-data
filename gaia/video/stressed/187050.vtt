It's a word we hear every day.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:90%
People are stressed out.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Work is stressful.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But what do we really
know about stress?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Before we can figure
that out, let's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
take a quick travel back in
time starting around 70,000 BC.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Hunter gatherers had
to be on high alert

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to survive from other
predators in their environment.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Even though this seems like
an extremely long time ago,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
we actually react to stress
in the environment just

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
like these early people.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's fast forward to
early in the 17th century

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to see French philosopher Rene
Descartes, who famously said,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:90%
I think therefore I am.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
He is also responsible
for the idea

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of mind-body dualism, which
some call the mind-body problem.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
He theorized that if
the mind was a thinking

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
thing and the body was
a non-thinking thing,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
that the mind could
exist without the body

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
but the body could not exist
without the mind, which

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
essentially declared
them as separate.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
This paved the way for
many schools of thought

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:90%
addressing this mind-body split.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Several decades later,
we hear the word stress

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
used by English natural
philosopher Robert

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Hooke in engineering terms.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
He was interested in
how man-made structures,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
such as bridges could
be made to withstand

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:90%
heavy loads without collapsing.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
He created what he called
the law of elasticity, which

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated how
something like a spring

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:84%
could withstand a
certain amount of stress

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
before it reached
a breaking point.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
This machine-like
analogy proved to be

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
fertile ground for future
explanations of how

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
humans experience stress.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
His rival at the time,
Sir Isaac Newton,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
would soon introduce
his three laws

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
of motion, which would
continue to point

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
toward a mechanistic
view of the body.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
He also held a grudge
against Robert Hooke

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and is responsible for why
you've probably never heard

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:90%
of him.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And now, to jump ahead
to the mid 1800s.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
French physician Claude
Bernard introduced the idea

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that the internal environment
of living organisms

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
must remain fairly
constant in response

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to changes in the
external environment.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Based on this work, in the early
1900s American physiologist

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
Walter Bradford
Cannon coined the term

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
homeostasis to describe this
neutral stable state that

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:84%
needed to exist for
the body to survive.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:84%
He also coined the
term fight or flight,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
but we'll get back
to that later.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to our current
understanding of stress,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
the man responsible is Hungarian
Canadian endocrinologist Hans

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Selye.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
He is known for his work
studying what he called

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:90%
general adaptation syndrome.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
He would later coined
the term stress,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:84%
which is still used to explain
aspects of the stress response.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
This response is directly
responsible for helping

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
the body to return
to homeostasis,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.152 align:middle line:90%
which brings us to today.

00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:90%

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people, when
they think of stress,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
they think it's like they're
stressed out in their mind,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
they're worrying about things,
they're obsessing about things.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
The response part of
the stress response

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
is your body's response
to that stress.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So most of us walking around, we
don't put two and two together.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.727 align:middle line:84%
>> When the lay person hears
something like stress response,

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
they know that stress is-- they
think that stress is the cause

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.193 align:middle line:90%
of their problem.

00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:84%
What we teach them
is stress is actually

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
an aggravating factor of
whatever existing weakness

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:90%
they have.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.198 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
stressed all the time.

00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we
want to take a look at

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is that people have physical
stress, biochemical nutritional

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.223 align:middle line:84%
stress, and mental
emotional stress.

00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
People think, when
they think of stress,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.307 align:middle line:84%
it's whatever
they're stressed out

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
about at their job or their
career or their family

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is going on
in their life personally.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But stress takes
many different forms.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.462 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is to
make sure that they

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
know is that all of these
things are equally important.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Your mind and your body
are the same thing.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not some New Age-y
kind of statement.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
If you alter your mind, it's
going to alter your body.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can address a
person's stress in their life,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that
should be number one.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.435 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
that mental stress

00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
will affect the body
in a physical way.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.528 align:middle line:84%
So so many Americans have
gastrointestinal issues.

00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:90%
They have stomach issues.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Their digestion's not great.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.673 align:middle line:90%
They bloat after they eat.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, there's a good portion
of that that's from food.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
so much of our stress

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
goes right to our
digestive tract.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I've found
with many patients,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
as I am addressing their food,
but more importantly, it's

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:84%
also looking at what else
is going on in their life.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
how when they're

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.602 align:middle line:84%
able to digest more of what's
going on in their life,

00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
they're able to digest
their food better,

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and everything else in the
whole system starts clearing up.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The person who has a
heart attack today,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:90%
were they healthy yesterday?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Were they healthy last
week or last month?

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.177 align:middle line:90%
Most likely not.

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
that was going

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
on that led to that
crisis, that heart attack.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:90%
The emotions work the same way.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
They accumulate,
they accumulate,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and then something goes wrong.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> When somebody is
under a lot of stress,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
at least emotional stress, a
whole cascade of things can be

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
going on, from neck problems
to low back problems to stomach

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:90%
problems to anxiety to--

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people go
through cyclical infections

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:90%
to you name it.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:28.228 align:middle line:84%
Stress causes almost
every condition out there.

00:07:28.228 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just take some
of that emotional pressure

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:84%
off their system, at least
the chemistry of that emotion,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.194 align:middle line:84%
their body has a
better chance to heal.

>> When we're struck by
a stressor on a day that

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
our system is already somewhat
compromised, it's just like--

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
it's really like
adding, you know,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
one more little teeny
tiny hair to the pile.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And it just, everything just
crumbles in that moment.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're very adaptable
and we're very--

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, our nervous
systems are very intelligent,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and it figures out a way to
kind of cope and get through.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%

end up doing is

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
sabotaging myself, I don't know
why I'm doing this to myself.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And they are beating
themselves up

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
because these patterns
are coming into play.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't realize is
that these patterns saved them

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:90%
as children.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
These patterns are
survival skills that

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:90%
have just gone a little wonky.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Where I find stress is
a really big deal for a lot

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
people are their own
internal thoughts.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:90%
They beat themselves up.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
they're good enough.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they
have to be perfect.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
fail at something,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:90%
they stress themselves out.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And those are the stressors
which oftentimes people don't

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%
think they're stressed about.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So ask yourself this, if every
time you do something wrong

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:90%
do you beat yourself up?

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you're
stressing yourself out.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we try and do is we help
people recognize those things

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
so that they can deal with them
a little bit more effectively

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't actually
stress themselves out

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:90%
internally.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people understand
that there's something called

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:90%
the fight or flight syndrome.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the fight
or flight syndrome,

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
that's looking at a part of
the nervous system called

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
the autonomic nervous system.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The autonomic nervous system
is a science-y way of talking

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
about the part of the nervous
system that isn't the central

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:90%
nervous system.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.785 align:middle line:84%
So the central nervous system
is the brain and the nerves

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:90%
that connect down.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
The autonomic nervous system
has two major branches,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, sympathetic,
which we call fight or flight,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and the parasympathetic,
which we could call

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:90%
relaxation and restoration.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
When we're in that latter mode,
the relaxation restoration

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
mode of our nervous system,
that's when healing occurs.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
That's when the body
rejuvenates itself.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the
fight or flight mode,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
we're actually getting ready to
ward off something threatening.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:90%
So we need that.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But we can't be
in it all the time

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
or it has negative
health effects.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> You might be driving in
traffic and someone cuts

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
in front of you, your
life's not in danger,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
but your body gives
the same response.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And that ties back into
the stress response.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go into that
fight or flight state of being,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
your parasympathetic calming
nervous system is turned off.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:84%
That also turns of
all your healing

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and resting and digesting
portion of your body.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we don't find ways of
breaking that fight or flight

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
response, then the symptoms
you see of too much stress,

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
poor digestion, can't
sleep at night, make sense.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you have this activated
sympathetic nervous system

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.623 align:middle line:90%
that that's what it's all about.

00:11:10.623 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's kind
of like, you know,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
if you have a Ferrari and
you're going 140 miles per hour,

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's what it's built
for, but if it goes 140 miles

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:84%
per hours all day long, 24/7,
and you never stop and you

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.745 align:middle line:84%
never get a chance for it to
be garaged and parked for it

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to rest, that can be
damaging to the car.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's much like our bodies.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it's constantly
in fight or flight

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and in stress mode
all the time, then it

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:90%
can lead to early breakdown.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to remember
that stress is not up here.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It's whole body.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And that stress is a
physiological phenomenon,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And I often will
use with patients

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
the example of, OK,
you know, stress

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
is a physiological phenomenon
that is not necessarily

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
in your control.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
rational response.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.938 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like when
you're driving down the road,

00:12:01.938 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going, OK, I
look at my speedometer,

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.188 align:middle line:84%
my rational brain
is in front of me

00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:07.150 align:middle line:90%
and it says, OK, I'm going 55.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden you
see sirens in your rear view

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
mirror.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The patients always
know, they say,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, yeah, I grip
the steering wheel,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
my heart starts to
pound, sometimes I sweat,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
my tummy gets butterflies.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And with that,
it's like, exactly,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that is the
physiology of stress.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Because your rational brain
looks at your speedometer

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:90%
and says, oh, I'm going 55.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But you still see those sirens
and think, uh, I'm in trouble.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a threat.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's a perceived threat.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily real.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the emotional reality.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the police
car goes right by you.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%
You go, OK, phew.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But you still feel the
physiological effects

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:90%
of stress.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
The other part of that is that
people are so used to that

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.425 align:middle line:90%
nowadays that it's normal.

00:12:51.425 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:90%

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Neuroscientist and
pharmacologist Dr.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Candace Pert made a breakthrough
discovery in 1972 when she

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:90%
discovered the opiate receptor.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
It was thought for any drug
to work in your system,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
it had to first bind to
receptors in your cells.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But what made this
discovery so exciting

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:84%
was that it meant
that the receptor must

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
be used for something
created by the body,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
not just for external
things like drugs.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This led to the
discovery of endorphins,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:90%
our body's very own morphine.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
These discoveries
led to what she

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
called the molecules of emotion,
that when you have an emotion

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
it is the result of
physical molecules,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:84%
known as neuropeptides,
being released into your body

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and attaching
themselves to receptors

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in every cell of your body,
which means that emotions are

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
actually a physiological
phenomenon, not

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:84%
a mental construct,
as we had thought.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Candace Pert, the
famous researcher,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
actually found that there were
neurotransmitter receptors

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in our gut.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's more
neurotransmitter receptors

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
in our gut than there
are in our brain.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> She taught us that the mind
is not just above the neck,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:90%
it's throughout the whole body.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.238 align:middle line:84%
There's intelligence in
every cell of the body.

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Emotions, really,
as it turns out,

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
are physiological phenomenon,
not necessarily psychological

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So kind of how we
say it is that we

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
use these words to explain how
we feel, that we're stressed,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that this is going
on in my life,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.040 align:middle line:84%
to try and communicate
to our conscious mind

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:90%
what we're experiencing.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The reality is is
that we all have

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
these what we would call
conditioned responses.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The concept of conditioning
came from the observations

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:90%
of Ivan Pavlov.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
He was a Russian physiologist
who conducted the famous dog

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:90%
studies in the late 1800s.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
While they weren't the most
ethical of experiments,

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
at least we were able
to learn from them.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Every time he would feed the
dog, he would ring a bell.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
After doing this several
times, he simply rang the bell

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:90%
without feeding the dog.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Even though there
wasn't any food,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
the dog still salivated
as if food was coming.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
This unconscious
physiological response

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:90%
is the result of conditioning.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans, we drool our
whole life away, right?

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We have these different
metaphors that people use,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
like he really
pushed my buttons,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
she really knows how
to pull my strings,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
they did it to me,
all this kind of stuff

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to really explain our
experience of what's going on.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just a
conditioned response.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And what we like
to leave everybody

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
with knowing is
that how it works

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is what you don't
express in life,

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.518 align:middle line:84%
you'll repress till it expresses
as disease or dysfunction.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like Woody Allen
used to say, I never get angry,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I just grow a tumor.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Meaning if I don't
get my stuff out,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
it stays in until it comes
out of something ugly,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
either a behavior or
a health condition.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Symptoms can show up in
the form of like anxiety

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:90%
or depression.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And in modern days,
I think people are

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:90%
quick to try to take a pill.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And maybe the drug helps.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say that medication
isn't good once in a while.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But often, it's just masking
or covering up a symptom.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it helps a
person through a crisis,

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:90%
so it can be good.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But if we can get to
what is the underlying

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:84%
cause that keeps getting
re-triggered, lives can change.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.842 align:middle line:90%

00:16:21.842 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In Philadelphia, exciting
new research is being done

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
at the Marcus Institute of
Integrative Health at Jefferson

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.557 align:middle line:84%
University, one of the
leaders in this field.

00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the critical pieces
of what we were doing with

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
our initial imaging study is
to expose people to the various

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:84%
traumas and stressors that
have really created a problem

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:90%
for the person.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
listen to an audio file

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.543 align:middle line:84%
of these very traumatic
moments in their life.

00:16:58.543 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
we were looking

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
at cancer patients who
have struggled with cancer

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and usually have a
very traumatic part

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of either the diagnosis
or the treatment

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:90%
that they just can't get rid of.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these people
physiologically reacted

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to thinking about
that stressful event.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Heart rate went up or galvanic
skin response changed.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what we had
were people who

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:27.829 align:middle line:84%
were physiologically reactive
and subjectively distressed

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
by this event, and it's been
going on for a long time.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly
was this study?

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Monti and his
team created it

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
as a randomized
controlled trial.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
All of the participants had
a distressing cancer-related

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
memory that was associated with
symptoms of traumatic stress.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
These symptoms have been
intruding in their lives

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:90%
for at least six months.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And for many of
the participants,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
it had been years.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them made a script
explaining the traumatic events

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:90%
in their own words.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.123 align:middle line:84%
That script was then
read back to them

00:17:58.123 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
while they were
given a functional

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
MRI to measure the
levels of distress

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
they were experiencing.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Since this was a randomized
controlled trial,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
the participants had been
split up into two groups.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
One group received neuro
emotional technique, or NET,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and the others were assigned to
the waitlist control condition.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
The results of those
who received NET

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:90%
were dramatic, to say the least.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But before we can
go any further,

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
we have to head over to
Encinitas, California

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.528 align:middle line:90%
to meet Dr. Scott Walker.

00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:29.516 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:29.516 --> 00:18:48.167 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of my patients
weren't getting well.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.758 align:middle line:84%
Some of them would
get well over time.

00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Some of them wouldn't get well.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
The people that didn't get
results had a look of tension

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
in their eyes.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:90%
This is just something--

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I came from a town
of 500 people.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy I
came from a small town,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because I could see
people in different ways.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And the people that seemed
to be burdened, I think,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:90%
were emotionally burdened.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones
that had less results.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I made up in my
mind that maybe they

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:90%
were having emotional trouble.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.632 align:middle line:90%
That's not a new thought.

00:19:21.632 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
People have been
thinking that people--

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
emotional stress has affected
the body for some time.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
how to solve it.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> But as it turned out, Dr.
Walker went to a seminar where

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
he met a chiropractor by the
name of Dr. Jennifer Lamonica.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
He learned that she would give
certain people an adjustment,

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and soon after, when they
would think about work,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.263 align:middle line:84%
that their spine
would be out of place

00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
before they even
left the office.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Hearing this reaffirmed
his suspicion

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
that there had to be
something else going on.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The first patient, on the
next day that I was home,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
she had gone to work and gotten
in an automobile accident.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm still-- my mind is
not in my compassionate heart.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:90%
My mind is in my mind.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, maybe she
had fear in this accident.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
This is a chance I can
work this hypothesis.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, you
were in an accident.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you fear when
you were in the accident.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.927 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh.

00:20:15.927 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I didn't do that.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's the way I was thinking.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> One of Dr. Scott's
mentors, Dr. George Goodheart,

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
correlated the primary muscles
of the body with the major

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
meridians used in
traditional Chinese medicine.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have these medians,
they're kind of like channels,

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:90%
or like we call it, free--

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I like to describe them
as like freeway systems.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So they run from different areas
of the body, from your head

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to your toe, to your
toes back to your trunk,

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:90%
to your trunk to the face.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So they all travel
across the body,

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.622 align:middle line:84%
and they go even through the
deeper layers of the organs.

00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, the philosophy
is that if there

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is a traffic jam or a blockage
in any of those meridians,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
there's a disruption of the
vital force of the body, which

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.753 align:middle line:90%
is the qi, or the blood.

00:20:55.753 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though traditional
Chinese medicine has been using

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
meridians for
thousands of years,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
a recent discovery by Auburn
University professor Vitaly

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Vodyanoy is bringing more
scientific attention to this

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.533 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know all the
meridians and all the emotions,

00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:11.035 align:middle line:84%
but I knew fear
and I knew kidneys.

00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, what I want
you to do is I want

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.178 align:middle line:84%
you to think about
the fear that you had

00:21:15.178 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:90%
when you were in that accident.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, OK.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And so she did.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I adjusted the
sequences for the kidney,

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:90%
which is T1, T5, and T8.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to her, I
said, how does that feel?

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.142 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see if I
could get rid of fear.

00:21:30.142 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And she thought I meant
how does her neck feel.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you know.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And she says, oh, how do I feel?

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.532 align:middle line:84%
She goes, yeah,
that feels better.

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And then I was ashamed.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't thinking
about her poor neck.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about this
idea that I had of maybe

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I could get rid of the fear.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, oh, oh, OK,
and [CLEARS THROAT] how does

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.400 align:middle line:90%
the fear feel now?

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
She says, yeah, I don't feel
any fear about it at all now.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, yes.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Any symptom that we have
really could have a stress

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:90%
component.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how
we came to develop NET.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Scott figured out
that as a chiropractor,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:84%
he would help certain problems
and help spinal conditions

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:90%
or painful situations.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But there were those
certain cases that

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
didn't resolve all the way.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So it could be a knee or a
shoulder or a TMJ or a backache

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:90%
or a stomach ache or anything.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And what, 80% would get fixed.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But what about those
20 that didn't?

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really a
brilliant intervention.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how Dr.
Walker put it together,

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
given that there was
nothing like it at the time.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And he just somehow put together
these different concepts.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense, in hindsight,
how he put them together.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.898 align:middle line:84%
But it really required a
special brain to do that.

00:22:56.898 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I knew I was onto something.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:59.650 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, there
is the placebo effect.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.602 align:middle line:90%
You've got to watch that.

00:23:02.602 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to encourage
the placebo effect.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to discourage
the placebo effect.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:90%
So I made a pact with myself.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.902 align:middle line:90%
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

00:23:12.902 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had this patient come
in one day, and she said,

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
you did that emotional thing
about this miscarriage baby

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:90%
I feel so relieved.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It was such a
cloud over my head.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I'd lost this baby.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well--

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.835 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to write my
notes, and she reached over,

00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
kind of shirt I had on,

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:84%
but she grabbed me and
she put her face in mine.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:90%
I said you helped me!

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:90%
And there I was.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't write.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.457 align:middle line:90%
I was nose-to-nose with her.

00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
And she said it very forcefully.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:90%
She said, I said you helped me.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my god,
what have I become,

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that I can't celebrate my
patient's win, that I can't

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:90%
celebrate her joy with her.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:90%
What's happened to me?

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going to leave the
research for the researchers.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.538 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:04.538 --> 00:24:07.018 align:middle line:90%

00:24:07.018 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Later, with the help of
fellow practitioners, Dr.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Scott created the ONE
Research Foundation.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
They have privately funded
over 30 research studies

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to date, which brings
us back to the present.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Meet one of the participants
in this study, Dr. Jim Buckley.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And in 2014, I got a
diagnosis of non Hodgkin's B

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:90%
cell lymphoma.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And it really took
me by surprise.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked that I had come
down with something like this.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a health
care practitioner.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not supposed to get sick.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
spending so much time

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
taking care of everybody else
that I kind of let myself fall

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:90%
by the wayside.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Conventional cancer
therapy was not anything

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:84%
that I ever thought
I would use, just

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
because I had strong
feelings that that was not

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the way to go in terms
of getting healthy again.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But as it turned out, the
tumor that I had in my abdomen

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:90%
was about as big as a football.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was pushing on my
kidney and my intestines

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and it was really
starting to cause

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:90%
me an awful lot of trouble.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up doing what
I said I would never

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:90%
do in getting chemotherapy.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And during the
process of that, I

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:84%
found out that the ONE
Foundation was doing a research

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
project on the emotional
effect of hearing

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:90%
that you have cancer.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was in that boat now.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
First, they kind
of questioned me

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
about what was
the biggest impact

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.667 align:middle line:90%
of hearing that you had cancer.

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
How did that impact
your life and what

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:90%
was the hardest thing about it?

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go down and list
what was the most difficult

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:84%
What came up was hardest to
leave my wife and daughters,

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:84%
feeling like I hadn't finished
the work that I was here to do

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and felt as though I was
leaving them in the lurch

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and felt a lot of responsibility
in terms of how I kind of had

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
fallen down on my self
care and was, as a result,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.657 align:middle line:84%
potentially could lose my
life and closeness with them.

00:26:30.657 --> 00:26:34.633 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:34.633 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I
heard over and over again from

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
participants in the study was
that these distressing memories

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and experiences would intrude or
impact on positive experiences

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
in the present day when
they least expected it.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So they might be chopping
lettuce in their kitchen

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and be suddenly
reminded or flooded

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
with feelings of how
stressful it was to be sick

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
or what it was like to be
retching over the garbage can

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
in their kitchen
all those years ago.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So just being in
the kitchen again

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
reminded them of
that earlier stress.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The passage of time
wasn't making it go away.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that's kind
of an old conception

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:90%
that we found is incorrect.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, time really
doesn't heal all wounds.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Because emotional wounds
are in the part of the brain

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:90%
where there is no sense of time.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes things happen
early in life where we are

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:84%
in a dangerous situation or
something is perceived to be

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:90%
awful happening.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And the body is unable to
extinguish that response

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:90%
on an unconscious level.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Years later, we
find out that that

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:84%
buried stress, those buried
feelings that have never

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
gone away, are still being
triggered in any situation that

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
looks the same, sounds
the same, smells the same,

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:84%
feels the same can trigger
that on an unconscious level

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and bring the feelings
back, even though it's

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:90%
a different situation.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So whatever
happened to you at 7,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious still thinks
it's happening right now.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And even as a practitioner,
once I learned that,

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:84%
it took me a long time to
wrap my mind around that.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's the truth.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not gee, now it
feels like I was then.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It is then.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.430 align:middle line:84%
There is no linear
time in that place.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So it is exactly that
moment that they're feeling.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's replicated just as
if it's happening right now.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What we were able to
observe in the brain is where

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
the distress was being
registered in the brain when

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
they listened to a script
of the traumatic event.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And that script has been
going on for a long time.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, I emphasize
that because it

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
isn't a matter of time
healing this particular wound.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:84%
The time has been going by
and going by and going by.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And the period of time of
the study was quite short.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the participants in
the study who received NET were

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:84%
given treatment
over several weeks,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and some of them had their
sessions all in one day.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
The findings were then
published in the Journal

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:90%
of Cancer Survivorship.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The main finding that we
really had was that these areas

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of the limbic system,
particularly the, what's called

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the para hippocampus, which
is very involved in our sort

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
of traumatic memories
and emotional,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:84%
our negative
emotional responses.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.720 align:middle line:84%
This was an area that was
far more active initially,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and then after undergoing
the NET program suddenly

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:90%
didn't really react very much.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It just wasn't there anymore
for most of those patients.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, everybody
had some response

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.480 align:middle line:84%
where there was far less to
no activation of those areas

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:84%
in the limbic
brain, particularly

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
the hippocampal area, which is
where distressing memories sit.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.250 align:middle line:84%
The activation was
virtually gone.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was a 50% increase
in the neuron density between

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the amygdala and
the frontal lobe.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Now the frontal lobe is the
front part of the brain.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's responsible for
long-term planning, thinking,

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:90%
complex reasoning.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of
the brain that says,

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:84%
everything's going
to be OK, I shouldn't

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.820 align:middle line:84%
be stressed about this, this
is nothing to worry about.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And my clients and the
participants in the study

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
will say all the time, I say
all the right things to myself,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:90%
but it just doesn't matter.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly true.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the message
isn't getting

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:90%
through to the emotional brain.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And we also know from this
study that every time a really

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
distressing event
gets reactivated

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
or there's a reminder of
it, that your nervous system

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:90%
reacts.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we looked
at the biofeedback,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
we know that the autonomic
nervous system gets involved.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And when the autonomic
nervous system

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
gets hyperactivated, that has
a negative effect on health

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.560 align:middle line:84%
outcomes, quality of
life across the board,

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
creates too much inflammation
in the system, and so on.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We talk about sort of the
brain normalizing itself.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
that is reflected

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in what these scans looked
at, that instead of having

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.450 align:middle line:84%
this overreaction in these
limbic areas of the brain,

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
the brain basically
said, OK, you know,

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
it's just one of my
memories now and it's not

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:90%
a traumatic memory.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't have these horrible
feelings that come up.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's reflected in what
the brain looked like.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I was even surprised
that baseline mood,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:84%
baseline anxiety, all
of those things changed.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Like when you think about it,
the person's overall quality

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
of life was changed from
three to five sessions

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:90%
of an intervention.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty dramatic.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I can tell you that I felt
physically different after

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:90%
receiving the treatment.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I had had a bunch of different
treatments during my attempts

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:90%
to treat the disease.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But I really felt as though
after that treatment,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I really took a turn
towards healing,

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:90%
and it was physically evident.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just an example of
how all the work that I'd

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
been doing for all those
years to help other people

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:90%
could actually help me, too.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It just, it reached
me in another way

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that it had never reached me
before, like how impactful

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and how important this work is.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
I know in my heart that
this treatment really

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
helped to shift how I healed.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like, I can
heal this now, where before,

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't--

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I may have thought that but I
didn't feel that in my body.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
You can have all the
positive affirmations

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:84%
you want and intend for
different things to happen.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's all cognitive.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:90%
That's all your brain talking.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But this was distinctly
different in that it

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.940 align:middle line:84%
was in my gut that
I felt different.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just a thought.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.321 align:middle line:84%
It was, I feel like
I can heal this.

00:33:29.321 --> 00:33:32.267 align:middle line:90%

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an emotional
component that happens from

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
being sick for long periods
of time or struggling with

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:84%
physical illness or watching
someone you love face

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:90%
a physical illness.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:90%
We're not floating heads.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
There is a combination
that happens

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.370 align:middle line:84%
where the mind and the
body work together.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
a physical illness,

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:90%
there is emotional component.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:84%
And when you're facing
emotional stress,

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:84%
like depression or
anxiety, there's

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.550 align:middle line:90%
a physical component to it.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And that both of those
need to be treated.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes people don't know
and they need that tool of NET

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that utilizes not just what's
in the conscious brain,

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
but what physiology is doing
that actually helps us to get

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.679 align:middle line:84%
at what's a little bit
less than conscious.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> But because NET uses
several unique components,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.570 align:middle line:84%
first being the muscle testing,
which allows the body to become

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.060 align:middle line:90%
its own biofeedback instrument.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:84%
The body then guides
the treatment.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:84%
By using the muscle testing,
it precisely and correctly

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.389 align:middle line:84%
identifies what these
periods of distress are.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we're really
doing with the muscle test is

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:84%
we're posing a concept and
then seeing if their body,

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the patient's body, has
a physiological response.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We're not measuring
true and false.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We're only measuring the
person's personal reaction

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like,
I oversimplified

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:84%
would be the amoeba moving
toward a bit of food

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:84%
or away from a bit of poison
that's in the Petri dish.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
measuring with the muscle test.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience of NET is far
different than what somebody

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.743 align:middle line:90%
observing it can know.

00:35:34.743 --> 00:35:38.194 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We're run so much by our
subconscious, at least 80%,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.890 align:middle line:84%
probably 99.9%, we're run
by our subconscious minds.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we're
kind of victim

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:90%
to those subconscious minds.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Because our subconscious mind
is running so much of the show,

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:84%
it can be difficult to break
out of our conditioning.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Scott explains that a neuro
emotional complex, or NEC,

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:84%
is when an emotion
gets stuck in the body.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In the NEC, we're
shedding the old perceptions,

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.822 align:middle line:84%
we're shedding the feelings
that went with them.

00:36:25.822 --> 00:36:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Usually the NEC, of
course, has something

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that is perceived by us to
be non-survival oriented.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It's counter survival.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we perceive it.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:90%
And so we're shedding that.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So most of the time what
happens is when people come

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
into my office, they've had
this issue for so long that they

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:50.390 align:middle line:84%
start to mistake the problem
that they're having as it

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:90%
actually being them.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So instead of them having
anxiety, they feel anxious

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and then they start to
attribute that to them just

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.820 align:middle line:90%
being an anxious person.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:84%
It becomes part
of their identity.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It's that feeling
of hopelessness

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:90%
that's so corrosive, I think.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And the idea for people,
the idea that there's

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:84%
some hope out there
that they could actually

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
get to the heart of why this
is actually happening over

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and over again in
their life and even

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:84%
return to the place where
it becomes something,

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.270 align:middle line:84%
a condition that they have
rather than who they are.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.270 align:middle line:90%
That's a great start, OK?

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And then move on from there.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> People often ask me, well,
that event doesn't seem like it

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.500 align:middle line:84%
was so traumatic or
anything like that.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.460 align:middle line:90%
So why did that come up?

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we
are just so bombarded

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:84%
with processed foods and sugar
and lack of sleep and the news

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and everything that we're
exposed to that our brain gets

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.520 align:middle line:90%
overloaded.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous system gets
overloaded with the emotions

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
it's trying to process.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So something that seems
somewhat insignificant

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.770 align:middle line:84%
may have hit us on a day
that our system was weak

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and it just didn't know
what to do with it.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> When one person years and
years later is still suffering

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:84%
from the death of a parent
and then another person years

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and years later is suffering
because they didn't get ice

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
cream at a birthday
party, it doesn't matter.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The person who lost a
parent might have actually

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.950 align:middle line:84%
adapted better than
the kid who didn't get

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:90%
ice cream at a birthday party.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Emotions have no logic.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:90%
They're just the emotions.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:84%
If they were logical, we'd
all figure our stuff out

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and no one would ever
have a health issue

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
or need to see a doctor or
a therapist for any reason

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:84%
because we would just
think about it, go, huh,

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.040 align:middle line:90%
and then we'd be fine.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't really work like that.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The memory stores
things, often inaccurately,

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:90%
as to what really happened.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not about that.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And what it can do is it can put
associated memories together,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.280 align:middle line:84%
so that when you recount
something or retell

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:84%
a story you add pieces that
really didn't even happen just

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.260 align:middle line:84%
by the way our
memories store stuff.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter that
it's logically correct

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.540 align:middle line:84%
or that they're overly
emotional or underly emotional.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:18.140 align:middle line:84%
If the body's having a
physiological reaction,

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
we can help connect the
different piece parts

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and let the body come to
closure with that thing.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> When we do muscle testing, we
get the body's feedback and we

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:90%
use that to help the body heal.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So logic and reason
oftentimes are not

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:90%
involved when we're doing NET.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.810 align:middle line:84%
We're just finding out
where the body is stuck.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there's
no way that we

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
would logically
ever figure it out

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.661 align:middle line:90%
unless we use muscle testing.

>> Upon further
analysis of the data,

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:84%
the team at Jefferson noticed
some very interesting changes

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:90%
regarding the cerebellum.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.408 align:middle line:84%
This led to the publishing of
their second paper in 2017.

00:40:00.408 --> 00:40:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of traditionally
been taught that the cerebellum

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
is primarily involved in the
coordination of our motor

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to emotions,
it's not that relevant.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not really helping
us with anything.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It's really just helping
us to move our hands

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and to move our legs and to do
that in a coordinated fashion.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But a growing number of research
studies, as we came to find

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.998 align:middle line:84%
and as we started to look
at it, we started to see,

00:40:22.998 --> 00:40:24.790 align:middle line:84%
well, gee, there's some
interesting studies

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:84%
that show that when the
cerebellum is activated,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that has something
to do with the laying

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.840 align:middle line:90%
down of traumatic memories.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> According to a scientific
paper published in 2015,

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
titled "The Emotional
Cerebellum,"

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:84%
imaging experts revealed the
cerebellum is activated during

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:84%
mental recall of emotional
personal episodes and during

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the learning of a conditioned
or unconditioned association

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.585 align:middle line:90%
involving emotions.

>> Even though the cerebellum
is relatively small--

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.418 align:middle line:84%
it's just kind of
these little, you know,

00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:84%
kind of balls in the
back of the brain--

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:84%
it has five times the number
of neurons as the rest

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.082 align:middle line:90%
of the brain combined.

00:40:58.082 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we started to
realize, well, you know,

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:84%
this is all starting
to make some sense.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
If this part of
the brain normally

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:84%
is involved in the coordination
of motor function maybe

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:84%
it's also involved
in the coordination

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:90%
of emotional function.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, then
perhaps what we're seeing

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:84%
is that as a result of going
through the neuro emotional

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:84%
technique and the various
elements that are involved

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in it that we are having
a direct impact on how

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.673 align:middle line:84%
that cerebellum is able
to regulate the emotional,

00:41:26.673 --> 00:41:28.840 align:middle line:84%
or help in the regulation
of these emotional centers

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one of the reasons
to get up and go to work

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:90%
as a medical researcher.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't get
to see these kinds

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.800 align:middle line:90%
of results every day.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But it also opens up the door
even more in terms of the field

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of cognitive neuroscience
and emotions and psychiatry

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and psychology, because it
helps us to understand that

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:55.030 align:middle line:84%
the cerebellum may be a very
critical area of our brain that

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:84%
is very much related to our
emotional selves and not just

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:03.970 align:middle line:84%
how our body moves, but how
our body is moved emotionally.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the people on my team
who knew nothing about NET,

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:84%
they're just analyzing, doing
the quantitative analysis

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of the MRIs pre and post,
they're like, what is this?

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:90%
What was this intervention?

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.080 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was just
really thrilled

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and so happy for the patients.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.863 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
what it's really about.

00:42:25.863 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though this study
was focused on people with

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:84%
traumatic stress from cancer,
the traumatic stress of going

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:84%
to war is an equally
important issue.

United States Marine
Corps corporal Rory Hamill

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:90%
sustained serious injuries.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It was February 13, 2011.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.210 align:middle line:90%
It's almost seven years now.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Took the minesweeper
off my point man's

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:51.110 align:middle line:84%
back after we received
some information

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that there was an improvised
explosive device in a compound

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.450 align:middle line:90%
by our location.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And I got about 3/4
of the compound swept.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And as I was nearing
the end of my search,

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I stepped on a little
metallic pressure

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:84%
plate which detonated homemade
explosives five feet behind me

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:90%
to the right.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And the explosion
and the blast force

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:84%
came from my right side, sheared
my right leg off instantly,

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.880 align:middle line:90%
clipped the back of my left leg.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I flew 10 feet in the
air, hit the ground

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:90%
on the back of my head.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:90%
My Marines saved my life.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:90%
They instantly rushed right in.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there could've been
a secondary IED in there,

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.050 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't care.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:35.190 align:middle line:84%
They dragged me out of the
blast zone, worked on me,

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.980 align:middle line:84%
stopped the bleeding,
stabilized me.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, on the helicopter
to the shock trauma unit

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I flatlined for
two minutes, and I

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:49.290 align:middle line:84%
was resuscitated and worked
on and began the long journey

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.090 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It took about a week
for me to get home,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because they need
to keep you stable

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:84%
when they put you
on the plane, and I

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:90%
wasn't quite stable enough.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But eventually I made it
back to Washington, DC,

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.518 align:middle line:90%
where I began my rehab.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:84%
It's very common with amputees,
we get phantom limb pain.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
That's where your
body is, I guess,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
firing off synapses and trying
to remap where the nerves are.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And it realized that there was
a huge chunk of nerves missing.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But that can translate
into phantom pain,

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:90%
phantom sensation.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we worked on at the office

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.190 align:middle line:90%
was we tried using a mirror.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:90%
It helped out a lot.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it kind
of tricked my brain--

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:49.195 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this, I have my
left leg and I'm looking at it,

00:44:49.195 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and to my brain, it made sense.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And it helped,
with a combination

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.150 align:middle line:84%
of the actual treatment, it
helped get a lot of that stress

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:59.560 align:middle line:90%
away from my body.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And the phantom
pains and sensations

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:90%
became very, very less frequent.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I still have
challenges every single day.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very hard.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And over the past
almost seven years,

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten a lot mentally
and physically stronger.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But NET has been an
integral part of that.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:84%
What I feel, what
I've seen with NET is

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:84%
it really is a mind-body
type of therapy.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can personally attest
to, normally, you know,

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:84%
if you have a physical thing,
you go to a physical doctor.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You have a mental thing,
you go to a mental doctor.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:84%
With NET, it hits both of
those at the same time.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I really, really
feel that's why

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:84%
there was such a
huge wave of emotion

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.060 align:middle line:84%
released initially and all
the subsequent appointments

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.120 align:middle line:84%
The doctor didn't
tell me that I was

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be cured of my
ailments or anything like that.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- but he did tell me
that it would help stabilize

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:03.490 align:middle line:84%
my body and help me get
back to a sense of normalcy

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:08.290 align:middle line:84%
in my everyday life, which it
did, hands down, immediately.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And it only got better
with the next few sessions

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:90%
and subsequently after.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It helped me a lot.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It helped me out
of a dark place,

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, that, with the help
of family and friends as well.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:29.165 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it was an amazing
supplement to my regimen,

00:46:29.165 --> 00:46:31.668 align:middle line:90%
to everything that I needed.

ego is there,

it reduces the capacity

Too often we get an idea, a
preconceived idea about what's

going on with the patient.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And how could we
possibly do that?

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we've only
lived our own life.

seminars that they're

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.810 align:middle line:84%
designed to address the
practitioners' needs,

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.060 align:middle line:84%

distressing events that just

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.270 align:middle line:84%
aren't resolving themselves
well or the big, big ones,

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:12.680 align:middle line:90%
they all affect us.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And they affect our
quality of life.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.243 align:middle line:84%
They affect how we're
functioning, how we're feeling,

00:48:17.243 --> 00:48:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not we're
thriving in the world

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.300 align:middle line:90%
the way we want to be.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And where 30 years ago
it was different thinking,

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole face of health
care is changing and people are

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:84%
more open now that what you
think could affect how you

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:39.230 align:middle line:84%
heal, what you eat, how you
exercise, meditation, yoga,

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:40.550 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And NET is just a tool.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
perfect time for it

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.510 align:middle line:84%
because I think the
consciousness of people

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:51.110 align:middle line:84%
in general is real open
that maybe I have something

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to do with my health condition.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we can help unlock
what was stuck in there,

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.920 align:middle line:84%
then all those other things
they're doing as well

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:90%
work better too.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It pays it forward in
so many different ways.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if one
person can be less

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:84%
stressed when they go home
to their family, when they

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
go into work, when they are on
the phone as a customer service

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.900 align:middle line:84%
representative,
then all of a sudden

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.180 align:middle line:84%
we have a better world,
cascading, cascading,

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:90%
cascading.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a really good
time in history to be there.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so wonderful
in the very beginning,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.650 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't know
where we were going

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:28.930 align:middle line:84%
or what we were doing or
if it was going to work

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.180 align:middle line:90%
or if it wasn't going to work.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But right now we
feel very confident

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that every single
research study that we've

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.740 align:middle line:84%
done, every single condition
that we've thrown this at

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.090 align:middle line:90%
has been improved.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We haven't found anything
that it hasn't improved.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:45.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
the limits are.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It'd be nice if it was a
mechanistic world and we just

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:51.080 align:middle line:84%
tightened a bolt here and
there and then it worked.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:90%
But that's not.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:56.960 align:middle line:84%
We're way more than
a piece of machinery.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
we've begun to touch

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:03.620 align:middle line:84%
on the energy of what runs
the body or even, dare I say,

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.060 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual piece.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I never wanted it to go
into a spiritual direction.

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But really, I don't
know how you can stop it

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:13.190 align:middle line:84%
when you start analyzing
what's going on in this world.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the other interesting
piece about this is healing,

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:22.400 align:middle line:84%
healing is so interesting to me
in that we put on these layers

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and layers and layers of
protection of things that

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.810 align:middle line:90%
happened to us.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then a person will
come in with a problem

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and we'll start
peeling off the layers.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But what's totally
interesting to me

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is the issue won't come
up until the body's

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.520 align:middle line:90%
ready to deal with it.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know personally,
I lost my mother

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.980 align:middle line:90%
when I was six years old.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, you
know, I've had issues.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And over the years we've
done a bunch of NET

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and would often go back to
me being a six-year-old,

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.040 align:middle line:84%
of course, which is
when my mother died.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And we would check the
concept of my mother

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:90%
dying, committing suicide.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't there
for almost five years.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.710 align:middle line:90%
It'd be something else.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It'd be that I had to
go stay with my aunt

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:16.680 align:middle line:84%
or that it was my father was
so upset, or this or that.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And then interestingly,
five years into it,

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:25.190 align:middle line:84%
on a Mother's Day, believe it
or not, I had an issue come up,

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.720 align:middle line:90%
goes back to age six.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I was ready
to deal with the death

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and suicide of my mother.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.220 align:middle line:90%
So I think that is so wonderful.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And it gives a level
of safety to realize

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.650 align:middle line:84%
an issue is not going
to come up until you're

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.060 align:middle line:90%
ready to deal with it.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the most
interesting thing that happens,

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.980 align:middle line:84%
that has happened for
me as a practitioner,

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is that a person comes
in maybe for migraines,

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and you start doing NET
on them for the migraines,

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.092 align:middle line:84%
and then they start to tell
you the other things that are

00:51:58.092 --> 00:51:59.300 align:middle line:90%
getting better in their life.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Their relationships are better.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.120 align:middle line:90%
They're happier.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.300 align:middle line:90%
They're sleeping better.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't even take care of
those things, which again just

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.700 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the amazing
healing power of the body

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.800 align:middle line:90%
if you give it a chance.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.750 align:middle line:84%
if you take some of
these stress factors,

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:84%
you reduce that load that
the body is carrying,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.480 align:middle line:84%
the sky's the limit as
to what it can heal.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The one thing that we really
are helping people become is

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.160 align:middle line:84%
to become more comfortable
in their own skin.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
comfortable in our own skin,

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.360 align:middle line:84%
things are a bit less
stressful in life.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:84%
We're able to handle
things better.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.650 align:middle line:90%
We love ourself more.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And with that, there's nothing
that money or anything else

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:44.210 align:middle line:84%
can buy except that peace
of mind with yourself.

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine how the world could
be if we could actually become

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:51.740 align:middle line:84%
more aware of our stress and its
impact on not only our own body

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and ourselves but
those around us,

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and be able to hold a space of
acceptance and allow each of us

00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:01.820 align:middle line:84%
to reach our full potential
and be true authentic selves.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I wish that more people
were aware of this work.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the miracles that we
as practitioners get to see

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.670 align:middle line:90%
every day are amazing.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And people don't even realize.

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.860 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people out there
in this world that don't even

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.690 align:middle line:90%
realize it's a possibility.

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> As a result,
as a side effect,

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.680 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful side
effect from doing NET,

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I started to practice
yoga and meditation,

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:34.490 align:middle line:84%
understanding and teaching this
idea that your mind is very

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:35.450 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And it can help you or harm you.

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's always your choice.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I would probably
be an emotional wreck.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:49.810 align:middle line:84%
If I never had NET, I would
probably be a mess, honestly.

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And I used to be.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I used to be like my emotions
would just go up and down.

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that stuff also
correlates with your diet.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So just learning
about that stuff

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.370 align:middle line:90%
was a game changer for me.

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's helped so
much in every way.

>> Comments through your life
are stored up in your body.

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's bringing
that emotion out

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and to attack that
emotion almost loss

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and release it and
diffuse it from your body

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.350 align:middle line:90%
is, it's the biggest freedom.

years ago, I thought

that those of us that
believed that the power that

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
made the body is in the
body can heal the body,

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and that the body was natural
healing and that's what works,

00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.640 align:middle line:84%

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.780 align:middle line:84%
the stresses of life and it
can make us feel powerless.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Struggles with anxiety,
depression, and chronic health

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.550 align:middle line:84%
problems are becoming
more and more common.

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us has been through
traumatic events in our life

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that should
bring us together more instead

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.560 align:middle line:90%
of disconnecting us.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.200 align:middle line:84%
There are little to no treatment
options for people suffering

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:90%
from traumatic stress.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:49.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
diagnosed with PTSD

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.110 align:middle line:84%
or any other major
traumatic condition,

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.420 align:middle line:84%
it can seem confusing
on how to get help.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.790 align:middle line:84%
These findings are
about more than NET.

00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It's about helping
our society to become

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.440 align:middle line:84%
more aware of our emotions
and how much they actually

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.930 align:middle line:84%
affect our life and
the people around us.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The mind and the body
are intimately connected.

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
can embrace that,

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:84%
the more we can take
control of our health

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.849 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately take
control of our lives.

00:56:12.849 --> 00:56:15.723 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:56:15.723 --> 00:56:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of why brain imaging
is so valuable is that it shows

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.270 align:middle line:84%
the physiological
basis of things.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And we always joke about how you
can parade 100 people in front

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:33.540 align:middle line:84%
of a group of scientists
and they all say,

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.008 align:middle line:90%
this made me feel a lot better.

00:56:35.008 --> 00:56:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you throw up one brain
scan picture and you say,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.790 align:middle line:84%
well, this is what their
brain looked like initially

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:41.165 align:middle line:84%
and this is what their brain
looked like afterwards, they

00:56:41.165 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:90%
say, oh, OK, something happened.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the
subjective experiences

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that people describe,
you never really know.

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in a
very cynical world,

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, every
advertisement, every group

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is trying to make their
product, their approach,

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.410 align:middle line:90%
their ideas sound great.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So of course, there's
a million testimonials.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And every testimonial
always says, this was great,

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.590 align:middle line:84%
it changed my life,
I feel fabulous.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:06.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But to have actual
data and to be

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:11.610 align:middle line:84%
able to do it in a controlled
trial, a randomized controlled

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.500 align:middle line:84%
trial, and to be able
to see what's happening

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and then more specifically, to
show the physiological effect,

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that shows that there's
something else that's going on.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a person
could say to me,

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not having a response to it.

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know exactly what
they're feeling on the inside.

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not in the
scanner with them,

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.890 align:middle line:84%
so they could still
be in tears and just

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:34.620 align:middle line:84%
fighting it back better and
saying, no, I feel fine.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't be able to
change the brain that way.

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though it's obvious
that mind and body are one,

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.895 align:middle line:84%
we used to talk about
a mind body connection,

00:57:44.895 --> 00:57:47.610 align:middle line:84%
like I don't know, maybe
there was a rope or a chain

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:90%
connecting them or something.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there
was even a debate

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.100 align:middle line:84%
about whether or not there was
a connection prior to that.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.820 align:middle line:84%
We now know that they're the
flip side of the same coin,

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is a physiology
and a biology to things

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
mentally and emotionally.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And this study elucidates
that beautifully

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.840 align:middle line:84%
between both papers
and the effects

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.870 align:middle line:84%
that a distressing event has
on the brain and the rest

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:21.990 align:middle line:84%
of physiology, including the
autonomic nervous system,

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:25.290 align:middle line:84%
as well as subjective
ways that people feel.

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that when that
distressing event gets

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:34.860 align:middle line:84%
neutralized, to a large extent,
that all of those things

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:37.110 align:middle line:84%
change, that the brain
changes, that the rest

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:41.610 align:middle line:84%
of physiology changes, that
subjective feelings of stress

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and distress all change,
quality of life change.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's mind and body,
in that regard, are one.

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that this data is
very important in providing

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.740 align:middle line:84%
more knowledge about
the mechanism of action

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.150 align:middle line:84%
of the neuro
emotional technique.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to understand
better what it's doing,

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.330 align:middle line:84%
how it has an impact on
different parts of the brain,

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and how it helps the
person to regulate

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.460 align:middle line:90%
their emotional responses.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Now there could be some other
very interesting aspects,

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.710 align:middle line:84%
because the cerebellum is
involved in our body's movement

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and our motor function.

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It appears that it
also helps to regulate

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.410 align:middle line:84%
our autonomic
nervous system, which

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:23.310 align:middle line:84%
was another part of this study
that showed that not only do we

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:25.620 align:middle line:84%
change the way a person's
brain is reacting

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to the emotional trauma,
but we change the way

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.580 align:middle line:90%
the body reacts as well.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And the cerebellum apparently
is able to regulate

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.810 align:middle line:84%
the autonomic nervous system in
terms of regulating heart rate

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and blood pressure, which
were also measures that we

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.750 align:middle line:90%
were looking at in this study.

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, what we
were showing was

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:43.980 align:middle line:84%
was that after the neuro
emotional technique,

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.160 align:middle line:84%
people's heart rate responses
to the traumatic stimuli

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.190 align:middle line:90%
were much more normalized.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:51.180 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have that
kind of over reactivity

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that would that we
had seen before going

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.260 align:middle line:84%
through the neuro
emotional technique.

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that this
really opens up an ability

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to understand more and more
what the mechanism of action

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is of the neuro
emotional technique.

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It tells us a lot
about what we might

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.990 align:middle line:84%
be able to learn in terms
of just traumatic memories

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and traumatic and strong
negative emotions,

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.960 align:middle line:84%
how they play out in the
brain, what areas of the brain

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
seem to be involved in
them, and provides us

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.520 align:middle line:90%
a target for future studies.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, I do not like the
term "alternative health care."

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Bugs me, because this is
not alternative health care.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is almost more
traditional than any other type

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of health care that we have.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because really, it's
saying, OK, you've

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
got what it takes to heal.

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's unleash.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's unlock.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's help your body to heal.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:47.348 align:middle line:84%
>> If we start looking at
the body as mind as well,

01:00:47.348 --> 01:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the mind
that's in your head,

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
it's also the mind that's
down here in your gut,

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that is just as much at play in
terms of creating your health

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.160 align:middle line:90%
as the brain in your head.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We look at the body
as perfect the way it is.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a symptom
that's expressing,

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
it's because the
body needs something.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.950 align:middle line:90%
It needs attention in that area.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And emotions definitely
are not logical.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
They're not rational.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Emotions are non-rational.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.633 align:middle line:84%
They're not irrational,
but they're non-rational.

01:01:19.633 --> 01:01:20.800 align:middle line:90%
They just are what they are.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Most of the universe
is non-rational.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Most of the universe is not
working on a rational plane.

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Most of the universe
is just what it is.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Human beings apparently
have been given reason.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can work with our
reason to make life better

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:35.470 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But we can't rely
100% on reason.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that
we're more than reason.

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
The body heals itself.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And NET kind of facilitates
that and kind of

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.040 align:middle line:90%
makes it easier to do.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a process.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.350 align:middle line:84%
But through virtue
of this process,

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
it allows that which heals
to come forth and get

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:01.140 align:middle line:90%
the healing done.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, they say, oh,
you helped me so much.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I tried to
help you all right,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%
but your body healed itself.

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I just want to remind
you of that, you know,

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
so we can get that
consciousness going out there

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and start making that
part of the conversation.

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:28.864 align:middle line:90%
