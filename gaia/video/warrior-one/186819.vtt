00:00:01.494 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> There's such a safety and
a connection I had in nature--

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:84%
neutralizing and calming
nerves and just resetting,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:90%
replenishing, nurturing.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I led my first women's
empowerment program and rock

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
climbing camp when
I was 22 years old.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.742 align:middle line:84%
I knew many of my friends had
been victimized or assaulted.

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was always about them.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I could really
be there for them.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I always knew I was going to
be a therapist since I was 14.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I learned from me that
traditional psychotherapy

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
had its limits as far as
inspiration and impact.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I founded the
Wellfit Institute out

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.457 align:middle line:84%
of my personal and professional
experience of the healing

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that can occur through
challenges in nature.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Wellfit is adventure therapy.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Wellfit is the therapeutic
use of the wilderness

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:90%
or the outdoors.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the application
of these adventures

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and these challenges as being
so appropriate to everyday life.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Jill and I decided
that we would start with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.658 align:middle line:84%
women's leadership and
empowerment groups.

00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And so now we've been
doing that for three years.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Jill started talking about
the Wellfit Girls Challenge

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.280 align:middle line:90%
and what she wanted to do.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.083 align:middle line:90%
And I said, go for it.

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we found was
that it was really

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:90%
difficult to get to the teens.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Ellen and Bob Nicolls,
who are the founders

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of New Horizons in southwest
Florida, are friends of mine.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> 12 years ago, my husband
and I founded New Horizons

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
to really meet the needs of
at-risk children that live

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
in our community.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I called Ellen
and said, hey, Ellen.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
We have an empowerment,
leadership,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:90%
and fitness programs.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you can
get some girls for us?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And she said, give me a week.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And within a week, she
had eight girls for us.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.207 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Does anybody feel they're not
in the right place right now,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:90%
want to raise your hand?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.615 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere
else in the world

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
were meant to be than
right here, right now.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Who's in?

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm in.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:90%
High five, high five.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.635 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
All right, we're ready.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The mission of the
Wellfit Girls Challenge

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:84%
is to create a healthy,
empowering culture that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:90%
inspires your personal growth.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're confident if you can
commit to this, if you do--

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and I know you will
commit to this--

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.925 align:middle line:90%
you will come out transformed.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know what
the word holistic means?

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Another word for
that is integrated.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's many things
happening at once.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's what this program is.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It incorporates
personal growth with

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
interpersonal relationships
and your personal style

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:90%
of leadership.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you come
out of this, you're

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:84%
going to be ready to
take on new experiences,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.448 align:middle line:84%
and meet new people, and
have healthy relationships,

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:90%
and feel better about yourself.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's the ultimate goal.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:84%
The Peaks Foundation
took a similar age group

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of girls, just like
you, from Australia

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to Africa to climb a
mountain with a group

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of local girls in Tanzania.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
It was a perfect fit
with what I wanted to do.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:84%
The partnership with them makes
it possible for this leadership

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%
program to culminate in
an expedition to Peru.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
This five month program
is going to prepare

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you to immerse yourself in that
culture and get to know girls

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:90%
your age who live there.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
donate our time,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.397 align:middle line:84%
get to know their
families a little bit,

00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and explore the
sacred sites and hike

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and trek our way too Machu
Picchu, one of the seven

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:90%
wonders of the world.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So you get to go
have a big adventure,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
climb some mountains, and also
do some really good service

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:90%
work while you're there.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Alexis Buhelos.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm 14 years old.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:90%
I live in Florida.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And I go to Lely High School.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to go at first.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even going to lie.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know other girls.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be weird.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I'm going
to be able to go, and help

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
these girls, and just
spend time, and learn

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
about their culture,
and just how they live--

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:90%
is just amazing to me.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Not even that I'm so into
traveling or anything.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's girls
around the world who

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%
do the same things as I do.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's just cool to get a
different perspective of it.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to create an
expedition mentality to look

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
deep within ourselves, to
better ourselves through health,

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:84%
through nutrition, fitness,
and interpersonal discovery.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
commitment to others,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
which is going to allow us to
be successful as a team to go

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:90%
on this expedition to Peru.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do creative
expression, art, dance, yoga.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to work out and
do some amazing, fun training

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
stuff with Andrew.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It's challenging.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
going to get bored.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.007 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing
different things every week.

00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:17.549 align:middle line:84%
So I can already tell by looking
at each and every one of you

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.715 align:middle line:84%
that you're totally pumped
[LAUGHTER] and you're in.

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
an amazing time.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations to you.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I really believe in
sisterhood and girl power.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big
reason why I've created

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
these programs, these
transformational programs,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:90%
in a group setting.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.053 align:middle line:84%
Because we can do
a lot on our own.

00:05:36.053 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But when we are
witnessed and when

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
we share our transformation
with other girls

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
in the circle of equality
and sisterhood, so much more

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The girls that are
participating in this challenge

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
are girls that live in poverty.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> They have family issues.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%
They have illness.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Selena Tello.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm 18.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm almost going to be 19.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:90%
I live in Bonita Springs.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Where I come from, is Guatemala.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And my family's kind of
poor and all like that.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And kids my age,
they have to work

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.105 align:middle line:90%
instead of going to school.

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm always in
charge of my house,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:90%
because my mom works too.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
When I get from school,
I have to clean it.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I have to cook
and give my dad his food,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and my brothers, and then
get ready to go work.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm the older one and
the only girl in the family.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.377 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Why don't you have everybody
take two steps in and see what

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that does.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I think we're good.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready to fall.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> We're ready.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're born, your skull
is supposed to float around

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
in two pieces so
your brain can grow.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And mine was fused together.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So my brain was trying
to grow, but my skull

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
was kind of holding it back.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:90%
So I had to have surgery.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And they cut open
a couple spots.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of
pulled it apart.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had to wear a
helmet for a year or so.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, this is so cool.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Let her have her
experience, you guys.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> During the surgery
when I was really young,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I flatlined for six
or seven minutes.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.575 align:middle line:90%
It's strange and powerful.

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:90%
It's-- I think about it a lot.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Evelyn Pacheco.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I am 17 years old.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I go to Estero High School.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
My mom, I look up to her,
because she's a strong woman.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:90%
She cleans.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:84%
She works at a restaurant
and barefoot beach.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
When I told her about the
trip, she said, if you want to,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:90%
just go for it.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:90%
You can do anything.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.605 align:middle line:84%
She told me, you think
you can climb that?

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, of course I can.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.755 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for anything.

00:07:53.755 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:90%
She's my best friend.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm her best friend.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to create a
ritual that we're going to do

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:90%
at the end of every group.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:90%
We're going to tie a ribbon on.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to affirm
something about yourself.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something you
learned that day or something

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:90%
you feel proud of that day.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
affirm it by saying, I am.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And then we embody that.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I am proud.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the group is
going to say, yes, you are.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Alexis.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I am excited.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you are.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Riley.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I am ready.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you are.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:90%
>> I am happy.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you are.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I am confident.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you are.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm Riley Zuccarello.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And I go to Gulf
Coast High School.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a sophomore this year.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And I turned 16 in July.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of like one
from a tough love family.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:90%
I can kind of handle myself.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know how to take
jabs once in a while.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Being part of the model
United Nations team,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
we debate a lot about
not only key issues,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
but key issues in our world and
how we can solve those issues.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Going to Peru is also something
that's been one of my dreams.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm really focused
on international relations

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.423 align:middle line:84%
and helping those
in need and stuff.

00:09:15.423 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
But to meet the girls there
and just spend time with them,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and get to know how their way of
living is different from ours,

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.915 align:middle line:84%
I think that's going
to be really cool.

00:09:21.915 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> One day, a group of girls
came to Arusha all the way from

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Australia.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me and some of my
classmates to climb with them,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
to climb to the very
top of Mount Meru.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
We joined together in the
great takes on the challenge.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:90%
This is our story.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not the kind of
person who talks a lot.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to be by myself
and just alone like that.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I have never
done things like this.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to travel
to other countries.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have the
opportunity to do it.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I actually am really
grateful for this opportunity.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a challenge
for everybody else.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And they could do
stuff that they never

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:90%
thought they could done.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> This whole experience is an
opportunity for them to move

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
so far beyond
their comfort zone.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
They have to buy
into this challenge.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It was 11 years ago.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Captain Bob and Miss Ellen would
drive around and pick everyone

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:90%
up in their trucks.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And back then, it was
just the Superkids church,

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:90%
so we would only go on Sundays.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And my sophomore year,
I started working

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:90%
with the middle schoolers.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And now I tutor them from
4:00 to 6:00 after school.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I have a four year scholarship
to go to any university.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
In the fall, I plan
to enroll at FGCU

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and get into the
nursing program.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> My sister Maria's the
first person to go to college

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:90%
in our family.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:90%
She's really smart.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And the kids are excited to
work with her at New Horizons.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I heard about the
Wellfit program

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and going to Peru
through Miss Ellen.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing that makes me nervous
about the trip is the asthma.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it'll act up
over there, because everybody

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:84%
keeps asking me, what
about your asthma?

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure you can go?

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of brings me down.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenge that
I wanted to face.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I really
want to go on this.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.522 align:middle line:90%
And just got to be positive.

00:11:41.522 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm actually very excited.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it's my first
time out of the country.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of
nervous about it also.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not
going with anybody.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to going with
people who I know.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going with
family or anything.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.482 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of scary
at the same time.

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I've known Guadalupe since
we were about five years old.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:90%
We went to preschool together.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then, we've
just always been close.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And we've grown up.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone
through the flood.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:84%
The mobile home park that
we lived in got flooded.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:90%
It was after Tropical Storm Fay.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> In my parents' bedroom,
it was all flooded.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And we woke up with this alarm.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> My parents came into my
room telling us to get all

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
our stuff, to get as
much as we could get out.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:90%
We lost family albums.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:90%
We lost a lot of clothes.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
We had to leave all
our schoolbooks.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> My mom heard about
the Estelle Rec Center,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
which was a shelter for the
families who were affected.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up
living at the shelter

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.098 align:middle line:90%
for two to three months.

00:12:40.098 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And we spent maybe 2 and
1/2 months in Germain Arena

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
sleeping on cots, just with
maybe 100 other people that

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:90%
lived in the camp too.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
By the end of those
two months, we

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
found out that most of the
homes were not up to regulation

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
They were all destroyed.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And there was mold everywhere.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So we had to move out.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Our dog actually
got lost there too.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.343 align:middle line:90%
We had to leave him behind.

00:13:02.343 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> He was running
around the whole time.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And he would hide underneath
the trailer with all the water.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And Naples news
ran a story on us.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And they found him.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:90%
And we got him back after that.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In sixth grade,
it was a challenge.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Because my parents were
not fluent in English

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't help
me with homework.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:90%
I had really bad grades--

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:90%
D's, C's.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I started New Horizons
when I was in eighth grade.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
been having A's and B's.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
The scholarship program, I got
it from Take Stock in Children

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:90%
by the help of Miss Ellen.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Without her, I couldn't
have gotten it.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a four
year paid scholarship.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.912 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big deal.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not all going
to be on the same page.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not all going to
be perfect right away.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:90%
But you can't talk.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do walking
lunges down to the curb.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:90%
My name is Andrew Miranti.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the head strength
and conditioning coach here

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
at Total Athletic Performance
in Naples, Florida.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
Wellfit Girls Challenge.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
lose sight that it

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.885 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a challenge.

00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You may have to help
the person next to you.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think that
it's going to be easy.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is,
it's not going to be.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't climb
smooth mountains.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, who doesn't
want to get in shape?

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, a professional
boy trainer person

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
who just works out--
and be like, OK, we're

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:90%
doing this for us.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the girls
once a week for an hour.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And we just get them ready
both mentally and physically

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.525 align:middle line:84%
for the challenges they're
going to have up ahead in Peru.

00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I really respond
to challenges well,

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.804 align:middle line:84%
because everybody needs a
little bit of competitiveness--

00:14:40.804 --> 00:14:41.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect, ladies.

00:14:41.604 --> 00:14:42.572 align:middle line:90%
Now switch.

00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:43.372 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Switch.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --to just do above and beyond
and just push that extra mile.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember, your
teammate up here--

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.528 align:middle line:84%
Some the physical training
that we're doing with them

00:14:50.528 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is just primarily
bodyweight-- squats, push-ups,

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.667 align:middle line:84%
a lot of core work, a
lot of endurance work,

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
just because I know
that they're going

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.628 align:middle line:90%
to be on this eight day hike.

00:14:58.628 --> 00:15:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And we want to make
sure that they're

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.305 align:middle line:90%
in the best shape possible.

00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
need to truly build

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
a team if they expect to finish,
and all of them to finish.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to be successful?

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Me.

00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
What if all a sudden you got
the phone call that said,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.778 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer part of
this great opportunity.

00:15:14.778 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take that
privilege away from you.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Every single day when an
opportunity is given to you,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.200 align:middle line:84%
when something's in
front of you, take it.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Because one day, it's
not going to be there.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You're creating a pathway
for other girls to do something

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:90%
You are the example.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:90%
You're setting that.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:90%
How empowering?

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes, Alexis.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I have ADHD.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I like to be in control a lot.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I kind
of yell and stuff.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's all in trying to just
be the better person, I guess.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had numerous
conversations with Alexis

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and with her mom saying, I
don't feel comfortable with

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:90%
your participation.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I was diagnosed with
anxiety and depression.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And seeing that depression
turned into self-harm.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to make sure that
this isn't who you are.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:84%
You aren't the person who
wants to hurt themselves.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
You're the person who wants
to be happy, and love life,

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and just do all the things
that the seven-year-old wanted

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:90%
to do in you.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to say, I can't
do this to myself anymore.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we feel empowered,
the more we empower others.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this is all about.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We want to provide kids with
a new horizon in their lives,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
to lift them out of the
poverty that surrounds them,

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and the crime, and the gang
and drug activity that is all

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:90%
around them, day to day.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Right face.

00:16:37.402 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Forward march.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>> My mom, she came to the
United States pregnant with me.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:90%
They came with nothing.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So then she had to work while
she was still pregnant with me.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
My last quarter grades, I
came up with all straight A's.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Forward halt.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was like really excited
to tell my mom about that.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted
to show her that

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to take her out of the
place where she's at right now.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.777 align:middle line:84%
I want to make her life better
than what it was before.

00:17:05.777 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
I don't want her to
struggle no more.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient Sanskrit
word yoga means to unite.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.965 align:middle line:84%
We practice yoga to integrate
mind, body, and spirit.

00:17:32.965 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Through the physical effort
and empowerment of yoga,

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:84%
we create new possibilities
for ourselves.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
We become more present to
and accepting of our lives

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:84%
for what they are and
what they are not.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Connection with self and others
is the ultimate goal of yoga.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Because this was leadership
and empowerment based,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I came on pretty strong in
what the behavioral commitments

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our commitments
was to show up on time and be

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:90%
prepared.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And that one really
stuck out to me.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.305 align:middle line:84%
Because I chose Wellfit
over my band practices.

00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What I've seen with
these girls is they've taken

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.112 align:middle line:84%
ownership of these behavioral
commitments as we've progressed

00:18:21.112 --> 00:18:21.945 align:middle line:90%
through the program.

00:18:21.945 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:90%
So we come in.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:90%
We want to come into our space--

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
coming into our
space and actually

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
being here for each other.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
The important goal
here is for the girls

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:90%
to practice generous listening.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
A big part of being
with and for each other

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.952 align:middle line:90%
is generous listening.

00:18:45.952 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The last thing I cried
about was about my brother.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because a while back
ago, he got arrested.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were afraid that he
was going to get deported.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he's my only male
role model I have in my life.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Kendall.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:84%
If she could be any animal,
she would be a dragon.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.402 align:middle line:84%
And she could
breathe fire on the

00:19:04.402 --> 00:19:05.608 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:05.608 --> 00:19:08.895 align:middle line:84%
>> I could breathe fire on
people that I didn't like.

00:19:08.895 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Ellen came to me and said,
I have concerns about Eloisa.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think her attitude
is where it needs to be.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I have seen Eloisa
from the beginning

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
a demure, behind-the-scenes,
hiding girl.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There's two years that
I had gone without talking

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to my sisters or my
parents that much.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Because there's this family
situation that had happened.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And they took the other
family member's side.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So I lost trust in
them, because they

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
were more worried about
that person instead of me.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I really took note of
that after Ellen said.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've kind of given
her more attention

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and put her on the
hook, basically.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.347 align:middle line:90%
Put her on the hook.

00:19:58.347 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's your best friend?

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And name a few
things about them.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's Evelyn
and my two sisters.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.955 align:middle line:84%
They've been through
a lot with me.

00:20:08.955 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> They've just been there?

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Eloisa has been forced
to speak with other people,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
look at other people in the eye,
communicate, share of herself.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And that space
could have allowed

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Maria to have a renewed
sense of compassion,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:84%
empathy, maybe even
respect for Eloisa

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that she's emerging
as her own person

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.363 align:middle line:90%
and not so reliant on her.

00:20:35.363 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've seen.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm enlightened by everyone.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I am grateful.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm brave.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you are.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The girls don't like
running, most of them.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Andrew came up to me, our
fitness guru, and he said,

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.600 align:middle line:90%
they're not ready.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:90%
This isn't going to happen.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:90%
He was very concerned.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
And that day we were running.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, run them again.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were regularly
walking during a half a mile

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:90%
run.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of a very big workout,

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
he said, hey, we've got
a special guest today.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh, who?

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your
special guest is reality.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Get out and run another mile.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
My inspiring friends,
Lulu and Evelyn,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:90%
hosted our final group session.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to start
painting here today.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Then it's dry.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we will give
this to you before you go.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Exercise your gifts, your
powers, your love for humanity.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Just go and paint
whatever you want.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Zumba?

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.238 align:middle line:90%
Zumba!

00:21:54.238 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Step back.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no rhythm.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Four, three, two, and one.

00:21:59.932 --> 00:22:00.928 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:01.728 align:middle line:90%
Hold it.

00:22:01.728 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Now four.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.186 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Give me some shoulders.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.598 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:14.566 align:middle line:90%
Move it back!

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:20.475 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I am excited.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you are.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I am proud.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I am so blessed.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Grateful.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Curious.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Empowered.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Happy.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.199 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm full of love.

00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:30.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:22:30.999 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a biopsy done.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And it came back positive.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what that
would mean for me, what

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:90%
it would mean for the program.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Debby has been an
incredible partner.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
This cancer diagnosis, of
course, was devastating.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I immediately said to her,
take care of yourself.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Your health comes first.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I support you in
any decision you make.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> This diagnosis is certainly
making me but Debby first.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And so now it's, Debby's going.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also going for
Jill and the girls.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.282 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.282 --> 00:23:11.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Listen up.

00:23:11.226 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Listen up, everybody.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Once you get your bag, I want
you to know what's in it.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> With the trip just days
away, the girls were given

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
their expedition
bags and hiking gear.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
All the elements of the
pre-planning expedition

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:84%
phase, what I wanted to see
has really been accomplished.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
in all honesty,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
when I accepted 11 girls, I
really only expected eight.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Not one of them dropped out.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was absolutely certain
we were going to lose three.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been through a lot
of things with this group.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.118 align:middle line:84%
I've had to learn
to come together.

00:23:49.118 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's helped me a lot.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And I want to show people,
you're not always alone.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> If you fear, you bring
the negative things in you.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:90%
So I don't think like that.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Six of them have
never been on a plane.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like to see
myself a more confident self.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to benefit from it, just
to know that the girls in Peru

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:90%
will benefit from it.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Amazing how people live
right next to Machu Picchu

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and don't even ever
get to climb it.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't imagine that.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> These girls, they have had
enough adversity in their life

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
that they can face
and handle a lot.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.070 align:middle line:84%
We've prepared them that this
is going to be uncomfortable,

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.843 align:middle line:84%
and to get comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

00:24:44.843 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
This phase of the
journey away from home

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
initiates the next
level of the challenge.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Leaving their comforts and
the world they know behind,

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the girls will never
be the same as they

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
travel to a new place
within themselves.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:25:07.896 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Jane and Selvy founded Peru's
Challenge to benefit the local

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:84%
They have been working
with the girls who

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:84%
will join us to carefully
select the hardest

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
working and most prepared
girls for this expedition.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They will be our guides
while we're here.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Being in partnership
allows us to do much more

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
that we could do on our own.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, girls.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.272 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've had a
nice lunch and it makes

00:26:19.272 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
you feel a little bit better.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Great, thank you.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Number one thing in regards
to living at attitude is water.

00:26:26.672 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We should be trying
to drink around

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.673 align:middle line:90%
two liters of water a day.

00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is to try
and drink as much coca tea

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Three cups of day would
be probably a good idea,

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
because the coca leaves
from the mountains--

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:90%
tradition from here--

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
are also really good for
dealing with the altitude.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:90%
So just keep drinking.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first got to
Peru, I was feeling--

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I got headaches.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't eat.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I feel like throwing up.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you may not feel
100% just getting to altitude.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
over before you know it.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.406 align:middle line:84%
So let's make the
most of every moment.

00:27:00.406 --> 00:27:01.362 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:27:01.362 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Arriving here
from the airport,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I just think Lupita started
crying, just looking at people.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I think just because
we think we're so--

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Less fortunate.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, like we have nothing.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.857 align:middle line:90%
And then you see them.

00:27:14.857 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And they really
have nothing here.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
We kind of feel
selfish and spoiled.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
That was the hardest
part, I think.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> For both of us, yeah.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.326 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:24.326 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been a wellness
coach with the girls.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping them
to begin to start

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:84%
learning about
self-care-- eating

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:84%
well, hydrating themselves,
just generally thinking

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
about themselves and
taking care of themselves.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Altitude sickness
can affect anybody,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:84%
even if you're in
really good shape,

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and eat really well,
and stay hydrated.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But experience is
the best teacher.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We love everybody who
brought us to this place.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It touched me so much to see and
meet so many of your parents,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
taking this huge risk of
their own feeling of comfort

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:90%
to let you out into this world.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they know there's
something bigger for you

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:90%
to learn, and explore, and grow.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole world of home
that's here with you right now.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.088 align:middle line:84%
But this is your chance
to fully take this in.

00:28:17.088 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that whatever you're
feeling, there's no right.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no wrong.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:84%
There just is a sense of
being, and total exploration,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.357 align:middle line:90%
and curiosity, and adventure.

00:28:29.357 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're here.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:43.258 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.258 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning and welcome.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the Plaza
de Armas of Cusco.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the
main principal plazas

>> For many of our
Peruvian girls,

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:84%
it was the first
time riding in cars,

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:84%
especially for any
length of time.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of them suffered
from motion sickness

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:84%
on the way up to
the sacred valley.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.670 align:middle line:84%
We had a slow ride there,
stopping to take care of them

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:53.060 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
We will climb to more
than 15,000 feet higher

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
than any of the girls
have ever been and higher

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:90%
than any peak in the US.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We founded the Peaks
Foundation with the intention

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of organizing mountain-based
expeditions for women and girls

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to raise funds for
female-focused initiatives

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.940 align:middle line:84%
in local mountain-based
communities.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:84%
We believe mountains are a
unique tool for empowerment.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.790 align:middle line:84%
They're the perfect
metaphor to life.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:90%
You need to work hard.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:25.490 align:middle line:90%
You need to work together.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:90%
You need to communicate.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
You need to be
present in the moment.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And you need to make
quick decisions.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We were very passionate about
helping local communities--

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:84%
most importantly,
the women and girls

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.360 align:middle line:90%
who live in these communities.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, you're
not always guaranteed

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.900 align:middle line:84%
to reach the summit, which is
a very important life lesson.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Arriving at the trailhead,
the girls are confronted with

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:90%
fear and apprehension.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have been suffering
with headaches, insomnia,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:84%
loss of appetite,
and vomiting in Cusco

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.770 align:middle line:90%
over the past several days.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:06.940 align:middle line:84%
They soon realized the trail
only ascends from here.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.390 align:middle line:84%
None of them have ever
hiked, let alone at altitude,

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:13.440 align:middle line:90%
carrying backpacks.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Chalo.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been organizing
and leading this treks

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.720 align:middle line:84%
through the Andes for 40 years,
especially for kids, girls.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:84%
You're coming here and you have
to face this big challenge,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:90%
which is doable.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:90%
I always tell them it's doable.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's a huge
challenge for them,

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:84%
coming out of
their comfort zone.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning,
they're quite afraid.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And going through all this,
they start to grow and realize

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:90%
all what they can learn.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
My role here is
being the backup.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They have to do
everything by themselves.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be sure that
the food, the camping,

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:90%
and everything is there.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And along the trek, during the
day, I have to shore them up.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.120 align:middle line:90%
That's my main role.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of
challenging to me, too.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:90%
But I know how is the end.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm always
optimistic with them,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:84%
because I know they're
going to do it.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
If they need a little bit
of help, we supply the help.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:16.195 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.195 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Me and Maria, we thought
that it was going to be easy.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.012 align:middle line:84%
So we were up front
and at a fast pace.

00:43:21.012 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we didn't
realize it would

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.553 align:middle line:90%
get hotter and everything.

00:43:23.553 --> 00:43:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Then we'd be running
out of water.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Then we started falling behind.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Within an hour, a few of
the girls couldn't even carry

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.940 align:middle line:90%
their day packs.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The adults took turns
carrying two packs

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.512 align:middle line:90%
to lighten their load.

I feel like I'm
going to throw up.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:90%
It might make you feel better.

I can throw up.

have to, but you can't.

You think you can actually walk?

I'm going to leave you
this water for her.

Machu Picchu means only "old

>> When I started this,
I wasn't a fitness girl.

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for me, because
I don't like to run.

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's too much for me.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I was like, I'm going to be
the first one to quit and be

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.570 align:middle line:90%
sick and--

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:15.085 align:middle line:90%
not going to make it.

01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:17.390 align:middle line:90%

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%

group again today.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.630 align:middle line:90%
You're rocking it.

01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud of you.

>> I was amazed to see myself
that I didn't get sick.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I was always in the front.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what is
wrong with me, you know?

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.890 align:middle line:90%
I never saw myself like that.

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Selena and I got
assigned as roommates.

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We stayed up all night just
talking about everything.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
To see how hardworking she is
and all the things that she's

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
had to overcome, and being
able to let myself become more

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable and letting her know
the challenges that I faced,

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it made us really
connected in that way.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really one to share
a lot of things in my life.

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to
find how gratifying it

01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is to have deep
connections with people.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Alexis was having
a really hard time.

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I told her that I was going to
stick with her no matter what.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We really helped each
other out, and we

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:09.260 align:middle line:90%
stuck by each other's side.

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was one of
the most important things

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.200 align:middle line:90%
on the trip.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I was slowing down.

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.540 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.470 align:middle line:90%
I felt sore.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone was, but I
was suffering in my own way.

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:19.370 align:middle line:90%
I go slow.

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I go at my own pace.

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Without Riley, I don't know
if I could have finished this.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Without her
encouragement, I wouldn't

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
have had the good mindset I did
have going down this mountain.

01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm so thankful to
have a friend like her.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We're climbing
up the mountain.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I start feeling
confused, like I

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.870 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I was really scared
at that point.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So the first person that
I went to was my sister.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I don't
think I'm going to make it.

01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:50.482 align:middle line:84%
That's what was running
through my head the whole time.

01:15:50.482 --> 01:15:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I looked up, and I saw
them walking her back.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I just knew right away that she
was having trouble breathing.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to show her
that I was scared, because I

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.090 align:middle line:90%
was really scared for her.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So I tried to stay calm.

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just told her that
I knew she could do it,

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and that she was strong, and
that she could keep going.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Since some family issues
had been going on, and I had no

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
family for two years, going
on this trip and bonding

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:19.070 align:middle line:90%
and talking--

01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:20.570 align:middle line:90%
we got really close.

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I have
my sister back now.

your mind to, and
helping others,

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%

one little girl.

01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
She was kind of shy, and
it reminded me of me.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to give her
confidence to talk to me.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It made me feel inspired.

01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:59.315 align:middle line:84%
And it also made me feel like I
could open someone up and show

the trip was going up,

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the little kids being
happy, and calling us amigos,

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.630 align:middle line:90%

was kind of proud of myself.

Because I thought I wasn't
going to be able to do it.

01:17:44.547 --> 01:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
When I came back to
the United States,

breathe on top of it,

above bullying, or
depression, or anything.

I can still rise above that.
