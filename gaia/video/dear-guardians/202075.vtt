at you with this stupid

the thing work apparently.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So what I always start with
is the mission statement

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple Guardians, which
is that Temple Guardians hold

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
the space at the Temple,
maintaining an environment that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
allows equal access for
everyone to have the experience

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and expression that they need
and to keep the Temple itself,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:84%
as well as the participants
who visit it, safe.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a second
to think about that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.695 align:middle line:84%

and hope of what we do.

much an honor to be a Guardian.

to volunteer to give back

often tell people,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%

it to be at the moment that

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.853 align:middle line:90%
they are there.

>> And they put the things down.

And then they walk out lighter.

And in a lot of ways, it's
kind of like the miracle

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple.

Think about this,
because what it means

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you're the human
embodiment of the Temple.

do several times was just offer

support in the form of a hug.

Even just opening my
arms as an invitation.

some things, grieving.

The amount of support and
love that was given to me

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:90%
was amazing.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%

when we're needed,

aren't, that is the heart

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:90%
of what we do.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the work that we do.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.203 align:middle line:90%

It's something
that's very special.

But the thing that the Guardians
do on the night of the Temple

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
burn, I think, goes so
far beyond what happens

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:90%
after the Temple burn begins.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And the crowd quiets down.

And everyone is just
watching the Temple burn.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're there, and
you're being with the crowd,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:84%
really making yourself a part of
them while you're watching them

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%

dancing in their eyes.

to my Guardians, I'm like,

look, the thing behind you,
that's a structural fire.

there for you if you put
yourself with that crowd

is everything.
