00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.759 align:middle line:84%
>> One time, we had a small
plane go down somewhere

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:90%
in Africa.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And we were not able to
find it by surveillance.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:10%
So the director of the CIA heard
about a woman in California

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:10%
that was a medium or something.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't know the title for her.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:10%
And she gave him the latitude
and longitude of the plane's

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:10%
whereabouts, and we
located the plane

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:10%
where she said it was lost.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
time that I have ever

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:84%
experienced something
that was inexplicable

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.024 align:middle line:90%
while I was President.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:10%
>> He was the most
psychic man in the world,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:10%
but nobody seems to
know what killed him.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It began with Russell Targ.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The physicist in the beret
there appeared at my door

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:90%
with a box of documents.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is marker 701.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.345 align:middle line:84%
This is where the caretaker
told me I should start.

00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to see what this.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is marker 700.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, Pat's grave
is entirely unmarked.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I think he deserved
better than that.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
This is probably
my last opportunity

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
to say goodbye to
my good friend Pat.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:10%
Pat Price often said,
the more attention

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:10%
you place on hiding
something, the more it shines

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:10%
like a beacon in psychic space.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Pat Price died in 1975,
and some people believe it was

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
because of his work
with remote viewing.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Psychic spies.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Cold War whimsy,
or secret weapon?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people may have
certain psychic powers.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:90%
This may reassure you.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It may alarm you.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:10%
But in fact, for some years now,
the US intelligence community

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:10%
has wagered a modest amount
of money on the possibility

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.605 align:middle line:10%
that such powers do exist.

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Such powers do exist.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Do exist.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But the most
enduring experiments

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
have been in the field
of remote viewing.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
We got into it
when we discovered

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
that they were in it.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>> We've found that many
individuals are able

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:10%
to accurately describe what's
going on in distant locations

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:10%
blocked from any kind
of ordinary perception.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.193 align:middle line:10%


00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you saying that the
work you've been doing is

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:10%
classified?

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I really can't talk about
matters of classification,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:10%
as you can imagine.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:84%
My name is Russell Targ,
and I'm a physicist.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
This is our last chance
to tell our story.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been on a road trip
like this for many years.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
They always assume that
people are immortal.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I hope the people who have seen
and used apparational material

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
will say yes, that
really happened.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
A huge trove of material
was declassified by the CIA,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
so this is really the first
time that the people who

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
were cognizant of secret
material can talk about it.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> At one time, humanity
worshipped fire.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The shamans called it magic,
and the people feared it.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And now science recognizes
fire as simply another part

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Ideas change based
on new evidence.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:90%
The fear of the unknown remains.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The future, the future,
it all looms very large.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What if psychic
abilities were real?

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
What if you could
look anywhere using

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.970 align:middle line:90%
only the power of your mind?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And if these abilities really
exist, what would that do

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:90%
to the world when it found out?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
The CIA financed
a project in 1975

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to develop a new
kind of agent who

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:90%
could truly be called a spook.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Dad, when you told me that
you were interested in using

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
classified materials, that you
were eager to get them out,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and you were, I was
principally concerned for you.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And our family, no doubt.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No doubt.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:10%
We received a
letter from the CIA,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:10%
and said sorry,
not now, but later.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, Nicholas, I'm just
going to publish the book.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
that what could

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:84%
be more important than
to help my father one,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
get the documents
that he was seeking,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
but also to help make sure
that he stayed out of jail?

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.793 align:middle line:84%
So that all seemed like a
very worthwhile enterprise.

00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very good thinking.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I then contacted the
congresswoman in Palo Alto,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and she submitted a letter
on your behalf as well.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's very nice.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Several months later, the CIA
released the documents that we

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:10%
had requested, and you were able
to tell me the story in full

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:10%
detail.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.846 align:middle line:84%
>> If I taught you to expect a
miracle, it's been worthwhile.

00:06:53.846 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:10%
With the floodgates now open,
an additional 70,000 documents

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:10%
on remote viewing
were declassified.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I can now show
everybody these pictures

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
without having to
kill them afterwards.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You can actually take out
of thin air information

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
about something you have
absolutely no access

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:90%
to just using your mind.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
If we want to know why the CIA
was lying about our program,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we should go to
Detroit and talk to Kit Green,

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:90%
our former contract monitor.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.055 align:middle line:84%
He was Branch Chief of the
Life Sciences Division at CIA.

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I was given the results.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:84%
The drawings showed the ability
of a visual representation

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that appeared to be better
than overhead imagery.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
In Pat Price's
drawings, it was as

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
if it was from inside his
brain that the information was

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
coming, not from his eyeballs
overhead looking down.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>> It was obvious to any
intelligence organization that

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:10%
if you had an ability to be
able to remotely perceive stuff,

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:10%
really remotely, like
any place in the world,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:10%
that could be an extraordinary
intelligence source.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:10%
>> The remote viewing program
basically ran from the early

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:10%
'70s to the mid-'90s.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:10%
>> For more than 20 years,
the CIA used psychic abilities

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:10%
operationally and in a top
secret program for the US

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.817 align:middle line:10%

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:90%
You paid for them.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:90%
You deserve to see them.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> CIA said cease and desist.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
People said, this
stuff was so intriguing

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:90%
that we got back into the game.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> "We once found a guy that
could see anywhere in the world

through his psychic powers.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
We could show him a
picture of any place,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and he could describe any
activity going on there.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:10%
But he died, and we haven't
heard from him since."

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:10%
CIA director Stansfield Turner,
"Chicago Tribune," August 1977.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:10%
>> As I believe, when he
died, he was out in Las Vegas

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:10%
or something, and Kit
Green rushed out there.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:10%


00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Even though he died
unattended in a hotel room,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:10%
you don't need to make it
a medical examiner case,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:10%
although that's not correct.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:10%
And he was taken
to the emergency

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:10%
room, which I visited.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:10%
Speaking now as a
criminologist, I

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:10%
would have investigated
the hell out of it.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>> But the water is
a little bit murky.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to
change to a bigger fly

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:10%
that they can see better.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:10%
Oh, there we go.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:90%
We got one.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.415 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you do with
it after you catch it?

00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Catch and release only.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The cutthroats are
now pretty endangered,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:90%
so you can't keep them.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Where the red is, it's
like his throat's been cut.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Ken Kress was our long-term
contract monitor at CIA.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:90%
He was a physicist.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Ken Kress became a mythic figure
when he wrote a long paper

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:84%
in the annals of intelligence
describing our program,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:90%
but he's never come forward.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Kress had never been
interviewed before this film,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and every question we asked
had to be submitted for vetting

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
by the CIA.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I was undercover.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:10%
The fact that CIA was even
doing anything with SRI

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:10%
was confidential information.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:10%
>> So Sid Gottlieb
looked around,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:10%
came up with my name
because I was a physicist,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:10%
and he called me in
and he said, well,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to take
over this project.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said the reason is
there's two physicists at SRI,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.463 align:middle line:84%
and I think you three
can probably communicate.

00:11:24.463 --> 00:11:29.585 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:10%
>> The first series of
experiments here at Stanford

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.225 align:middle line:10%
researchers did were what
the scientists called remote

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:35.025 align:middle line:10%
viewing.

00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, here
is a re-enactment

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of one of the first
experiments last year.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:10%
The subject was a New York
artist named Ingo Swann.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
He was in the room.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
The experimenters, doctors
Harold Puthoff and Russell

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Targ, were driving
away in a car.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Their destination was
in a sealed envelope.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
This day, it was
Palo Alto City Hall.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The subject did not know,
but back in the room,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
the subject began
sketching and describing

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%
where he imagined they might be.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Here was the tape recording
that he made them.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:10%
>> There must be buildings
around, in sort of an area,

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:10%
enclosed of some sort,
a quadrangle or a quad.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:10%
And then I sort of
thought that there

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:10%
might be a fountain around, but
I didn't hear any water in it.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a fountain.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
That day, it was turned off.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Back in the room, the subject
sketched a pattern he thought

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
was crosswalks coming
together in a circle.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the courtyard
is paved in this pattern.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
The courtyard where
they were is two miles

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
from the room where
the subject was.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
There had been no
communication between them.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow or another, Kit
Green and Ingo got together.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Kit came up with a report,
and he sent this back

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
circulating through the CIA, and
eventually got to Sid Gottlieb.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Gottlieb was already
predisposed to look

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
at the psychic phenomena
from 10 years ago.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:10%
>> As the CIA's sorcerer,
Gottlieb attempted to raise

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:10%
assassination to an art form.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:10%
Out of his labs had come
many debilitating potions.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We knew who Sid Gottlieb
was, the director of the famous

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:90%
MKUltra program.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:10%
This is by 1974.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:10%
MKUltra was the CIA's
notorious mind control program

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:10%
in the 1950s and '60s, where
they were giving LSD to people

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:10%
to see if you could create
a Manchurian Candidate

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and strip away their memories.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
We considered him
sort of the Josef

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Mengele of the American side.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Mengele of course, was a
notorious Nazi physician

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
who did biological experiments
on Jewish prisoners.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Gottlieb was not doing that.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Gottlieb of course is Jewish.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
He was just torturing other
people independent of race

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:90%
or religion.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
He is sort of an equal
opportunity misanthrope.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
From my point of
view, he reminded me

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of my old uncle Sid.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.396 align:middle line:84%
>> When he died, he was out
in Las Vegas or something.

00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:90%
He was out in Las Vegas.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:10%
>> In early 1972 I briefed
NASA and the CIA on proposed

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:10%
experiments to help people
develop their psychic

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:10%
abilities.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, Hal and I thought it would
be very interesting to meet

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:90%
with Sid Gottlieb.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:10%
He was enthusiastic
about the idea

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:10%
of giving remote viewers
LSD as a way of enhancing

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:10%
their psychic abilities.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I was opposed to that.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing requires a
person's conscious cooperation,

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and we explained
that to Gottlieb,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and he seemed to
completely understand.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So he led us down into the
basement of the Pentagon,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and it seemed to us that he was
sort of stored in the basement

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:90%
with all of his books.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The only really
comfortable place

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:90%
we'd ever been in the CIA.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The idea, after
talking to Gottlieb,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that the decision to give
us money to go forward

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:90%
probably had already been made.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Reports that the Soviets
were using psychics to spy on us

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
prompted us to do
the same to them.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There was intelligence,
hard intelligence.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, intelligence that was
like, really, really good.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Internal program intelligence
about what the Soviets were

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:84%
doing in medicine and psychology
that stated that they believed

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that United States military,
the United States intelligence

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
officers, and United
States scientists

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
would be ripe for
recruitment as spies

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
if they were interested
in crazy things

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
like psychic research, remote
viewing, and parapsychology.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.978 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell
their government

00:16:05.978 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
people that were responsible
for doing recruiting

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, hey, if
you want to find somebody

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:84%
in the Washington, DC area that
might be pretty interesting,

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.737 align:middle line:84%
find somebody that spends their
time doing psychic research.

00:16:17.737 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> They must have been following
Russ around constantly, then.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's natural for a visually
handicapped person like me

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to be interested
in optics, magic,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%
and extrasensory perception.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm a legally blind,
motorcycle-riding physicist.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:90%
In 1934, I was born in Chicago.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:90%
I was a child magician.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I used to perform magic tricks
at birthday parties and art

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
openings.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
As a magician, I understand
how people can be tricked.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
That's always made me a
better researcher, especially

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
in a field like ESP.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:10%
I left graduate school
at Columbia in 1956,

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:10%
and in 1958, I began
working on the earliest

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.560 align:middle line:10%
development of the laser.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:10%
I was looking for a way
to get into some kind

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.644 align:middle line:10%
of psychical research and
still support my family.

00:17:12.644 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:10%
>> Russell was enthusiastic,
and Hal was more like what you

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:10%
would expect a
theoretician to be,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.332 align:middle line:10%
but they both came
across as physicists.

00:17:27.332 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I heard that there was going
to be a lecture at Stanford

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:10%
University, and there was a
young physicist, Hal Puthoff,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:10%
giving a lecture on Psychic
Discoveries Behind the Iron

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:10%
Curtain, American
and Russian ESP.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:10%
And I then went back and talked
to my new friend Hal Puthoff

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:10%
and said I think I've got
some dough, let's talk

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:10%
to your management about
creating a program.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
would be very nice.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You just have to promise that
you'll keep a low profile.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was in June
of 1972, and this

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
led to the beginning
of our program

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
at SRI to investigate
psychic abilities.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I looked forward
to coming to work.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Every day had a new miracle.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the child magician
finally got a job doing magic.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>> As we were doing
these experiments,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.735 align:middle line:84%
we began to run into flack
from the psychologists at SRI.

00:18:25.735 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They said, you know,
you've got that crazy ESP

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:90%
experiments going on.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
ruin our reputation.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.133 align:middle line:90%
We're going to lose our funding.

00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of those guys.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Hal had worked for several
years in Naval Intelligence

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, and that may
have made him a little more

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:90%
secretive indeed.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I had access to one of
the most shielded experiments

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
It was a shielded
magnetometer that

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:90%
measures weak magnetic fields.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Against his better judgment,
Hal snuck his very first

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
subject into a forbidden
lab at Stanford.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
The man claimed to be the
greatest psychic in the world.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:90%
And his name was Ingo Swann.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Swann claimed that he
could move the needle

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of an unswayable
magnetometer buried

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
under 30 feet of concrete with a
classified design used to sniff

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:90%
out nuclear explosions.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It even had
superconducting shielding.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Its claim to fame was that
nothing from the outside

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:90%
could affect it.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Not only could Ingo
perfectly sketch the design,

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:10%
but the needle moved.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:10%
It nearly got them
kicked out Stanford

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:10%
for breaking an experiment.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And that got the
attention of the CIA.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.018 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked the CIA agents,
why are you looking me up?

00:19:43.018 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:10%
And he says, well, we couldn't
care less about the fact

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.560 align:middle line:10%
that he perturbed that
magnetometer, but the fact

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:10%
that he could look through
superconducting shielding

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:10%
and see what was inside.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%
That is really a concern.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In a way, I can understand
other people's response

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:90%
to our work.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:10%
If someone had come up
and told me four years ago

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:10%
the kinds of things
I'm now telling people,

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:10%
I think I would have
been skeptical also.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:84%
When I first met Ingo, of
course he was coming out

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
with this claim of quote, "being
a psychic" and at that time,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
before I started seeing results
of it, I was very skeptical.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And he was very confident.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.315 align:middle line:84%
>> The psychic is a kind
of remote sensing device,

00:20:24.315 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and that I think has a
contribution to make to both

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:90%
science and humanity.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
To understand Ingo,
I think you have

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to see a creative, highly
intelligent, deeply wounded

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
man, who found in
remote viewing a pathway

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
to the acclaim that he sought.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:10%
>> We might do an experiment
that looked like a really good

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:10%
outcome, and he
would say no, no, no.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:10%
This is not so good.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:10%
And he would come up
with some loophole.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:10%
And so he would say look, if we
take credit for an experiment,

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:10%
and then someone
can come along later

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.890 align:middle line:10%
and find some loophole
or some false positive,

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:10%
then they'll reject it.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And then even when we do good
experiments, they'll reject it.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> He told me a story.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
He was a homosexual, which
doesn't matter, I mean,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
who cares?

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But it mattered
to him, because he

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
told me a story which I've never
forgotten of being beaten up

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
by a bunch of boys who
he liked and admired

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:90%
when he was a youth.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think he wanted
to be acknowledged.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I've often recovered many of
the thoughts about existence I

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:90%
had as a child.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:10%
A major one of these was the
separation of consciousness

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:10%
from the body, which was
very real when I was a child.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
This kind of thing
happens in art.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:10%
I believe, and I
always have believed,

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:10%
and I've returned to it
many times in my life,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:10%
that I am not this body
in terms of consciousness,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness can go
places where the body cannot.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very important to
him to be validated by SRI.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
SRI was the first lab of a
different order of magnitude

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
from all prior
parapsychological research.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> What SRI was always upset
about is that during our day

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
here, we brought in 1% of the
money and 99% of the publicity.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in 1972, SRI was
primarily a contractor

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.705 align:middle line:84%
for the government
and some industry.

00:22:43.705 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.510 align:middle line:84%
With the riots in the
late '60s, early '70s,

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
the fact that classified
work was going on

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford University,
they didn't like that.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Up until that time, most
parapsychological research was

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
done by small foundations
on minuscule budgets,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
operating in a corner
of some basement.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:10%
>> At SRI, the level of
classification was top secret.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time to get
the security clearance.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't walk around.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to be escorted
because of the secret projects.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Full of high-class
scientific equipment,

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
beeping, and showing on
the cathode, ray tubes

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And when Russell and
Hal got positioned there,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.785 align:middle line:90%
it had a big impact.

00:23:40.785 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And on Ingo, it had a
particularly big impact,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
because the work that he did
at SRI drew a lot of attention.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> To be in that
kind of laboratory,

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
they must be very important
and really have a grasp

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:90%
of the truth.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So you guys had a psychological
procedure in the neighborhood

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
thing, as it were,
that was fantastic,

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's partially why
you got such damn good results.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.905 align:middle line:84%
>> And all of them
succeeded in remote viewing.

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Doctors Puthoff and
Targ do not know how.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And so maybe one of the
most important things

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:10%
about the work done
here is that it

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:10%
has been published
in one of the most

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.340 align:middle line:10%
conservative and prestigious
scientific journals

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:10%
in the world with this note.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:10%
"Few readers will finish without
wondering for at least a moment

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:10%
if indeed ESP might
be possible after all.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.934 align:middle line:84%
What a difference that
would make to us all."

00:24:38.934 --> 00:24:43.516 align:middle line:84%
Jack Perkins, NBC News, Stanford
Research Institute, California.

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Ingo was really the father
of remote viewing in the modern

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:90%
era.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Before Ingo, people
were describing

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:90%
the picture in the envelope.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Square.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Good guess, but wrong.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.873 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, if I want to
see what's in the envelope,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll open the envelope.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I can focus my attention
anywhere on the planet.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Give me something
interesting to look at.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> And he threatened to quit.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we asked him,
well, what do you mean?

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:10%
What would you like to do?

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And he says, just
send somebody out

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.325 align:middle line:10%
in the San Francisco
Bay area, and I'll

00:25:24.325 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:10%
describe where they are.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it takes a lot of
guts to accept a challenge like

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
The psychics involved
could sort of

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
get into it at a creative
level and discover

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
things very distant
from themselves

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and then go find out if
they were really there.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we had, by now, 30
analysts, not scientists,

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
in CIA, and maybe six or seven
scientists in CIA talking about

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:84%
these initial dozen or so
results of these anecdotal

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:10%
>> We began by speaking of some
kind of a, almost a psychic arm

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:10%
is raised here.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:10%
Is there any real
application to this?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time, there
were rumors, certainly,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.958 align:middle line:84%
that the government
was doing something,

00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:84%
but nobody actually
knew what was going on.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Why are the intelligence
communities chasing after this

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:10%
thing called remote viewing?

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:10%
What if there are no secrets?

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on here?

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> They had to put resources on
something that sounded crazy.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And we would all talk
about them and say, well, I

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:90%
know I didn't lie.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I know you didn't lie.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And we'd get polygraphed
once in a while.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear
we weren't lying.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.326 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the issue.

00:27:06.326 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's going on?

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> These people from
CIA were very concerned.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
They had one goal in mind, to
prove that it was nonsense.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've looked
into your background.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
You've had these high
security clearances.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:90%
You've been polygraphed.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:90%
We know we can trust you.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have
been spending millions

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:84%
of dollars over a decade at
some of their best institutes

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:90%
investigating so-called ESP.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
No scientists in
America even believe

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:90%
there is such a thing as ESP.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was because the
Soviets had a completely

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:90%
materialistic viewpoint.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Even in Lenin's writings, he
said since consciousness isn't

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:84%
observable, it must be physical,
and therefore, physical things

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:90%
must have consciousness.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And so he thought even atoms
had some level of consciousness.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.082 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the
question becomes,

00:27:59.082 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
how close does it have
to be for you to see it?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it in this room?

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:90%
In the next?

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
How about-- can you see
on the other side of town?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The question began to start
to formulate about distance.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe, like everything
else that we know physically,

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.347 align:middle line:10%
it's quantum mechanical.

00:28:13.347 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:10%
That means it's
spread out everywhere.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not in spacetime anymore.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So exactly the
same way that I can

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:84%
focus on my name
being spoken, there's

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
something about
attention that I can

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.525 align:middle line:84%
use in order to narrow in and
pay attention to something.

00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to pay
attention to what's

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:84%
happening on Pluto
a million years ago,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:90%
I should be able to do that.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.012 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what
the remote viewers do.

00:28:35.012 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Ingo Swann was
looking at Jupiter nine months

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
before Voyager got there,
and correctly described rings

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
that no astronomer had ever
seen or even suspected.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:90%
So how did he do that?

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it suggests that the
rings of Jupiter was in his head

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
This becomes a very
materialistic way

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about what's
going on, but who cares?

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.217 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm interested
in what the truth is.

00:28:56.217 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't know how
to evaluate this.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if it's
a threat or what.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say the difference
between the American scientific

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:10%
community and the Soviet is
that at the highest levels

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:10%
in the Soviet
scientific community,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:10%
psychic research is taken
seriously and there's no doubt

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.270 align:middle line:10%
about it.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:10%
>> And you're claiming in
this country, it is not?

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say in
this country it's not,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because people are worried about
the so-called giggle potential.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Our normal socialization,
being a psychologist now,

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:84%
is that stuff like
ESP is nonsense.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.223 align:middle line:90%
It can't happen.

00:29:27.223 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody
tells you to do it,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:90%
they're asking something stupid.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And they banged a
telephone book size thing down

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:90%
at the table.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Paraphysics R&D Warsaw Pact
from the Defense Intelligence

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:84%
When I thumbed through
that, and saw all the work

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.905 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:29:44.905 --> 00:29:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It said the CIA was
tracking all of these people.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:90%
In this case, it was DIA.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is the report that I
finally wrote that summarized

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
everything we could
find at that time,

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was called Key
Intelligence Question number 9.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I labeled it
paraphysics, because I

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:84%
had to find a word that allowed
us at the Foreign Technology

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Division to sense that there
is a legitimate physics

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:90%
connection here.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's just randomly,
like a government support

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:90%
for parapsychics research.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Paraphysics.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Paraphysics.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Paraphysics.

00:30:21.395 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Returning with stories
of official government

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:90%
support for such research.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, such support seems
unquestioned by anyone.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:84%
All of the Soviet centers, of
course, are government-funded.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:90%
1971.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So especially over
there, since everything

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
was government-funded, you
had to take it more seriously.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In principle, this document
forms more policy than anything

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
else that goes on in the
intelligence community.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Why should the intelligence
community be interested in it?

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.463 align:middle line:84%
To access information,
in a generic sense.

00:30:51.463 --> 00:30:52.880 align:middle line:84%
You can use it for
communications,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.835 align:middle line:84%
like through remote
places, submarines,

00:30:54.835 --> 00:30:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and that came up later.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.798 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know, they'd
laugh me out of the room.

00:30:58.798 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was their
reaction when you said that?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Positive.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:90%
It was positive.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.475 align:middle line:90%
>> You got a positive reaction?

00:31:03.475 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They said, hey,
this is good stuff.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.143 align:middle line:90%
Follow it.

00:31:08.143 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When he wrote
his first report,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Dale Graff had no idea
what he was getting Defense

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence into.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Despite a series of remote
viewing experiments that

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:84%
beat the odds at over
1 million to one,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:90%
the CIA was still skeptical.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The Army, CIA, DIA, they
all had remote viewing programs

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.085 align:middle line:84%
eventually, but it all
began with the NSA break-in.

00:31:30.085 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The real operational
work began not with the bang

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.880 align:middle line:84%
of bullets and bombs,
but with a whisper.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sorry, actually
I misdirected you.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.820 align:middle line:90%
You were on the right--

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:90%
no, no, we should be up there.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>> About two psychics and two
laser physicists that broke

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.757 align:middle line:84%
into the most secret NSA
site that ever existed.

00:31:51.757 --> 00:31:53.340 align:middle line:84%
It was a whisper
that would eventually

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:90%
be heard around the world.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:90%
The CIA had a new secret weapon.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a hiatus, and
then Sugar Grove came along,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and somebody says this
cockamamie thing, well,

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:84%
now what we're doing is
we're doing a remote viewing

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:90%
by coordinates.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And I say what?

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It was code named SCANATE.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The SCANATE program
was started by Ingo Swann.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:10%
And in that program
we were using

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:10%
coordinate remote viewing.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:10%
A viewer described
what was located

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:10%
at any geographical coordinate
of latitude and longitude

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:10%
and would then
describe what's there.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And they tell
me what this is.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I say something
like, well, you're

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
prove that to me.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And the door opened at
the end of the hallway,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.100 align:middle line:90%
and a guy walks out.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me
some coordinates?

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Just map coordinates of
a place that you know.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.360 align:middle line:90%
He says, this will do it.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:84%
He says I'm positive
you don't know anything

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:90%
about what's there.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I said perfect,
perfect, perfect.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I took him.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Kit gave Hal those
coordinates that nobody knew

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> From Ingo's standpoint,
he said this is really a sexy

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:90%
target.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.280 align:middle line:90%
It's got all kinds of antennas.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Seems like a very hush-hush
place, very military.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:10%
And he drew how
things were laid out.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The results came back so
specific on paper that I was

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:10%
just, like, I was
kind of nonplussed.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:10%
It included the diagram, the
guardhouse, accordion doors

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.840 align:middle line:10%
that roll up big enough
to put a Jeep through.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Four stories below,
hallway, cipher lock,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and I took it to my
colleague Dave, who

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:84%
would give me the
coordinates, and I said, here.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:90%


00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
He said man, Green,
this is nonsense.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I said, are you
really, really sure?

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, man, I gave you
the coordinates of the log cabin

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I just built in West Virginia.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:18.239 align:middle line:10%
So I called up my colleagues,
and I gave them the results.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sick of it.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:26.880 align:middle line:10%
And just before I hung up,
a fellow I was talking to,

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:10%
who I can't name, but whose
initials were Russ Targ,

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:36.660 align:middle line:10%
said that's really too bad.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:10%
It's really too bad.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:10%
Really too bad.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:10%


00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:10%
The other guy found
the same thing.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Early in the SRI program,
there had been some publicity,

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and Pat Price had read about it.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:84%
That happened to
be right when we

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.139 align:middle line:84%
had been asked to target
the West Virginia site.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was over the
telephone, saying, you know,

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a
police commissioner

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that in Burbank,

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I would
get intuitive flashes

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:84%
about some crime scene
that we were working on,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.448 align:middle line:84%
and it would turn
out I would be right.

00:35:11.448 --> 00:35:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should be a subject.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SRI comes up with Pat Price.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:84%
He had a map over his desk,
and he had a bunch of pins

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:84%
on the map of the
world, and the pins

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:90%
were all stuck in the ocean.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I said,
Pat, what are all those pins?

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.140 align:middle line:90%
They're scattered all around.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, I'm following
all the nuclear submarines

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and I move pins
around, and I relocate them.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
For an intelligence
officer, I mean,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.900 align:middle line:84%
this would be one of the most
fundamental breakthroughs

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
in Naval intelligence if you
could follow all the submarines

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Pat Price was brought in
independently to describe

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:10%
the same target location and
went on to read documents

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:00.872 align:middle line:10%
hidden in the vault three
floors below the surface.

00:36:00.872 --> 00:36:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that's
really interesting.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, OK, talk, talk,
talk, what did you say?

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I drove to the coordinates,
and I found the cabin.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And 100 meters down the
road, I found a dirt road

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:90%
from the cabin.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I drove down it.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Found the guardhouse, found the
dish, found the accordion door.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:10%
>> This Naval installation's
purpose is to perform

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.250 align:middle line:10%
communications research and
development for the US Navy,

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:10%
the Department of Defense,
and various elements of the US

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.182 align:middle line:10%
government.

00:36:39.182 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I reported that.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It got to the Office of
Research and Development,

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:90%
and it got to the office of OTS.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
huge controversy.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.807 align:middle line:84%
And it started as
very small ball.

00:36:57.807 --> 00:36:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But what the person
who picked the target

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.955 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize was just
right over the ridge,

00:37:02.955 --> 00:37:05.482 align:middle line:84%
a mile or so away,
whatever it was,

00:37:05.482 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
was this super secret facility
for picking up Russian

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:84%
satellite information
as it went overhead.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And so both of them
said, ah, maybe that's

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:90%
what they want us to describe.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1960s, Sugar Grove
became one of the NSA's most

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.945 align:middle line:10%
important Cold War
listening facilities.

00:37:29.945 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole
thing blew up.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But remember, it was about
what was inside that building.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:84%
File folders with
the following names.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:10%
I remember that they were all
associated with a pool game,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.770 align:middle line:10%
like playing pool or billiards.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Filing cabinet on the north
wall labeled Operation Pool

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Cue.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Four ball, eight ball, rack up.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying, you know, this
is reminiscent of a visit

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:10%
to the place that Kit took him.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Within 24, 48 hours, I had
security officers in my office

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:27.657 align:middle line:10%
at headquarters, and they were
grim-faced and they were upset.

00:38:27.657 --> 00:38:28.490 align:middle line:90%
They had been told--

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I was told this officially,
it's been made public.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:90%
The filing cabinets were there.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.710 align:middle line:90%
They were green.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.060 align:middle line:90%
There were file folders.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And they had the exact three
names on the file folders.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was the first
thing that was important,

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:90%
is that they were correct.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
However those guys out in
California got the code names,

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:84%
they got code names that
were part of a special access

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Not just code names, they got
special access program code

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
names, which were
classified top secret.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Their names were
classified top secret.

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.315 align:middle line:84%
>> We were then descended upon
by all the law enforcement

00:39:14.315 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>> We had government agencies
from NSA and CIA coming

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:10%
to visit us and find out why
the CIA had targeted a group

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:30.950 align:middle line:10%
of psychics to go
spying on the NSA.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:34.950 align:middle line:10%
>> So I didn't know whether to
be sick to my stomach or what

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:10%
to do.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So it wasn't just Kit Green,
it was the owners of the site.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know some
of it, like some

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.270 align:middle line:84%
of the names that I told you,
turned out to be accurate.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
concern, a security leak.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.498 align:middle line:84%
Somebody has let
this information out.

00:39:53.498 --> 00:39:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If I was Director
of Intelligence,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:84%
or even the President, and I was
briefed on what you just told

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:84%
me about those code words,
I would think that this was

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
either a propaganda thing, or I
would think that there's a guy

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:84%
who could probably look inside
a nuclear missile silo and give

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:90%
me the launch codes.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And that guy is really important
and potentially dangerous.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's either a
hoax, or it's real.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Now if, you're asking me where
I sit, it's in the latter.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, what
really is going on here?

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Do we have a
counterintelligence issue,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
where people can do this
sort of stuff against us?

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course the
other side is hey,

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:84%
can we do it against
somebody else?

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:10%
>> How would it be if we spent
half of our time on operational

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.373 align:middle line:10%
targets for the CIA, and half
of our time doing research?

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.290 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I understand
what you want to do.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:10%
That would be fair.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Everybody knew that there
had to be some foundational

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:10%
science, or this stuff
would never be accepted.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Stanford Research
Institute has been conducting

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
an experimental program in
the field of psychoenergetic

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I had Hal and Russ
bring Uri Geller to me,

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
who was supposedly one of the
psychokinetic people who could

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:84%
take and bend spoons and do
other magic kind of things with

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:90%
materials.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And we had an experiment set up.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>> 15 drawings were placed
in double-sealed envelopes

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
in a safe for which none
of the experimenters had

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:90%
the combination.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.870 align:middle line:84%
This is Geller's representation
of what he believed

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:90%
was sealed in the envelope.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the most off-target
of the drawings that he did.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.650 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, he is
quite elated about getting

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:90%
the right answer.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, this is real.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Don't you try to debunk this
, because it is scientifically

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.830 align:middle line:90%
proven.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can tell you the Agency
did a little background check

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:84%
on Uri and found out that he
might be working for some other

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.430 align:middle line:90%
government, shall we say.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:90%
And so he was just dropped.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:90%
There were security concerns.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The worry was that there was
national security information

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.310 align:middle line:90%
that could be gathered.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What he said was that he
mushed his head into a safe,

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and these words
popped into his mind.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:32.030 align:middle line:84%
When a CIA analyst reads
this and says, what?

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean if I have
a document on my desk,

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that I consider highly sensitive
and classified, that there

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
could be some Russian psychic
1,000 miles away reproducing

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:90%
what I'm looking at?

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Suddenly, the lights came on,
and we had CIA money and fresh

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:10%
support for our research.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Our CIA handlers warned us
to be wary of bugs, phone

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.720 align:middle line:90%
taps, and even honey pots.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:10%
We could see anywhere, and
they had unlimited resources

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:10%
to back up our claims.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:84%
We even had a degree of fame
among those in the know.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.280 align:middle line:90%
It was like a dream come true.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:28.270 align:middle line:90%


00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> With new funding and
assignments from the CIA,

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:84%
it seemed as if Hal and
Russell could do no wrong.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of place do
you experience them at?

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Attorney General from
somewhere in northern

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.010 align:middle line:84%
California came to us and said,
would you help us with this

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:47.100 align:middle line:90%
case?

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:90%
She's been kidnapped.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The heiress had been
kidnapped from her Berkeley

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.730 align:middle line:90%
apartment.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.460 align:middle line:84%
As we walked in, the police were
very excited, and they said,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of questions
we want to ask you.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And Price said, let me
show you how we do this.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Let me see a mug book.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And he put his finger on
Donald DeFreeze and said,

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.220 align:middle line:90%
that's the ringleader.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The Berkeley police
said, we know who he is.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:84%
He walked away from a minimum
security prison a year ago.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said, you know, this
is not your regular kidnapping

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:90%
for money.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.700 align:middle line:84%
This is some kind
of political thing.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And then she's photographed
robbing banks alongside the--

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:10%
you know, with an AK-47
or something like that,

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.670 align:middle line:10%
with the other crooks.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I get this image
of crosshairs.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Looking at crosshairs.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We're getting closer.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.450 align:middle line:90%
It's more like an intersection.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:84%
He told us where the car that
they had kidnapped her in

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.100 align:middle line:90%
had been left.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Across the freeway are two
large white gas storage tanks,

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and one of the detectives said,
well, I know where that is.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So the policemen ran out,
and they actually found the car

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.260 align:middle line:90%
where he said.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And we went to a shack they
thought might be a hideout.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience of
the detective handing

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:08.210 align:middle line:84%
me his sidearm, and said, you
know how to fire a pistol?

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I happen
to own an automatic.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes I do.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't realize he'd be
handing Mr. Magoo an automatic

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.455 align:middle line:90%
so that I could cover his back.

00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What a handsome
walking stick.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> This was an assignment
outside my job description.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful continental flavor.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We were basically
detectives on the case.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:84%
On the street, boots on
the ground, so to speak.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Problem was that the Berkeley
police did not cooperate with

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the Alameda Sheriff's
department, the county Sheriff,

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and neither of them were
cooperating with the FBI.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It was only after the entire
thing was resolved we found out

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that that indeed was the area
where she was being kept,

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and the layout in the
apartment was as he described.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, she was
being kept in a closet.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And we got a formal
commendation from the Berkeley

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:90%
police department.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a lot of people
got killed in the meantime.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.727 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.727 --> 00:46:09.380 align:middle line:10%
>> They attracted not only
fans in law enforcement.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The CIA had gotten hold
of Soviet documents in which

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:20.430 align:middle line:84%
our names were in there as
targets to betray and to be

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.610 align:middle line:90%
turned if possible.

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So we said, well, then we have
to take this whole thing very

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.320 align:middle line:90%
seriously.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And I began to
feel frightened.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:32.415 align:middle line:84%
It felt like penetrating
into a dangerous area.

00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:35.895 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.895 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When he died, he was out
in Las Vegas. (ECHOING) Died,

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.710 align:middle line:90%
he was out in Las Vegas.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Medical circumstances
would admit to a coronary,

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and would admit to what
he said he suffered from,

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:90%
which was poisoning.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, he
said food poisoning.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Later on,
somebody said, well,

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.390 align:middle line:90%
you know the KGB did him in.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh yeah, I hear
these rumors I have no reason

00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:90%
to believe that.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> This appears to be a
state-sponsored assassination

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:90%
attempt.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Statement of the Prime Minister.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:10%
>> But now, eight days
on, Theresa May came

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.860 align:middle line:10%
to the Commons.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:10%
In her hands, one of the
most remarkable statements

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.450 align:middle line:10%
she's delivered
as Prime Minister.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It is now clear that Mr.
Skripal and his daughter were

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.830 align:middle line:10%
poisoned with a military grade
nerve agent of a type developed

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:10%
by Russia.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.840 align:middle line:84%
This is part of a group of
nerve agents known as Novichok.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.146 align:middle line:84%
>> It causes suffocation
and heart failure.

00:47:31.146 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I said, what do you mean?

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, there was
a TV program or something,

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean this was a decade later,
where they were interviewing

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:84%
an ex-KGB agent who had been
involved with an assassination

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.390 align:middle line:90%
squad.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And the interviewer had asked
him, you know, what do you do?

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.920 align:middle line:84%
How do you carry
out assassinations?

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.420 align:middle line:84%
If we had somebody
who was a target,

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.960 align:middle line:84%
we'd find out what their
medical profile was,

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and then we would
do something that

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:84%
would cause that medical
condition to go south quickly.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
just be assumed

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.200 align:middle line:84%
there was a medical
event, and that way we

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.080 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be found out.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.220 align:middle line:90%
And so the interviewer--

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.427 align:middle line:84%
I'm told, I haven't
seen this program yet.

00:48:16.427 --> 00:48:17.760 align:middle line:10%
I haven't been able to find it--

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.960 align:middle line:10%
the interviewer said,
well, did you ever

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.895 align:middle line:10%
actually use that approach?

00:48:23.895 --> 00:48:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah, once on a
psychic who worked for the CIA.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Arrived at the scene.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Our husbands and wives.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.110 align:middle line:90%


00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.930 align:middle line:10%
>> They really do, for instance,
have a Soviet experiment

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:10%
in remote strangulation.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Larissa Vilenskaya was put in
charge of monitoring SRI's ESP

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:48.030 align:middle line:90%
work from Moscow.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Karmensky was in Moscow,
and Nikolai was in Leningrad.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:10%
Karmensky imagined that he
tried to strangle Nikolai.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Nikolai was on
the way to, and he

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:90%
felt that he couldn't breathe.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:84%
He was on the edge
of unconscious state,

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly
everything disappeared

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:84%
just because Karmensky in Moscow
stopped transmit this image.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Do solemnly swear

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm well to the
best of my ability

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>> To preserve,

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Protect,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And defend the Constitution

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the United States,

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>> So help me God.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I got frustrated as I
realized I may be trapped

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.760 align:middle line:90%
in our own success.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Everything was now a secret.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even tell my family.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Our phones might be tapped.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Only thing secret
about this program--

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.050 align:middle line:10%
what is it with
the secret program?

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But we weren't
publishing anything.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.280 align:middle line:10%
We went to the CIA
handlers and said, look,

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.620 align:middle line:10%
you've got to let us publish
some of these experiments.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Everyone's beginning to
say well, gee, maybe it's

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:55.330 align:middle line:10%
a secret program.

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.440 align:middle line:10%
So we got their
permission to put together

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:10%
a series of our Bay Area
remote viewing experiments

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.290 align:middle line:10%
and publish it.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> They wouldn't let us
publish the hot stuff,

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't care about
the bigger implications

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:11.490 align:middle line:90%
of our work.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I had made a
deal with the devil.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I said, have him go
back and get some more.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the obvious thing
was to do something

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.430 align:middle line:90%
on the operational side.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:10%
So I started searching
around for a project that

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:10%
would have some impact.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.590 align:middle line:90%
It was a research facility.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.510 align:middle line:84%
That was all that we
were going to tell them.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was our very first,
number one, Soviet site.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Pat Price was the remote
viewer in this case.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.840 align:middle line:84%
The CIA people came and just
gave us coordinates and said,

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:90%
look here.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And so he leans
back in his chair,

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:59.280 align:middle line:84%
puts his glasses on, and I'm
looking at him and I'm saying

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to myself, why does
he put his glasses?

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, I put my
glasses on because I

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:84%
can see better remotely
when I have my glasses on.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
thinking, yeah, OK.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We sat down with our coffee,
and I said here is the target,

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Pat.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:15.100 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Next morning, they
came back with a sketch.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And we showed
him the picture.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So I go over and I say, well,
I've got this science fiction

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.930 align:middle line:90%
fantasy crane.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we looked at
that and, you know,

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:35.940 align:middle line:84%
were quite frankly astounded
at the similarities.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And he unrolled a big
picture of an R&D facility,

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.090 align:middle line:10%
and right in the middle of
this facility was a photograph

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.250 align:middle line:10%
of a giant gantry crane.

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:51.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So the sketch on the
left is what Price produced.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:10%
And this one is the one that is
derived from the photographic--

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.290 align:middle line:10%
or from the sketch from
the photographic image.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:10%
He said, oh, this
was a huge crane.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.470 align:middle line:10%
He said, I saw
somebody walk by it,

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:08.210 align:middle line:10%
and the guy only came up
to the axle or something,

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.570 align:middle line:10%
on the wheels, or up to
the top of the wheels.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.598 align:middle line:84%
Pat, what do you see
about underground?

00:52:13.598 --> 00:52:15.890 align:middle line:10%
>> He said, one of the big
things they're doing here is

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:10%
making these 60 foot
spheres out of steel.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.430 align:middle line:90%
They're actually 58 feet.

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What I was told was the
analysts of Semipalatinsk did

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.710 align:middle line:90%
not know about the gores.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.760 align:middle line:10%
>> They finally rolled out a
60-foot diameter steel sphere

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.090 align:middle line:10%
that was part of a containment
vessel for a particle beam

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:42.920 align:middle line:10%
weapon to shoot down American
surveillance satellites.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.690 align:middle line:10%
Exactly what Price described.

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The end game is this
big review occurs of all

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:05.300 align:middle line:84%
operations-oriented testing from
a contractor like SRI should

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.750 align:middle line:90%
stop.

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
CIA's decision

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:84%
was because of
security concerns.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:15.150 align:middle line:84%
They were going to cut out SRI
and work with Pat directly,

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:90%
so they did so.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The CIA moved Pat Price
to a farm on the outskirts

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:90%
of Washington.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:25.740 align:middle line:84%
He was doing day to
day spying for the CIA.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> We've broken into some
foreign embassies in foreign

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.870 align:middle line:90%
countries, and we bugged them.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.890 align:middle line:10%
And we have the
operational files.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is
we got Pat Price,

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and we brought one
of the people who

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:49.500 align:middle line:84%
had made this entry
into the room with Pat.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So we gave him a photograph of
the outside of the building,

00:53:55.950 --> 00:54:00.090 align:middle line:84%
but the goal of those
operational people

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:06.000 align:middle line:84%
was to find the code room of the
embassy and basically bug it.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So they needed to get in the
embassy, find it, place a bug,

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and get out before the guards
opened up the next morning.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.920 align:middle line:10%
He supposedly located
the physical place

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.450 align:middle line:10%
in the embassy that
was the code room area.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So according to the operations
guy, yeah, he found the place,

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and they should use him again.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.765 align:middle line:90%
He was inside the code room.

00:54:33.765 --> 00:54:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Sonning Court.

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Turn up the street.

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.550 align:middle line:90%
So the Wizard of Sonning Court.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.322 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.322 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Just dropping off Russell.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Come in.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:59.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Uri Geller knows a
lot about code rooms.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Uri says he spent a long
time working facade,

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:84%
so perhaps he knows what
happened to Pat Price as well.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can tell me,
what was the meeting about?

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.700 align:middle line:84%
What were you doing in the
secret room in the capitol?

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.733 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, there actually--

00:55:13.733 --> 00:55:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You must have been
briefing somebody.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Actually, there were 10 there.

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:19.490 align:middle line:84%
There are probably two
or three shielded rooms

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:21.700 align:middle line:84%
at different levels,
but it's actually

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.270 align:middle line:84%
in the capitol dome,
the shielded room.

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:29.740 align:middle line:84%
It is a room where no
eavesdropping can take place,

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because the walls are leaded, et
cetera, all kinds of materials.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Even the plugs are different.

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And it can also
be a wine cellar,

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:46.165 align:middle line:84%
so while doing secret work, you
can drink wine and get drunk.

00:55:46.165 --> 00:55:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, well, I wanted to--

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.775 align:middle line:84%
a shielded room with a
perfect conversation.

00:55:49.775 --> 00:55:50.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:50.575 --> 00:55:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to talk to you
about the death of Pat Price.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:01.170 align:middle line:10%
>> And Pat comes in with his
description of an underwater

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:05.400 align:middle line:10%
sabotage training facility
several kilometers away from

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.200 align:middle line:10%
the sea coast.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And this information was
passed on to the Libyan desk.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.100 align:middle line:84%
They saw a facility,
basically, where he said,

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that they hadn't seen before,
and a few days later Pat Price

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.580 align:middle line:90%
died.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.080 align:middle line:90%
This was the end of Pat Price.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> CIA hired Price away from us,
and four months after joining

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:33.200 align:middle line:90%
the CIA, Price was dead.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And the big question
is was he killed,

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:90%
or was it a natural death?

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Like in the movies.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
You want to know, did he
jump, or was he pushed?

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:41.841 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think?

00:56:41.841 --> 00:56:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The emergency department
people said that there was

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:54.160 align:middle line:84%
an individual that came in
with him with a briefcase that

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.640 align:middle line:84%
showed the attending physician
in the emergency room his

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.440 align:middle line:84%
recent EKGs from Greenbrier,
which was the facility that I

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.400 align:middle line:84%
knew that we'd taken him to to
get his cardiological workup

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.270 align:middle line:90%
some months ago.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And basically
said, look, the guy

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.113 align:middle line:84%
had rampant serious
coronary artery disease.

00:57:12.113 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:90%
He had a heart attack.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:18.280 align:middle line:10%
So even though he died
unattended in a hotel room,

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:23.050 align:middle line:10%
they decided, they meaning
the hospital and the police,

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:26.050 align:middle line:10%
to not make it a
medical examiner case.

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't do an autopsy,
although that's not correct,

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and the man disappeared with
the briefcase with the notes.

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.860 align:middle line:84%
They never took
any records of it.

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Body was removed and cremated.

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And then they called his wife.

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wow.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:51.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Price was known to
have a heart condition,

00:57:51.365 --> 00:57:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and he may have
had a heart attack.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Next.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The Russians may
have killed him.

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And deferred.

00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> My opinion is the CIA
discovered quickly they had

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:05.220 align:middle line:90%
a terrible problem.

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> After Price's death, it
emerged that his church may

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.800 align:middle line:84%
have been attempting to
blackmail the IRS using

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.770 align:middle line:90%
classified documents.

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a file cabinet
that's got a folder full of this

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.980 align:middle line:84%
stuff, and this church had a
problem with the government.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.700 align:middle line:84%
He would go back to
his church officials

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and immediately give
them a debriefing

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of everything that he said
and everything that I said.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Here the guy who was walking
on water was a traitor.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I do not think he was
a spy for his church.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I was
shocked and devastated,

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.890 align:middle line:84%
because I had no
idea about this.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If he walks into the
president's office and reads

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.520 align:middle line:84%
a nuclear code, if it turns
out that Superman is a double

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.750 align:middle line:90%
agent, what do you do?

00:58:53.750 --> 00:59:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If he didn't understand and
misinterpreted what it was that

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:06.580 align:middle line:84%
he could tell his confessor in
his church, I forgive him that.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not Pat's fault.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing intelligence,
knowing what's happening around

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:19.610 align:middle line:84%
the world, and having
worked for certain agencies,

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:21.435 align:middle line:84%
I know a little more
about this story.

00:59:21.435 --> 00:59:23.352 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly why I
wanted to talk to you.

00:59:23.352 --> 00:59:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And people who are so
valuable are never taken out.

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:33.920 align:middle line:84%
They tempt them with
amazing circumstantial--

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:41.030 align:middle line:84%
moneys, dwellings,
houses, to work for them.

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:42.420 align:middle line:90%
They would never.

00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:47.160 align:middle line:84%
This is like killing the
goose that lays golden eggs.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Devices which would have
enabled the CIA to use this

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:54.390 align:middle line:10%
poison for killing people.

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:58.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Does this pistol
fire the dart?

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes it does, mister chairman,
and a special one was developed

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:06.210 align:middle line:10%
which potentially would be able
to enter the target without

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:09.330 align:middle line:10%
perception.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the CIA had a heart
attack gun that was revealed.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now, the CIA is not in
the business of killing people.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:25.980 align:middle line:90%


01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they were in the
business of making a very

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.890 align:middle line:90%
complicated killing machine.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:32.685 align:middle line:84%
And they got a lot
of trouble for that.

01:00:32.685 --> 01:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I saw Pat shortly
before he was killed.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
He was coming to see us.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But before he left, he called
several of his friends to say

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
goodbye in an odd way.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So in short, he
predicted his own death.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And he purchased a $1 million
term life insurance to give

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.368 align:middle line:90%
to his wife Ann at the airport.

01:00:53.368 --> 01:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> You see, I didn't know that.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

01:00:55.590 --> 01:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And he changed his trip to
visit his son in Salt Lake.

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe he had a psychic
feeling that he was about

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
to die.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
He must have been one of the
greatest psychics in the world.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Some Army remote
viewers tasked themselves

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
on Price's death years later
and decided he was still alive

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and at work.

01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:18.215 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this was
just speculation.

01:01:18.215 --> 01:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It was entirely unmarked.

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:21.900 align:middle line:90%
He deserved better than that.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:33.520 align:middle line:90%


01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Shortly after that, Hal and
I were called back to Washington

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.690 align:middle line:90%
for an investigation.

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What the CIA had hoped
to squash by eliminating

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
SRI's contract would only
grow after an "Aviation Week"

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
article released after Pat's
death perfectly matched his

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
description of the
gores of Semipalatinsk,

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
something no one else
in US intelligence knew.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
This shook the halls of power
and set into motion new fears

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.610 align:middle line:90%
about Russian psychic spies.

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The question is why?

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
What was happening in
July, August of last year?

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The House Committee on
Intelligence Oversight decided

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:13.830 align:middle line:10%
it must be a security leak that
gave the California psychics

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.950 align:middle line:10%
information that no one in
the rest of the intelligence

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:18.447 align:middle line:10%
community had.

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:21.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Well actually, I was excited
about the opportunity to brief

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.505 align:middle line:10%
them, because by this
point in our career,

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:26.400 align:middle line:10%
the more people at high levels
who knew about what we were

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.980 align:middle line:10%
doing, the more support
there was to make sure that

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.210 align:middle line:10%
the program moved forward.

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Unfortunately, you will
learn today that these efforts

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.110 align:middle line:10%
by Russia to discredit the US
and weaken the West are not

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:39.490 align:middle line:10%
new.

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:42.100 align:middle line:10%
>> All I can say is that
if the results were faked,

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.420 align:middle line:10%
our security system
doesn't work.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.730 align:middle line:10%
What these persons
saw was confirmed

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.620 align:middle line:10%
by aerial photography.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.290 align:middle line:10%
There's no way they
could have been faked.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:55.040 align:middle line:10%
>> There are four senators
out there fighting to keep it

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.050 align:middle line:10%
going.

01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:59.640 align:middle line:10%
>> What's next?

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.580 align:middle line:10%
Are we looking at
a new Iron Curtain

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.192 align:middle line:10%
descending across
Eastern Europe?

01:03:05.192 --> 01:03:07.025 align:middle line:10%
>> And we were supported
for another decade.

01:03:07.025 --> 01:03:21.340 align:middle line:90%


01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> One physicist said there was
no point in teaching physics

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because we'd learned
all there was to know.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we look back and realize
that what we thought we knew

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%
was the tiniest fragment.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the CIA publicly
denigrated the idea of remote

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
viewing and claimed to end
interest in the subject after

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
the death of Pat Price,
SRI's rising profile led

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
to partnerships with
every single branch

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
of the intelligence community.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Defense Intelligence Agency took
on a contract with the US Army

01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:56.260 align:middle line:90%
in 1978.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It begins.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.490 align:middle line:10%
But this being the Army, it
really starts with a drill,

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:01.300 align:middle line:10%
naturally.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Over 3,000 troops
in Fort Meade,

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.550 align:middle line:10%
Maryland were screened by Army
intelligence to find the top

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:09.310 align:middle line:10%
six that would
spearhead the program.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That first day
in the company.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> These were
grunts, regular guys,

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Vietnam vets picked because
they had a knack for avoiding

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:20.140 align:middle line:90%
landmines.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.190 align:middle line:90%
And the CIA didn't like it.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It caused leaks.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:29.020 align:middle line:10%
The most decorated
was remote viewer 001,

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Chief Warrant Officer
Joe McMoneagle.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The Stanford Art Museum was
Joe McMoneagle's first ever

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:38.860 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
We then did five
more trials with him.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Altogether, we did 36 trials
with the six Army volunteers.

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.640 align:middle line:10%
Out of the 36 trials,
these officers

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.930 align:middle line:10%
were able to get 19 first
place matches where one would

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:58.630 align:middle line:10%
expect only six by chance.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
The odds of such an excellent
result is better than one

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:03.960 align:middle line:90%
in a million.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe got the Legion of Merit.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That is a very big deal.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:11.410 align:middle line:10%
It is the second highest
non-combatant award

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:13.540 align:middle line:10%
that the military gives.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:19.360 align:middle line:10%
He has done more live
to tape remote viewings

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.280 align:middle line:10%
than anybody else alive.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> He lives at the top of the
mountain where every great

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.045 align:middle line:90%
prophet lives.

01:05:27.045 --> 01:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> He was the first to speak out
when parts of the program were

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
publicly outed in 1995 and
subsequently denigrated

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.190 align:middle line:90%
by the CIA.

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:38.720 align:middle line:10%
>> It may have helped locate
American hostages in Iran.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.030 align:middle line:10%
>> There were two or three
others that were hauled away

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.580 align:middle line:10%
from the embassy, and no one
seemed to know exactly where

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.310 align:middle line:10%
that was, but we were
instrumental in helping

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.020 align:middle line:10%
identify that location.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:53.940 align:middle line:10%
>> I was paid to do remote
viewing by the US Army for six

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.140 align:middle line:10%
straight years.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And indeed, he turned out
to be one of the most psychic

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
people we ever worked with.

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:02.400 align:middle line:10%
>> You can actually take out
of thin air information about

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.540 align:middle line:10%
something you have absolutely no
access to just using your mind.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing was first
brought to my attention

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:10.050 align:middle line:10%
by Skip Atwater.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:10.990 align:middle line:10%
>> It occurred to me.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:13.980 align:middle line:10%
I had been nine
or 10 years doing

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:17.370 align:middle line:10%
this counterintelligence work
when I said Colonel Webb,

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:19.800 align:middle line:10%
I brought this book
called "Mind Reach"

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.660 align:middle line:10%
and if what they say
in this book is true,

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.070 align:middle line:10%
there is a huge gap in our
counterintelligence effort

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.870 align:middle line:10%
here.

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I left the book "Mind
Reach" with him,

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and the next day I came in
and he says, you're right.

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, what's
being said in this book,

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
we aren't attending to.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
This might, in fact be a threat
to the intelligence community.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our greatest
operational successes was when

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Joe McMoneagle pinpointed and
described an enormous Russian

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
submarine in a location where
it was totally unexpected.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a very,
very large building.

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have enough
intelligence by ordinary means

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:10.130 align:middle line:84%
to know what is being
built inside that building.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The building was hundreds
of yards from the water.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
What I decided
through remote viewing

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
was that they were probably
constructing a new submarine,

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and the submarine was unique
in that it had twin hulls.

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The hulls were actually
stuck together this way,

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
so it was a twin-hulled,
very wide submarine.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.480 align:middle line:10%
It was half again larger than
any submarine in existence

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.740 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.490 align:middle line:10%
It had dozens of
new capabilities,

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.920 align:middle line:10%
and I said that they're
going to launch in 120 days.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And this was all disagreed
with by the senior officer

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.770 align:middle line:90%
from the CIA.

01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:53.720 align:middle line:84%
He made arrangements to look
at the area 114 days later,

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and they in fact had launched
the largest submarine

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.550 align:middle line:90%
ever built in history.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called the TK-089, the
Typhoon-class submarine.

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
The only response we
got from that individual

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.810 align:middle line:90%
was it was a lucky guess.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And that individual
is Robert Gates.

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you at any time
feel that this was worth

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.370 align:middle line:10%
the taxpayers' money?

01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, all I can say
is that in the 20 years,

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:23.705 align:middle line:10%
or 25 years that I was perhaps
in a position to be aware,

01:08:23.705 --> 01:08:27.830 align:middle line:10%
I don't know of a single
instance where it is documented

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:31.670 align:middle line:10%
that this kind of activity
contributed in any significant

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:36.260 align:middle line:10%
way to a policy decision or even
to informing policymakers about

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.359 align:middle line:10%
important information.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> In October 1983, Secretary
of Army John Marsh was briefed

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
by Lieutenant Colonel
Busby of INSCOM.

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.210 align:middle line:10%
His report stated that 350 of
700 remote viewing missions,

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:54.260 align:middle line:10%
or 50%, were deemed to
possess intelligence value,

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.819 align:middle line:10%
and 85% showed positive
evidence for remote viewing.

01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We probably collected
more intelligence on that one

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
submarine in four days than
the entire Soviet sub pack.

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
What you have to
understand is the program

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:14.149 align:middle line:84%
operated year-to-year
based on its successes, not

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.300 align:middle line:90%
its failures.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.529 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it was
funded on a year-to-year basis

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:23.609 align:middle line:84%
speaks loudly as to why
it existed for 20 years.

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And the chief proponent
in terms of tasking,

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
or the one agency that probably
used more remote viewing

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
than any other
agency, was the CIA.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm familiar with
that quote of Gates.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.340 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.819 align:middle line:84%
We closed the program because
it didn't amount to anything.

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Let me just read this
one thing I've got here.

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Joe got the Legion of Merit,
and Joe upon his retirement

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.290 align:middle line:90%
got this.

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:51.229 align:middle line:10%
"While with his command,
he used his talents

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:56.210 align:middle line:10%
and expertise in the execution
of more than 200 missions

01:09:56.210 --> 01:10:01.520 align:middle line:10%
addressing over 150 essential
elements of information.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.630 align:middle line:10%
These EEI," essential
elements of information,

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.920 align:middle line:10%
"contained critical
intelligence reported

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.640 align:middle line:10%
at the highest echelons of
our military and government,

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.780 align:middle line:10%
including such national
level agencies as the Joint

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:21.660 align:middle line:10%
Chiefs of Staff, DIA, NSA, CIA,
DEA, and the Secret Service,

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.680 align:middle line:10%
producing crucial and
vital intelligence

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.790 align:middle line:10%
unavailable from
any other source."

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.060 align:middle line:10%
That would tend to
suggest that Gates was not

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.530 align:middle line:10%
telling the truth.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:39.420 align:middle line:10%
>> We had the total support of
five administrations in a row.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Carter stood up and said,
we did this wonderful thing

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
when they found
the Tupolev bomber.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And the reporter said,
how did you find it?

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, we used our psychics.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%


01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We're on our way to see
President Carter and talk with

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
him about our mission to find a
downed Russian bomber in Zaire.

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.590 align:middle line:10%
We helped him pull the Soviet
bomber out of the jungle

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:11.260 align:middle line:10%
before the Soviets could find
it, thus revealing knowledge,

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.010 align:middle line:10%
as he did in his
recent autobiography.

01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> One time we had a small plane
go down somewhere in Africa,

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and we needed it very much to
find out where that plane had

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.470 align:middle line:90%
crashed.

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And we were not able to
find it by surveillance,

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:33.790 align:middle line:84%
so the director of the CIA heard
about a woman in California

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that was a medium or something,
I don't know the title for her,

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and she gave him the
latitude and longitude

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:45.010 align:middle line:90%
of the plane's whereabouts.

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We located the plane
where she said it was.

01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
time that I have ever

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
experienced something
that was inexplicable

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.347 align:middle line:90%
while I was President.

01:11:54.347 --> 01:11:58.258 align:middle line:90%


01:11:58.258 --> 01:12:00.050 align:middle line:10%
>> One evening, I'm
called into the office.

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.850 align:middle line:10%
I was working late.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:04.430 align:middle line:10%
And they said, we understand
that you have some people that

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:05.600 align:middle line:10%
can find things.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I said yeah, I have
the SRI contract.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.010 align:middle line:90%
There are people on staff there.

01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, this is
really a top secret burn

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:14.690 align:middle line:90%
before reading kind of project.

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture of an
airplane that's missing,

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and how can we get into
Africa and get to the airplane

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.520 align:middle line:90%
before the Soviets get there?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a defector.

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
He just took this airplane
south until he thought

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
it ran out of fuel
and punched out,

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and the airplane kept going.

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.675 align:middle line:90%
But it still had fuel.

01:12:34.675 --> 01:12:36.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
couldn't find it.

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't there.

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:38.085 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, it's
because you're

01:12:38.085 --> 01:12:39.650 align:middle line:90%
looking in the wrong place.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Look over here.

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Because by this time, the
entire intelligence community

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:47.890 align:middle line:90%
was involved.

01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:48.910 align:middle line:90%
She drew this.

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:51.565 align:middle line:84%
So I took the sketch,
this is the sketch,

01:12:51.565 --> 01:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and I handed it to
the search team.

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking
at this huge map,

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's 200 miles this
way, 200 miles down.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So she looks at that map,
and goes up to the map

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and said, over here.

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:07.000 align:middle line:10%
Here's where it is the X where
the pin went into the map.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They sent a helicopter out
to investigate the area.

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after
they landed, a native

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the jungle
carrying a piece of metal.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out it was
from the airplane that

01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
crashed and was within
about a mile of where it

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.020 align:middle line:90%
was, where the actual site was.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
All the information
was in the field

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
before the airplane
was found, and the CIA

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
did a special check
on that to make sure,

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and so did NSA, to make sure
that my story did hold water.

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The information was there
before we knew where it was.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The woman who
drew the sketch,

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.400 align:middle line:84%
referenced by Dale
and President Carter,

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
was an Air Force officer.

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:51.480 align:middle line:10%
She and an SRI
remote viewer, also

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.540 align:middle line:10%
crucial to the case's success,
have never come forward.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.260 align:middle line:90%


01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
The research out of SRI
showed that remote viewing had

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
no predictable
scientific limits,

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.230 align:middle line:90%
or even theories to explain it.

01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:08.172 align:middle line:84%
As the team racked up
success after success,

01:14:08.172 --> 01:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
higher and higher up
the chain of command

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.622 align:middle line:84%
the question was asked, how can
any of this even be possible?

01:14:14.622 --> 01:14:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I said, well, we've done
this remote viewing experiment,

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and the results are
very significant.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, one of
those guys is blind,

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and the other one's crazy.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The perfect team for
examining psychic abilities.

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I thought.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh boy.

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There's of course no way to
deal with people who don't want

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:35.720 align:middle line:90%
to know.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> A storm starts brewing, and
we get a new director of Office

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.230 align:middle line:90%
of Research and Development.

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:45.880 align:middle line:84%
He could not accept the
reality of paranormal activity.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
He said he knew that
this was not real.

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And a guy in the back
room jumped up and said,

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I know what this is.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is taking notes to
see which of us are gullible.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, whoever is
taking notes, I want

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you to know I'm not
buying any of this.

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%
And he marched out.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A week later, I came back
and I said, did you evaluate it?

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me what
you thought about it?

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, I
didn't evaluate it.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm not going to.

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> We're fundamentalists.

01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
There may be something to
it, but it may be demonic.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't want anything
to do with this.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You are working with
people who are in league with

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
the devil and you're part
of the Antichrist movement.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And I picked up the
data and walked out.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Deniers who think there is no
consciousness beyond our skulls

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
are a powerful force
in American society,

01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
are anti-science because they
do not respect or accept facts.

01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
They are people
whose worldview is

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
based on faith of a very
particular kind and belief

01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
in dogma.

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:07.866 align:middle line:90%


01:16:07.866 --> 01:16:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It is about dogma.

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.280 align:middle line:84%
From a religious standpoint,
all the way down.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, people that are
afraid of it, which is

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:19.490 align:middle line:10%
half the people on the planet.

01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:22.920 align:middle line:10%
It's so damaging.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I had a senior senator in
camera, in a meeting in camera,

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.280 align:middle line:10%
stand up and say you, sir, are
doing the work of the devil,

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.530 align:middle line:10%
and you will burn in
the fires of hell.

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And walk out.

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:39.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a senior lawmaker.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And then in the same meeting
when we broke for coffee, I

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
had another senior lawmaker
hug me and whisper in my ear,

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.250 align:middle line:90%
you're doing God's work, son.

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now which one scares
you the worst?

01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:54.860 align:middle line:90%


01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I think psi
research is important,

01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:02.810 align:middle line:10%
because it's an essential part
of reality which some science

01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:05.612 align:middle line:10%
hasn't yet taken note of.

01:17:05.612 --> 01:17:07.820 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, there's a lot
of misconception about it.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.630 align:middle line:10%
People just assuming
without any proof

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.980 align:middle line:10%
that there's no such thing.

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.000 align:middle line:10%
It's just a piece of dogma,
and science should not

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.620 align:middle line:10%
be about dogma.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.790 align:middle line:10%
>> How many people say they've
witnessed things that do not

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:25.820 align:middle line:10%
fit within a
materialistic paradigm,

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:29.120 align:middle line:10%
and then they're told you're
deluded because your experience

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.280 align:middle line:10%
doesn't conform to our dogma?

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
This is so fundamentally
anti-scientific it's

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
utterly appalling.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So once again this troubled
me, because I love science,

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and I respect this tremendous
evolution of science

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
for the last 400 years.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But when people speaking with
the authority of science say,

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
for example, that all
experiences can only be

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
functions of the brain, and if
you have any experiences that

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
cannot be explained within
a materialistic paradigm,

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you're deluded, then this
is dehumanizing, arrogant,

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
pompous, and close-minded, and
those terms should never come

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
in the same paragraph of
defining and explaining

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
science.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.040 align:middle line:10%
When the evidence just
gets to be overwhelming,

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.310 align:middle line:10%
and the groundswell
here is growing,

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:16.490 align:middle line:10%
I would say before
too long, if you still

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:19.100 align:middle line:10%
insist that the mind is nothing
more than an emergent property

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.830 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, it will
be widely recognized

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.450 align:middle line:10%
you are just ignorant.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:26.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And the key point about
physics is physics is always

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.320 align:middle line:10%
evolving.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Our knowledge of physics
is always expanding.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.330 align:middle line:10%
And phenomena which people
reject as impossible today

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:37.730 align:middle line:10%
may not be rejected as
impossible tomorrow,

01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:40.130 align:middle line:10%
because tomorrow we'll have
a more extensive theory

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:41.510 align:middle line:10%
of physics.

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Enter this next
wonderful reality,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and the most controversial
of the people.

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it shocked me that they
found anything to object to.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.330 align:middle line:90%
This is a hard core scientist.

01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm very happy to be here.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
My name is Russell Targ,
and I'm a physicist.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's my great
pleasure to tell you

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
about the remarkable work we did
at Stanford Research Institute

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:06.168 align:middle line:90%
investigating psychic ability.

01:19:06.168 --> 01:19:20.140 align:middle line:90%


01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:23.350 align:middle line:10%
I had a small
Wikipedia biographical

01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:26.560 align:middle line:10%
page that described that
I was born in Chicago,

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.700 align:middle line:10%
went to Columbia, and
worked with Hal Puthoff

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.440 align:middle line:10%
on the pseudoscience
called remote viewing.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So we had a chance for fish
and chips and a cup of tea.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.280 align:middle line:90%
We must be in England finally.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.165 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:19:41.165 --> 01:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a time
when I was ill,

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want my biography
to be that one-dimensional,

01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
so I wrote in that I had been
a pioneer in the development

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
of the laser and published
many, many papers in lasers.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Wikipedia masters kept
erasing all my laser paper.

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:04.210 align:middle line:84%
They said to me, people are not
interested in your laser work.

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
We just want to know about your
work with the pseudoscience.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
most of my life

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.130 align:middle line:90%
has been spent with lasers.

01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
allow me to do that.

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.480 align:middle line:10%
They banned me from Wikipedia.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And finally I got the help
of Brian Josephson, and only

01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
through Josephson's intercession
I got to bring my biography up

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
to speed.

01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:30.850 align:middle line:90%


01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that
consciousness is built

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:36.560 align:middle line:90%
into quantum theory?

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.680 align:middle line:10%
>> This of course is extremely
heretical, but fortunately,

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.970 align:middle line:10%
I've not only got
tenure, but I've retired,

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:49.720 align:middle line:10%
so I don't need to worry
about being a heretic.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.404 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not with you, exactly.

01:20:51.404 --> 01:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I saw it.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.210 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, are these
taking your picture?

01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:57.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.132 align:middle line:10%
>> You're being
interviewed, are you?

01:20:59.132 --> 01:21:00.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I was, yes.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:00.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Pardon?

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:01.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I was, yes.

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:02.780 align:middle line:10%
>> You were.

01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.580 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.860 align:middle line:10%
What's it to do with with?

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's really
about some research work.

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:11.690 align:middle line:10%
>> What?

01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:13.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Research work.

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:14.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Research.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You're able finally to
tell the complete truth.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:23.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Well actually, people
would probably not contemplate

01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:26.000 align:middle line:10%
getting rid of a
Nobel Prize winner,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.330 align:middle line:10%
so I more or less had
freedom in what I could do.

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:32.240 align:middle line:10%
Funding was a different matter.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.570 align:middle line:10%
They actually told
certain people,

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:38.880 align:middle line:10%
we'll fund you if you work with
anybody other than Josephson.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.757 align:middle line:10%
>> Stop!

01:21:39.757 --> 01:21:40.840 align:middle line:10%
Will you stop these fools?

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.455 align:middle line:10%
I'm not crazy.

01:21:42.455 --> 01:21:46.430 align:middle line:10%
Make them listen to me
before it's too late.

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> By and large, the critics
who've been interested enough

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
in our work to come
to our laboratory,

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
we have asked them to take part
in experiments and experience

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.375 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing themselves, which
is often very accurate indeed.

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:03.980 align:middle line:90%


01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest skeptics
was undersecretary of defense

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Walter LeBerge, who kept hearing
leaks about the mad scientist

01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:12.470 align:middle line:90%
of Menlo Park.

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to pay a visit
in his Air Force helicopter,

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.130 align:middle line:84%
landing on the SRI campus lawn
and causing quite the dust-up

01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:21.380 align:middle line:90%
to Hal and Russ's low profile.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Although he thought
it ridiculous,

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
LeBerge allowed himself
to become a subject,

01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and despite no prior
psychic experience,

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
he correctly and in great detail
imagined where his attaché was

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.580 align:middle line:90%
hiding.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
He then became one of the
team's biggest supporters,

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
along with other
senators, congressmen,

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and generals who
dropped in on the lab

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and got similar results.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It was becoming apparent that
this was a common ability,

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:46.745 align:middle line:84%
but how could they show
that when it was all secret?

01:22:46.745 --> 01:22:50.570 align:middle line:90%


01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Their first clue to how
common intuitive abilities are

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
came when a remote viewer
didn't show up for work.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had a chance to go
to San Jose, Costa Rica,

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
sort of a mountainous country.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And then each day,
a remote viewer

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
back in Menlo Park, California
described where I am.

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, on a particular day, I
had a chance to do a trick.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I got an airplane, I flew
out, and landed at an Island

01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:19.990 align:middle line:90%
that belonged to Colombia.

01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It also turned out on that
day the remote viewer didn't

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
show up, so Russell
decided, well,

01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll do the remote viewing.

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:31.143 align:middle line:84%
So Russell's trying
to suppress this data,

01:23:31.143 --> 01:23:32.310 align:middle line:90%
but it just keeps coming in.

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
He says, OK, well,
I guess I'm wrong.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you had no reason
to be in an airport.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I see ocean
at the end of the runway.

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know the ocean is miles
away in San Jose, Costa Rica.

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:45.648 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact,
that's exactly where

01:23:45.648 --> 01:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I was, because I had taken
this little side trip.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:49.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you actually
take that picture,

01:23:49.273 --> 01:23:51.350 align:middle line:90%
or is that a standard picture?

01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody else
took the picture who,

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
when we had this data, they went
out and took it from the same

01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:57.410 align:middle line:90%
angle.

01:23:57.410 --> 01:24:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Showing that even a scientist
can do good remote viewing.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> This led to a request from
their CIA handlers to bring

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.210 align:middle line:84%
in someone with absolutely
no psychic ability to get

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.580 align:middle line:90%
a baseline against their best.

01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:11.960 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work out so well.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
She was statistically the
best results they ever had,

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
even better than the
infamous Pat Price.

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.180 align:middle line:10%
>> We were asked to bring in
somebody who was willing to be

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.280 align:middle line:10%
a control person
for the program,

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.620 align:middle line:10%
and I chose to work
with Hella Hammid,

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.810 align:middle line:10%
who is an old friend
of the family.

01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
She promised me she had never
done ESP experiments before,

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and she would be very happy
to be part of our program.

01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:37.677 align:middle line:90%


01:24:37.677 --> 01:24:39.885 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a remote viewing
experiment with Russ Targ

01:24:39.885 --> 01:24:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and Hella Hammid.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Today is Friday
October 11, 1974.

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's 20 minutes to
4:00 in the afternoon.

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Russ Targ and Hella Hammid are
in the First Royal Laboratory

01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:53.850 align:middle line:90%
at SRI.

01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Hal has left SRI.

01:24:55.730 --> 01:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
He will select a randomly
chosen destination.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I was looking up at this
structure that must be three,

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:12.110 align:middle line:10%
four stories high, with
zig-zags going horizontally,

01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:16.200 align:middle line:10%
like a series of mountain
peaks on top of each other.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.870 align:middle line:10%
And they're just shapes.

01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:21.590 align:middle line:10%
Inside of the structure seems
to be open to the sky too.

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:25.560 align:middle line:10%
Squares within squares within
squares, going downward,

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.136 align:middle line:10%
like into a trough.

01:25:27.136 --> 01:25:31.740 align:middle line:10%
It's definitely some
kind of a conduit.

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This is just where
Hal Puthoff was standing

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Hella Hammid's
very first remote viewing.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps the most
dangerous secret of all,

01:25:41.515 --> 01:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the one that Russell Targ
has worked his whole life

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.105 align:middle line:84%
to release, is that
anybody can be psychic.

01:25:47.105 --> 01:25:51.930 align:middle line:90%


01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have a target
now that requires a drawing

01:25:55.530 --> 01:26:00.650 align:middle line:84%
or a description, so I'd like
you to quiet your mind and make

01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
a little sketch of the
surprising images that show up

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.700 align:middle line:90%
in your awareness.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:14.460 align:middle line:90%


01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:18.830 align:middle line:10%
You want to get on paper the
shape and the form pertaining

01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:21.260 align:middle line:10%
to Paul's location.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:25.247 align:middle line:84%
We have Paul and Cynthia in
a bright green dress located

01:26:25.247 --> 01:26:26.330 align:middle line:90%
in some interesting place.

01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:33.040 align:middle line:90%


01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.072 align:middle line:84%
Do we have any falling
water in the audience?

01:26:36.072 --> 01:26:38.642 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
waterfall coming down.

01:26:38.642 --> 01:26:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> This page is the waterfall.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>> My primary purpose in coming
to this conference is actually

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:48.430 align:middle line:10%
to see what I can do to become
a world-class remote viewer.

01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I couldn't believe it,
but it's different when you

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:56.570 align:middle line:10%
actually do it.

01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:58.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I have no formal training.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.970 align:middle line:10%
It's really about sending
the message across to people

01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:06.492 align:middle line:10%
that if you put your mind and
heart to something, you know,

01:27:06.492 --> 01:27:07.450 align:middle line:10%
everything is possible.

01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:09.460 align:middle line:90%
The world is your oyster.

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.920 align:middle line:10%
>> When a whole room of
people are able to do that,

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.780 align:middle line:10%
it's not just me.

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.670 align:middle line:10%
It's not just my imagination.

01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:17.760 align:middle line:90%
It's all of us.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's
the science part.

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody really
wants hard core data.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.063 align:middle line:90%


01:27:24.063 --> 01:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's still a
question of what it means to be

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.992 align:middle line:84%
really human, and what it means
to be a proper human being,

01:27:29.992 --> 01:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
whatever that might mean, and
what is the essence of who we

01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:33.450 align:middle line:90%
are?

01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
the world actually

01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:38.010 align:middle line:84%
had access to that
answer, I think

01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:39.211 align:middle line:90%
it would change everything.

01:27:39.211 --> 01:27:42.248 align:middle line:90%


01:27:42.248 --> 01:27:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's pretty good.

01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm used to Las Vegas.

01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:46.990 align:middle line:90%


01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Psychic abilities are real,
and you have these abilities.

01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:55.655 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got a free
ESP tester on the internet.

01:27:55.655 --> 01:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time we finished,
we knew more about our remote

01:27:58.030 --> 01:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
viewers than NASA knew
about its astronauts.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing different
about them at all.

01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:03.850 align:middle line:90%
These are just normal people.

01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Like musical ability,
you've got virtuosos

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
at one end of the scale, and
you've got tone deaf people

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:09.490 align:middle line:90%
at the other.

01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just in our culture, no one
values, quote, "ESP function."

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:19.638 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just being human is
basically what it's all about.

01:28:19.638 --> 01:28:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that psychic
ability is much more common

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:24.150 align:middle line:90%
than we think?

01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Even internal agents
at CIA back in 1975

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
were secretly doing it,
according to original program

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.700 align:middle line:90%
manager Ken Kress.

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it turns out a
couple of people around OTS,

01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:39.210 align:middle line:10%
a lady by the name Francine
and a man by the name of Ed,

01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:42.800 align:middle line:10%
they decided they
wanted to be subjects.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Subjects.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.360 align:middle line:10%
And they were CIA employees now.

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.615 align:middle line:10%
These were not SRI employees.

01:28:50.615 --> 01:28:55.490 align:middle line:10%
I actually got them involved
with a Libyan analyst.

01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I got gibberish as I remember
from Francine, but you know,

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Ed was an engineer.

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So he comes up, like Pat,
with very specific stuff.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.570 align:middle line:84%
He says what I see is a
Soviet radar that is involved

01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:10.520 align:middle line:90%
with an air defense system.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.290 align:middle line:84%
He goes on and on
with all this stuff.

01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I package all this up,
send it to the Libyan analyst,

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and he said, you know, we
have an agent that we have not

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:27.220 align:middle line:90%
vetted who says similar things.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
that's news to me.

01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> See, when they were with us,
it was not clear whether they

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.850 align:middle line:84%
had come to see if there
is defects in our model,

01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
or they had come to
be trained, or both.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, there may have
been a slight subterfuge,

01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:48.800 align:middle line:90%
shall we say.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I might have sent them
out there as evaluators,

01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and they may have been
motivated as participants.

01:29:58.870 --> 01:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> By 1981, the program
had become more and more

01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:04.000 align:middle line:90%
operational.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The government was less and
less interested in research.

01:30:07.190 --> 01:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be free
of all this secrecy.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:13.658 align:middle line:84%
>> From a scientific
standpoint, was not so good.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, of course
from the funding standpoint,

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't complain.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I brought that to
our contracting officer,

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Russ, you know
we're not doing research

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:24.380 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
will you look at this?

01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:27.913 align:middle line:84%
Will you think about
what we're doing?

01:30:27.913 --> 01:30:29.710 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not paid to think.

01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm paid to find out what DIA
wants you to do and then see

01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:35.830 align:middle line:90%
that you do it.

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I was heartbroken.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Hal and Ingo were more
secretive than ever,

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and now Ingo was in charge
of the Army's psychics

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and had made the
program so complicated

01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:49.360 align:middle line:90%
that only he could teach it.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I got a note
from my partner,

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
questioning whether
I was really making

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.440 align:middle line:90%
a contribution to the program.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What the most interesting
data at SRI pointed to was

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.650 align:middle line:84%
exactly why Russell
wanted to leave.

01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:04.950 align:middle line:90%


01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:08.520 align:middle line:84%
It was a secret so big, he
felt that if the general public

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.440 align:middle line:84%
could truly get it, it might
bring enemies together,

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and it might even
change the world.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:16.810 align:middle line:90%


01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Russell was kind of the
idea man who was always kind

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
of pushing the bad scientist
type of thing where he actually

01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:27.605 align:middle line:90%
looked the part to some degree.

01:31:27.605 --> 01:31:33.780 align:middle line:90%


01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When I decided to leave, this
was in 1985 when we had dozens

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.360 align:middle line:84%
of psychics, and
lots of laboratories,

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:43.805 align:middle line:84%
and people out there as
consultants, and so on.

01:31:43.805 --> 01:31:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
spending all my time

01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
not doing research, but
handling personnel issues,

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and funding issues, and
writing grants and proposals.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd get up in the morning
and say, well, you know,

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.130 align:middle line:84%
actually I could be
getting back to research.

01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Mister Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.

01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I say no more secrets.

01:32:06.450 --> 01:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SRI's intelligence work
with psychics would go

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:11.760 align:middle line:84%
on for another decade,
mostly unnoticed until one

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.460 align:middle line:84%
of their greatest covert
triumphs became their most

01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:16.170 align:middle line:90%
infamous leak.

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember Jimmy Carter's
telling of finding the downed

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Russian bomber in the Congo?

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, President Carter
recounted that during a talk

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to Emery University,
accidentally outing

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:33.120 align:middle line:90%
our top secret program to CNN.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Students submitted
questions on numerous topics,

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:38.940 align:middle line:10%
both serious and
lighthearted, and as always,

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.210 align:middle line:10%
President Carter
answered them all.

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The release of that
information contributed

01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:46.305 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the remote
viewing program at SRI.

01:32:46.305 --> 01:32:53.280 align:middle line:90%


01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.230 align:middle line:10%
>> After Russell and
Hal left the program,

01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:57.900 align:middle line:10%
it continued under Ed May,
but eventually confronted

01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.740 align:middle line:10%
the giggle factor.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So I would ask the
intelligence community to watch

01:33:01.290 --> 01:33:03.120 align:middle line:10%
what we do for the
next few years.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>> CIA publicly derided
the Army-run program,

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.180 align:middle line:10%
and in the end, they were
asked to take it on again.

01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>> A pretty low priority for
the intelligence community,

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.410 align:middle line:10%
and it's better
done on the outside.

01:33:13.410 --> 01:33:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead, they commissioned
a third party report to quote,

01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:19.860 align:middle line:84%
"see if it had been viable
to operational intelligence."

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's our
report for tonight.

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.570 align:middle line:10%
>> So what do all these
stories add up to?

01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the two experts
commissioned by the CIA report

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:29.280 align:middle line:90%
disagree.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.200 align:middle line:84%
First, there's
psychologist Ray Hyman

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.730 align:middle line:90%
from the University of Oregon.

01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:35.640 align:middle line:10%
>> My considered judgment, if
someone pushed me hard right

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.590 align:middle line:10%
now, I'd have to say the
odds are 99 to 1 that

01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:42.150 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing
to remote viewing.

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:45.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I think remote viewing has
been demonstrated over the 20

01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:47.750 align:middle line:10%
years of work that has been
sponsored by the government.

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:50.592 align:middle line:10%
>> Ed May was very upset at the
way the AIR report was done.

01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:52.050 align:middle line:10%
He was very upset
that they did not

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:54.007 align:middle line:10%
look at the operational
remote viewing,

01:33:54.007 --> 01:33:55.590 align:middle line:10%
and that they did
not allow us to talk

01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:57.935 align:middle line:10%
to the operational viewers.

01:33:57.935 --> 01:33:59.310 align:middle line:10%
I think he was
quite disappointed

01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:03.002 align:middle line:10%
that they narrowed the focus
so much so that really, it

01:34:03.002 --> 01:34:05.460 align:middle line:10%
might have been a predetermined
conclusion that they wanted

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.050 align:middle line:10%
to kill the program.

01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that anybody who
says we haven't proven it yet

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.980 align:middle line:84%
hasn't really
looked at the data.

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I think frankly, people don't
want to look at the data.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.030 align:middle line:90%
They have their world views.

01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:17.502 align:middle line:84%
They don't want those
world views rocked.

01:34:17.502 --> 01:34:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I think anybody who looks
at it with a real open mind

01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:21.660 align:middle line:90%
would be convinced.

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I became 100% certain
that it was real acquisition

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.130 align:middle line:90%
of information.

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I became 100% certain that
it had potentially real

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:35.340 align:middle line:90%
intelligence significance.

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I became 100% certain
that it never would.

01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What I thought were the
issues that would make this

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.230 align:middle line:84%
a useful tool were both ignored,
denied, and in addition,

01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:53.760 align:middle line:84%
later dropped, which is
screening of subjects to find

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.750 align:middle line:90%
the superstars.

01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:59.100 align:middle line:10%
>> You're tested carefully
to find your special talent.

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Using the tools that I
thought we had identified,

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.910 align:middle line:10%
which were politically
not correct then to use,

01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:09.820 align:middle line:10%
and which are politically
impossible to use today.

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:13.040 align:middle line:90%


01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.385 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you're here.

01:35:14.385 --> 01:35:16.170 align:middle line:10%
You really arrived.

01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:18.480 align:middle line:10%
You can loosen up a bit now.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You would have
a latent ability,

01:35:21.150 --> 01:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that maybe a lot of humans have,
that you'd be able to tease out

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.620 align:middle line:84%
of some people with some sort of
training program or something,

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and you'd end up
with what ended up.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:38.250 align:middle line:90%


01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> After we did our
report, a few months later,

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe a year later, I received
a phone call from somebody who

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
worked high up in
the government,

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to know
if this was for real.

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.168 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I stand by
what I wrote in the report.

01:35:51.168 --> 01:35:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm going
to see if I can get access

01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to the operational work.

01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:57.293 align:middle line:84%
He called me back and he
said he got access to it.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:58.710 align:middle line:84%
None of the boxes
had been opened.

01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:01.308 align:middle line:90%


01:36:01.308 --> 01:36:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Jessica is the president
of the American Statistical

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Society, and she
says by the numbers,

01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing has a higher
efficacy than aspirin.

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:12.150 align:middle line:84%
What was the CIA trying so hard
to hide that they wouldn't even

01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:14.065 align:middle line:84%
allow their best
data to be seen?

01:36:14.065 --> 01:36:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And why did the CIA dislike
those regular Joe Army guys

01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:18.960 align:middle line:90%
so much?

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We had the total support of
five administrations in a row.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Five straight administrations
supported us, Russell.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Privately.

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:36.170 align:middle line:90%


01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a very
illuminating trip.

01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
You never know who
your friends are.

01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Since I was told by the
DCI the project was over,

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.440 align:middle line:90%
that was it.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It was over.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.680 align:middle line:90%


01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Ken was removed as CIA
program manager shortly before

01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Pat Price's death, and he
assumes that CIA involvement

01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:57.930 align:middle line:90%
ended with Price.

01:36:57.930 --> 01:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I heard that they were
discussing the Stargate program

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.640 align:middle line:90%
out of channel.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.015 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they were talking

01:37:03.015 --> 01:37:06.005 align:middle line:84%
about a classified program
in an unclassified area.

01:37:06.005 --> 01:37:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
security violation.

01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We need to investigate
this further.

01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The gamble was, ignore
it, and it would go away.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The suggestion to me was
that, OK, let people just

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:18.980 align:middle line:90%
wonder about it.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you start
complaining about it,

01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:23.572 align:middle line:84%
it will affirm that
we do have a program.

01:37:23.572 --> 01:37:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
want to go that route.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.038 align:middle line:90%


01:37:28.038 --> 01:37:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Russell's first interview
with one of the most

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.160 align:middle line:84%
spectacular spies from his
SRI days was a no-show.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Later, the agent called to
say they were still doing it

01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and were afraid
to talk about it.

01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond the giggle factor,
what was the big deal?

01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:46.050 align:middle line:90%
What does all of this mean?

01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Could we be missing
the big picture here?

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's not right.

01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I told you before, two people
that I trust that are--

01:37:58.630 --> 01:38:00.180 align:middle line:84%
one of whom is in
a position to know

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:03.930 align:middle line:84%
says that the program
is still going on.

01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how useful
is remote viewing?

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
How far would Russell go to
tell the world what had become

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.297 align:middle line:90%
painfully obvious to him?

01:38:14.297 --> 01:38:16.130 align:middle line:84%
This was something that
Russell was inspired

01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to consider after
witnessing Ingo predict

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that Chinese A-bomb test
three days in advance,

01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and similar work
by Steven Schwartz.

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it involved precognition,
or seeing the future.

01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The final straw was when he
received a package in the mail

01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:35.653 align:middle line:84%
from the ghost of an old friend
regarding some water towers

01:38:35.653 --> 01:38:36.945 align:middle line:90%
that had haunted him for years.

01:38:36.945 --> 01:38:39.540 align:middle line:90%


01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I get the impression of
a water treatment plant.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
It looks like water
storage tanks.

01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:50.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a service room down here.

01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:53.652 align:middle line:84%
>> In Pat Price's first
series of experiments,

01:38:53.652 --> 01:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
he got the shape and dimensions
of the swimming pool target

01:38:56.110 --> 01:38:58.030 align:middle line:90%
within 12 inches.

01:38:58.030 --> 01:39:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But he also called it a
water treatment plant,

01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
even drawing water
towers, which missed

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.960 align:middle line:90%
the whole point of the target.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Years after
Pat Price's death,

01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I received a historical
picture book.

01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a gift from the
city manager of Palo Alto.

01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:17.980 align:middle line:10%
When I opened the picture book
to Rinconada Park 75 years ago,

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.070 align:middle line:10%
it had been a water
purification plant.

01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And the two water tanks that
Price had indicated indeed

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:28.000 align:middle line:84%
were right where he put them,
and they would undoubtedly

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.650 align:middle line:84%
have been the tallest
thing in the city

01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:35.340 align:middle line:90%
of Palo Alto 75 years ago.

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:38.440 align:middle line:84%
With Pat's reminder of
timeless awareness in hand,

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I hatched a plan to
ditch the spy business

01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and try and wake up the world.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:47.700 align:middle line:90%


01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the commodities
exchange in New York City,

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.370 align:middle line:90%
circa 1983.

01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It was right here Russell
Targ's new company, Delphi,

01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:59.040 align:middle line:84%
decided to tell the world
that they were psychic.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.560 align:middle line:84%

looking back at Earth,

01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:00.830 align:middle line:84%
would kind of call
it the big picture

01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:03.920 align:middle line:84%
effect of seeing things
in a new perspective,

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.670 align:middle line:84%
seeing Earth in the perspective
of being in the heavens.

01:48:07.670 --> 01:48:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And that we're just a small
part of this huge universe

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:13.316 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

01:48:13.316 --> 01:48:16.720 align:middle line:90%


01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.600 align:middle line:10%
>> I had completed my major
task for going to the moon,

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:27.405 align:middle line:10%
and was on the way home, and
was observing the passing

01:48:27.405 --> 01:48:28.205 align:middle line:10%
of the heavens.

01:48:28.205 --> 01:48:31.050 align:middle line:90%


01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:34.950 align:middle line:90%
The magnificence of all of this.

01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:39.080 align:middle line:84%
What this triggered
in my visioning,

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:41.605 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Sanskrit
is called samadhi.

01:48:41.605 --> 01:48:44.730 align:middle line:90%


01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It means that you see things
with your senses the way

01:48:47.850 --> 01:48:50.810 align:middle line:84%
they are, but you
experience them viscerally

01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and internally as a unity and a
oneness accompanied by ecstasy.

01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:59.070 align:middle line:90%


01:48:59.070 --> 01:49:03.915 align:middle line:84%
We are star dust, and we're
all one in that sense.

01:49:03.915 --> 01:49:17.350 align:middle line:90%


01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:21.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words, instead
of just serving yourself,

01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.080 align:middle line:84%
what it tends to help
you do is to realize

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.660 align:middle line:84%
you're a part of
a larger reality,

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and to serve that larger
reality in a proper way.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:34.540 align:middle line:90%


01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm not so sure it was all
about collecting intelligence

01:49:37.450 --> 01:49:38.650 align:middle line:90%
and how well we did.

01:49:38.650 --> 01:49:44.830 align:middle line:10%
The evolution of consciousness
itself is expanding.

01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness itself can evolve,
and I believe that's probably

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:50.330 align:middle line:90%
towards what I call empathy.

01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:54.420 align:middle line:90%


01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The main idea from all of
our research is that there is no

01:49:58.170 --> 01:50:05.060 align:middle line:84%
separation, especially no
separation in consciousness.

01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:08.630 align:middle line:84%
More than machinery,
we need our humanity.

01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> If the world were to
accept this research,

01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:15.880 align:middle line:84%
we would have to recognize
that we are not isolated within

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:16.680 align:middle line:90%
our brains.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:20.080 align:middle line:90%


01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.620 align:middle line:84%
We would have to recognize
that we live in the Earth,

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:25.420 align:middle line:90%
not on the Earth.

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We live embedded in
the biosphere of Earth.

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And that all consciousness
is interconnected and

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:35.710 align:middle line:90%
interrelated.

01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why we can
transmit the power of love,

01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:41.050 align:middle line:90%
the power of healing.

01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's very subliminal,
but it definitely exists.

01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:52.730 align:middle line:90%


01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:55.680 align:middle line:10%
>> When I came across
this, I said, you know,

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.170 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of people
who will think you're nuts.

01:50:58.170 --> 01:51:00.590 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, hang on.

01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you're not.

01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:05.600 align:middle line:84%
We should always be
open to our imagination,

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:08.870 align:middle line:84%
because once in a while
some of the imaginations

01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:10.590 align:middle line:90%
will come true.

01:51:10.590 --> 01:51:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's time to
close up and move on.

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:27.210 align:middle line:90%


01:51:27.210 --> 01:51:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So Hella returned to Los
Angeles to resume her life

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.020 align:middle line:90%
as a professional photographer.

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.670 align:middle line:90%
She died of cancer in 1992.

01:51:36.670 --> 01:51:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But not before she uncovered
the lost temple of Alexandria,

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, with Steven Schwartz
and the Egyptian government.

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.910 align:middle line:84%
They placed the first
stake within 12 inches

01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:48.860 align:middle line:84%
of where it had been buried
for thousands of years

01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and put the skeptics to
rest, at least for that day.

01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> She was given no information
beyond the general hilltop

01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:55.420 align:middle line:90%
location.

01:51:55.420 --> 01:52:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Things are going to change,
because science is changing.

01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:03.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Ingo took the closure of
the Army program hard and went

01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:05.830 align:middle line:10%
into seclusion.

01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:08.860 align:middle line:10%
We reconnected in later
years and had a chance

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:11.170 align:middle line:10%
to talk about old times.

01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:14.410 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to talk
about the future,

01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:19.780 align:middle line:10%
because I think that we're far
too much trapped in the past.

01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:30.730 align:middle line:90%


01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:34.990 align:middle line:10%
>> And Sam got very talented
cellists who had not remote

01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:35.860 align:middle line:10%
viewed.

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:39.820 align:middle line:84%
They went into an expanded
state and got impressions.

01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They then took it
up to the composers.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Atmospheric.

01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:48.290 align:middle line:90%


01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Two not opposing but
interrelated forces.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:56.538 align:middle line:90%
Trickle it up and down.

01:52:56.538 --> 01:52:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What was the feedback?

01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:59.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, they didn't know
what was in the envelope.

01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very, very close.

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very descriptive of bugs.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So playing it and listening
to it kind of makes you itch.

01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:12.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Kit Green says he still
consults for the CIA.

01:53:12.570 --> 01:53:13.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Green.

01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Think, think, think, think.

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And I had.

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought about
it for many years.

01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:21.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you the answer.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.780 align:middle line:10%
The most precious secrets
are hidden in plain sight.

01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:27.240 align:middle line:10%
That's a stupid expression,
but you know what?

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:29.460 align:middle line:10%
It happens sometimes to be true.

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:32.330 align:middle line:10%
>> He told me collaborates
regularly with Hal,

01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:34.830 align:middle line:10%
but on what, neither
one of them will say.

01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:37.810 align:middle line:10%


01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:41.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I've got it going
through me, if you can see.

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Hal Puthoff resigned from
the SRI remote viewing program

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.480 align:middle line:84%
at the height of its success,
but he did go back to remote

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:50.470 align:middle line:90%
viewing at least one more time.

01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Hal repeated my silver
forecasting experiment for his

01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:55.490 align:middle line:90%
child's high school.

01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:59.990 align:middle line:10%
He raised $25,000 from the stock
market for a class field trip

01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:01.520 align:middle line:10%
to Washington.

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Then he went back to
seeking to extract energy

01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:06.770 align:middle line:84%
from the vacuum in
his Austin laboratory.

01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:11.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we've got our
hands in every pot.

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out that Kit and
Hal really were collaborating.

01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:18.520 align:middle line:10%
Kit brought Hal into a top
secret Pentagon UFO assessment

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.821 align:middle line:10%
program, revealed in December
2017 by "The New York Times."

01:54:23.821 --> 01:54:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and Hal says they've
recovered UFO debris,

01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:29.330 align:middle line:90%
but that's another story.

01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Pat Price's grave in North
Hollywood remains unmarked,

01:54:33.610 --> 01:54:35.300 align:middle line:90%
and his death remains a mystery.

01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:38.990 align:middle line:90%


01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And as for Russell Targ, he
continues to tell his story,

01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
showing people just like you
and me all around the world that

01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:47.630 align:middle line:90%
we're all psychic.

01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of
the film they say,

01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:52.760 align:middle line:84%
no animals were harmed in
the making of this film.

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.130 align:middle line:10%
So I'd like to ask
you, is it fair to say

01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:58.910 align:middle line:10%
that no physics were harmed
in the making of this film?

01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:02.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Physics isn't, but
some physicists might be.

01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:10.000 align:middle line:90%
