00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Water-- the most common
substance on Earth.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It is with us every
moment of our lives.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.225 align:middle line:84%
Like the human body, the Earth
maintains a constant amount

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:05.725 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
If the quantity of water
is reduced, or at least one

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of its amazing features is
changed, then life on Earth

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
will vanish.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Just like you, Earth is
a living, dynamic being.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It has veins and
arteries with water

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
flowing through it,
which are connected

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.754 align:middle line:84%
to one large thriving
heart, the ocean.

00:01:32.754 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It evaporates water
and returns it back

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to the hydrologic cycle
as rain, falling down

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
on mountain tops, which again
form veins and arteries that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:90%
return to the ocean.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It is this constant
water circulation

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.985 align:middle line:90%
that keeps the planet alive.

00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
We are just like the surface of
the Earth-- at least 70% water.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
We also have a heart and 60,000
miles of veins and arteries.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And like our planet,
it is water that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
gives us life, replenishing
ourselves in a continuous water

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The system of the
universe exists

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:90%
as a single, perfect organism.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
All of its parts,
including us and our Earth,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
are inseparably bound together
by huge streams of information.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And on our planet,
water plays the key role

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.292 align:middle line:84%
in how the information
is exchanged.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
In effect, it is the
medium through which

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:90%
all nature is governed.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth is a giant
container of water in which

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
all forms of life arose.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.115 align:middle line:84%
And every living thing is,
itself, essentially a container

00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:58.615 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Depending on age, a human being
is made up of 70 to 90% water.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
An adult drinks approximately
2.5 liters of water each day

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to sustain his
normal life functions.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.739 align:middle line:84%
Another 1.5 liters is
absorbed through the skin

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.905 align:middle line:90%
during bathing or showering.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Science has not yet been able
to answer the question of why

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
water is the only substance
on the planet that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:84%
can exist in three states--
liquid, solid, and gaseous.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Why does water have the highest
surface tension of all liquids?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Why is it the most
powerful solvent on Earth?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And how in defiance
of the Earth's gravity

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
is water able to rise through
the trunks of gigantic trees

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.905 align:middle line:84%
against tens of
atmospheres of pressure?

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
In a seed, for example,
it reaches 400 atmospheres

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of germination.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why a plant shoot
can break through asphalt

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
with ease.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The water, of course,
remains water.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But its structure,
like a nervous system,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:90%
reacts to any irritation.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:90%
The water molecule is a dipole.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
One end is charged
more negatively

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and the other more positively.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a well known phenomenon.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
A molecule acting through
its negatively charged end

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:84%
can attract another molecule
by its positively charged end.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.745 align:middle line:90%
And then another molecule.

00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
This is how the structure
of water is formed.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
It is fluid and short lived.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, among the
changing forms,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:90%
one can see stable formations.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
These are called clusters.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It is within these
structures that water retains

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.255 align:middle line:90%
information it has captured.

00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Any substance coming
into contact with water

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:90%
leaves a trace in the water.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Had our ancestors
guessed this when

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
they used silver vessels to
turn ordinary water into healing

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:90%
water?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s in a closed
laboratory in Germany,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:90%
something inexplicable occurred.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
A laboratory assistant
dropped a vacuum

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
sealed ampule containing
virulent poison into a vessel

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:90%
with distilled water.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Trying to conceal her blunder,
she just left it in the water.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
The ampule was discovered
only three days later.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.652 align:middle line:84%
Since it was sealed, it did
not pose any special hazard

00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:90%
and the matter was closed.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.465 align:middle line:84%
Later, the water was
given to laboratory mice--

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
--and they died.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Immediately the water
was thoroughly tested.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Chemically, it proved
to be impeccably clean.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It meant that the water without
direct contact with the poison

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:90%
somehow adopted its properties.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it received
negative information

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
from the poison.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.705 align:middle line:84%
A fantastic hypotheses
was put forward,

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
a hypotheses that could explain
water's unpredictable behavior.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Water has memory.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Experiments done in many
countries around the world

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:84%
have shown that water
receives and makes

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
an imprint of any outside
influence, remembering

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
everything that occurs in
the space that surrounds it.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It makes no difference
where the water is located.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
If you transport
water to outer space,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
it remains sensitive
to what it encounters.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:84%
NASA scientists discovered
this when they released water

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:90%
in a low gravity environment.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Pure water is hard to
make, it's hard to get,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's kind of reactive.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:90%
It's very polar liquid.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it tends to dissolve
things and grab things,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.789 align:middle line:84%
and they become what
we call surface active.

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
If you take a drop of oil
or something like that,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:90%
it won't do that.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Ethanol or alcohol
won't do that.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
But water is a highly
contaminable surface.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
If you fill up a
water balloon, there

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
was some junk on the
mandril that they

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.775 align:middle line:84%
used to make the balloon
in the first place that's

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of the balloon
that's instantly in the liquid.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you deploy that, that
junk that's in the liquid then

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:90%
goes to the surface.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it changes the
surface properties somewhat.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Water drops
oscillate in reaction

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:90%
to the burst balloon membrane.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It takes 45 minutes for
it to stabilize and form

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:90%
a perfect sphere.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Further experiments
at low gravity

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
allowed astronauts to study a
sphere of water 75 millimeters

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
in diameter with an
air bubble inside.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
When water droplets were
injected into the bubble,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
they created collision
dynamics in action.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
Most of the collisions
were created

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
in a rebound or elastic
fashion, bouncing off

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:90%
each other and the wall.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But on occasion, an internal
bubble would oscillate

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and the momentum would carry
it across the interface

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:90%
in a mass transfer.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.466 align:middle line:84%
The structure of water means
how its molecules are organized.

00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
We can see how water molecules
join together into groups.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Scientists came up with the
idea that these clusters

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
work as memory cells of a
certain sort in which water

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
records the whole history of
its relationship with the world

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:90%
as if on magnetic tape.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:10%
>>If you consider a cluster as
a group of specific molecules,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:10%
then it can survive only
a short amount of time.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.987 align:middle line:10%
But if you consider it as a
structure whereby molecules can

00:09:22.987 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:10%
leave and other
molecules come in,

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:10%
the cluster can last effectively
for a very long time.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>The stability of
the cluster structures

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
confirm the
hypothesis that water

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
is capable of recording
and storing information.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:10%
>>It may be the single most
malleable computer, which can--

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:10%
it's like a computer memory.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:10%
It's a memory of information.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
You must know how
it is arranged.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It is like the alphabet.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
If I give you the alphabet,
you don't know a word,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
you don't a letter, you
don't know a sentence.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So the molecular structure
is the alphabet of water.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.605 align:middle line:84%
And you must make a
sentence out of water.

00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And you can change the sentence.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>This leads us to the idea that
information is either made up

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.066 align:middle line:90%
of water or exists in it.

00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Like sculptures
that have not yet

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
been created are present
in a piece of clay,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
so the images of all
future living organisms

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:90%
were present in the water.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Water merely brought to life
a preexisting conception.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.705 align:middle line:84%
But for any process to
begin requires an impulse.

00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Wise men of ancient times
believed that for life to arise

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:90%
was a primordial divine spark.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
This spark imprinted
in the water

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
the sequence of
future development.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
The entire course of evolution
provides evidence of this.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>There are such animals,
for example, jellyfish.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Jellyfishes are 99.9% water.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And we as biologists
study the left 0.1%

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
of these jellyfish in order to
understand how this bulk water,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:90%
why it is a life.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Probably this water is
alive, and this 0.1%

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:90%
simply allows it to be a life.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We ourselves when we're newborns
or when we were fetuses,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
we were 95 or even
more percent of water.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
We're already alive.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that scientists should
look more closely at how water

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:90%
interacts with their molecules.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
At a molecular level, it
creates the structure of DNA.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have the
DNA helix without water.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It creates the
structure of proteins.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies wouldn't
work without the water.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Water is a universal
computer that

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
reveals any biological
program, and thus water

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is the only thing
that can change it.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Water has a life
cycle of its own,

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:84%
flowing from melting glaciers
down steep mountain slopes.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
During the journey down,
the crystal streams

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
are filled with the
energy of the sun.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:84%
They absorb information about
the properties of the soil,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:84%
about the composition
of minerals and rocks.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
The impressions of such
water are full of fresh air.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
These impacts change
water structurally.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, for a
human being, water

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
remains the same: without
taste, without color,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and without odor.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Yet it's impossible to find
identical water on Earth.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Water is like a
clean sheet of paper,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
which can be changed
by a tiny brush stroke.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The great artist
Leonardo da Vinci

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
wrote, "Water assumes a
special character as many times

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
as there are different
places where it flows."

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
On Okinawa island
in Japan, people

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:90%
live incredibly long lives.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
They suffer very few cases
of common human diseases

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:84%
such as diabetes,
arteriosclerosis, and cancer.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the explanations
is that they

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
drink water vitalized by the
coral their island rests on.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
These natural bodies are not
only stunningly beautiful,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:90%
but also extremely long lived.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
The most ancient of them are
more than 600 million years

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The coral imprints the
water with information

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
about longevity, which
is then passed over

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.805 align:middle line:84%
to the water medium of the human
body, tuning it for long life.

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
75% of the human body
consists of water.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:84%
If the body loses 2%
of its liquid content,

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:90%
we become thirsty.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
If it loses 10%, we
start hallucinating.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:84%
If the body loses over
12% of water, we die.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
In the language of the Pemon
Indian tribe in Venezuela,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Roraima is translated as
the mother of all waters.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:84%
A group of Russian
biophysicists set out

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
for this destination
in January, 2005

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to collect a unique sample
of water which scientists say

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
has never been in direct
contact with human beings.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.005 align:middle line:84%
Such water exists in only one
place on Earth-- in Venezuela.

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
According to one
hypothesis, a continent

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
called Gondwana existed
in the southern hemisphere

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:90%
during the Paleozoic era.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Powerful tectonic processes
occurring in the Earth's crust

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.665 align:middle line:84%
3.5 million years ago split
it into several parts.

00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
As a result of these changes,
some segments of the continents

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
sank, while those resting
on granite substrates

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
remained at their
previous level.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Elevated plateaus were
formed, which the Indians

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%
called tepuis, meaning pillars.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Roraima is the largest of them.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a really remote
place, very hard to get to.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Three days of travel through the
savanna, and then the jungles.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Then you climb an
800 meter wall.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It takes a certain
amount of enthusiasm.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we can say that
the water we have there

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.045 align:middle line:90%
is in a unique, virgin state.

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>There is always a
large cloud over Roraima.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
As evening approaches,
a light haze appears.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
When the moon comes out
from behind the mountains,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the mist begins to glow
with an even blue light.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that light, it is visible
how fine droplets of moisture

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:90%
are hanging in the still air.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
The slightest breath of a
breeze, and this watery dust

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:90%
forms into drops.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the origin of the
rain which rushes down

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.875 align:middle line:90%
in countless waterfalls.

00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.764 align:middle line:84%
>>So today is January 30,
water collection number 16.

00:17:20.764 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we shall pack
it all up in foil.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And in this form, this
water will hold its energy

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
for several days with
the air of these places.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll arrive
in Saint Petersburg,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and we'll calmly carry out
our laboratory analysis

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.890 align:middle line:90%
several thousand miles away.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And only then will we be
able to draw any conclusions.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Professor
Korotkov's laboratory

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
has developed an instrument
that can determine

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:90%
the energetics of water.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It works on the basis
of the Kirlian effect.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything that enters a
strong electromagnetic field

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:90%
begins to emit light.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
The greater energy the object
possesses, the brighter

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:90%
it shines.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.721 align:middle line:84%
The water from Venezuela was
compared with ordinary drinking

00:18:14.721 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>We can say that this water
is not double, not triple,

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
but it is 40,000
times more active.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So these are really two
fundamentally different

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:90%
substances.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And water of this
type, this water,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
which immediately
activates the body,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:90%
it activates the whole system.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why there,
where the Indians,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:84%
despite the deprivation in
which they live, live very long

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
lives and are very
happy, they absolutely

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
do not want civilization
to come to them.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>This water also had an
effect on the science team,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
even though their visit to the
area lasted less than a week.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Korotkov used a
special instrument

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to measure the energy
level of each person

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
at the base of Roraima,
and then two days later

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
after each member
reached the summit.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>And what we found
was really astonishing.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We found that for all
members of the group,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
at the top of Roraima, their
energy field tremendously

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:90%
increased.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And they felt it.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So now, you see this
images of energy field

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:90%
of a person at the sea level.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And you see it sort of
breaks, it's very jagged.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's typical
reflection of condition.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same person,
but at the top of Roraima.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And you see dramatic difference.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.575 align:middle line:90%
>>What is water?

00:20:04.575 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:10%
In water researcher
Viktor Schauberger's view,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:10%
it is a living
substance which can

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.295 align:middle line:10%
die if it is treated poorly.

00:20:14.295 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Schauberger believed that
water is born in the forest.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It falls as rain.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And it filters down
through the rocks,

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
gathering minerals
and trace elements

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:84%
until arriving at the
surface as a spring.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
At this point, water is
full of mother's substances,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
ready to provide life.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Its vitality depends
on how it flows

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
or how it is forced to flow.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.342 align:middle line:84%
Our systems for moving
and processing water

00:20:44.342 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
are designed from
the point of view

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that water is merely a fluid
without life or energy.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So we don't care
how it's treated.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:84%
We make water flow
along straight channels,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:84%
through cylindrical
devices and other shapes

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:90%
that are never found in nature.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:90%
We ignore water's natural path.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Spiral patterns and
arrangements are all around us

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:84%
in the forms of galaxies,
cyclones, and tornadoes.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:84%
These spirals are
everywhere in nature,

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:84%
which has chosen these
formations because they

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
represent the law
of constant change.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
If we want to create a
system for moving water which

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
allows it to remain
vital and alive,

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
we must provide the opportunity
for water to breathe.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Viktor Schauberger's research
on water revitalization

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
inspired the development
of flow forms, which

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:84%
are a series of formed
basins that allow water

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to flow into figure
eight vortical movements,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
causing the water to
pulsate rhythmically.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
The type of movement
in flow forms

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
simulates a mountain stream--
energizing, restructuring,

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and oxygenating water.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Flow forms mimic nature's
flowing movement,

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
plus simulate the heart
rhythms, helping to refresh

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
and reharmonize water.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Vortical treatments of
harmonic frequencies

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is an effective way to eliminate
undesirable information

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
remaining in water after
removal of physical pollutants.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Water makes a long,
difficult journey

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
before arriving in our homes.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>It used to be common knowledge
that a settlement could only

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
occur where there was a
natural source of water.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:10%
Today, whether or
not there is water

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:10%
in a place is of no
importance, because we

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.435 align:middle line:10%
transport water for thousands
of miles using high pressure.

00:22:37.435 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>In nature, rivers and
streams always flow along

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:90%
a smoothly curving course.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.825 align:middle line:84%
But any water system has
multiple right angle turns.

00:22:52.825 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The natural structure
of the water

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
breaks down more and
more with each such turn.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Water from a
water supply system

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
which flows into our
homes through pipes

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:84%
has various forms,
crystals of various forms.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:90%
But they are all deformed.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
That is, they may
look like this.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It can look like this
or have these crystals

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and many other
arrangements, but you won't

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:90%
see any symmetry or beauty.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>We've been forming crystals
for more than a dozen years.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
From our tests, we
came to the conclusion

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that living water forms
more hexagonal crystals,

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and less vibrant or dead water
doesn't form hexagonal shapes.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
What concerns me is that
water from any big city

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
tends not to form
beautiful crystals.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
When water travels in a city,
it collects negative information

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:90%
from the people and pollution.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Also, the more chlorine in
the water, the less crystals

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:90%
can form.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We also have pipes that
make lots of turns.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Imagine if you were water.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.721 align:middle line:84%
You might want to die with
all this unnatural and forced

00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Water that flows in a
floor-paneled heating system

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:90%
is devitalized and rotten.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It sucks energy out of the
people, plants, and animals

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:90%
living in that house.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:90%
It actually steals the energy.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.715 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.715 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>It is well known
that the water

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
supply in many large cities
is a closed loop system.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:84%
After undergoing aggressive
chemical purification

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and passing through
powerful filters,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.486 align:middle line:84%
the water in these systems
is returned to our homes,

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.485 align:middle line:84%
still remembering the
chemicals and the violence

00:24:49.485 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:90%
it was subjected to.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
There are over 100,000 man
made chemicals, including

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceuticals, birth
control pills, toiletries,

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and household cleaners.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
When the liver removes
these toxins from our body,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
they get flushed down the
toilet where they then

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
go into the sewer where many
pass intact through our sewage

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.560 align:middle line:84%
treatment facilities and
filters and are recycled back

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
into our municipal water system
for us to consume once again.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:10%
Even stronger, however, is
the informational pollution

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:10%
that the water accumulates as it
flows down miles of long pipes,

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.625 align:middle line:10%
through thousands and thousands
of houses and apartments.

00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>We pollute water
spiritually, and this

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
happens on a huge scale.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:84%
The water adopts
all of the hatred,

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:90%
all of the malice, the stress.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The water is almost dead by
the time it enters our body.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:10%
>>We subjected water to super
weak magnetic field impulses.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:10%
These fields are tens
of thousands of times

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.195 align:middle line:10%
weaker than the Earth's
natural magnetic field.

00:26:29.195 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Fish were introduced into water
that was treated in this way,

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and the fish soon produced an
unusual hatch of small fry.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:84%
They differed radically
from the other fish

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
to which they were
related, though they

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:90%
looked as much alike as twins.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Grey stripes appear on the belly
of all these males at once,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.829 align:middle line:84%
along with colored
spots which had not

00:26:56.829 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:90%
been observed previously.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.485 align:middle line:84%
These are called
phenotype changes.

00:27:06.485 --> 00:27:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is of
fundamental importance

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that these changes appear not in
just some of the treated fish,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
but in all of them
at the same time.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>The experiment
resulted in changes

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:84%
not only on the outward
appearance of the fish,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.530 align:middle line:90%
but also in their behavior.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They began to react to outside
stimuli in the same way.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the whole school
had acquired a collective mind.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:41.904 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.904 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>I've studied water
crystals for 15 years.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:84%
What I would really like people
to know through my research

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
or work is that
water has memory.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Masaru Emoto
exposes water to a variety

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:84%
of outside stimuli in his
research laboratory in Japan.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
His researchers capture 50
samples of each water specimen,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
which are frozen, and
after three hours,

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.880 align:middle line:84%
examined in the lab at a
temperature of minus 5 degrees

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:90%
centigrade.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Only a few will reveal
their beautiful structure.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
As the temperature rises
under the microscope,

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
the crystal starts
to grow and expand.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
The researcher captures
its image on camera

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
before it returns
to the liquid state.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful
geometrical wonder

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:84%
expands in six directions
from each corner

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:90%
of its hexagonal base.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
A lateral view reveals
a protrusion that

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:90%
appears at the tip of the cone.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:84%
This is because
ice crystals do not

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
develop two dimensionally,
but rather three dimensionally

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.586 align:middle line:90%
from the center to the edges.

00:29:02.586 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:10%
Water from natural
sources, unlike tap water,

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:10%
provides a wide range of
crystalline formations.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:18.140 align:middle line:10%
This allows us to peek into
the life and health of water.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Living water in good
condition produces

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:10%
beautiful hexagonal crystals,
as we see in these pictures.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
If water gets sick or dies, what
we see changes dramatically.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:10%
We can see how water reacts to
a computer, a television set,

00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:10%
to hard rock, a microwave
oven, a cellphone.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>The basic principle in
the universe is vibration.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And vibration can be created
by the principle of resonance.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Without resonance,
vibration doesn't exist.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is the truth
in the universe.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum world,
very small units of things

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:90%
resonate with each other.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
affirm themselves.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So we are able to reconfirm
the existence of things

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:84%
by seeing them through
this resonance theory.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Max Planck once said
that everything is a wave.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when we write
a word on a sheet of paper

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to water, we can
see that the water crystal

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:90%
changes its form.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It means a transformation
of the water itself

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
under the influence
of frequencies

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that we emit with this word.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>The first word Dr.
Emoto's research team

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:10%
exposed water to was "arigatou,"
Japanese for "thank you."

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:10%
Next, we see what happened
when they used negative words,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:10%
such as "you fool."

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Words of beauty create
beautiful crystals.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.965 align:middle line:10%
Gentle words manifest
delicate crystals.

00:31:30.965 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:10%


00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.860 align:middle line:10%
In crystal form, water
reflects the power of intention

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.759 align:middle line:10%
behind our words.

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, Dr. Masaru
Emoto was the first one

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
to record musical
impressions on water.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:84%
In Dr. Emoto's laboratory,
they presented water

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
with different types of
music, after which they froze

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the water and then
under the microscope

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.945 align:middle line:84%
could clearly see the crystals
that the water had formed.

00:32:03.945 --> 00:32:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.360 align:middle line:10%
Here, we see crystallized
distilled water

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:10%
before music is introduced.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.405 align:middle line:10%
And now the transformation
when it is exposed to Mozart.

00:32:22.405 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.430 align:middle line:84%
This is how water
responded to Beethoven.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is water's
response to something

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.157 align:middle line:84%
more contemporary--
Sting's "Fragile."

00:33:33.157 --> 00:34:19.389 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.870 align:middle line:10%
Other well known examples of
water's hexagonal geometry

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:10%
are snowflakes.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.290 align:middle line:10%
Each one is created by the
conditions in which it grows.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.600 align:middle line:84%
No two are exactly the
same, despite the billions

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.489 align:middle line:84%
of snowflakes that
fall each year.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:10%
The life of a snowflake
begins high in the atmosphere.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:84%
The lone droplet freezes into
a tiny ice bead, which then

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:90%
expands into a hexagonal base.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Each of its six corners
starts to grow a branch,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.010 align:middle line:90%
creating a very complex pattern.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Physicists have calculated that
the number of possible ways

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to grow a snowflake far
exceeds the total number

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:90%
of all atoms in the universe.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you can be pretty
sure that any snowflake you see

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:84%
will be unique, like no other
that has ever fallen to Earth.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:90%
This is a water droplet.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:84%
If we expose water to various
sound frequencies using

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
a technology called
a tonoscope, we

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
can observe various patterns
emerging in its structure.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
As we increase the frequency
at certain key thresholds,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the entire pattern morphs
into a new resonant pattern,

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.150 align:middle line:84%
which is a more complex
expression of the base

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
This happens repeatedly as
the frequency increases.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.265 align:middle line:84%
We can observe familiar
geometrical patterns.

00:36:10.265 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Here we see a perfect
cube, a tetrahedron, a star

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:90%
tetrahedron, the octohedron.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
All of these forms
of sacred geometry

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:84%
were created simply by
achieving the resonant frequency

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:90%
to match the form.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Water and human
beings and plants

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:10%
respond the same way
to resonant energy

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:10%
that your cell phone does
when it picks up the call.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Human beings and
water can respond

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to particular frequencies and
energies applied that way.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can build
up tremendous energy

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:90%
and have tremendous effects.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We grow crystals using
resonant frequencies.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Salt crystals like
the same kind of salt

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
flowing through your
bloodstream right now in water.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:10%
We grow those crystals
using resonant frequencies

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:10%
2 and 1/2 thousand
times faster and bigger.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.048 align:middle line:84%
>>Water perceives every
change in thought or mood.

00:37:27.048 --> 00:37:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The brightest of these
vibrational currents

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.635 align:middle line:90%
is created by love.

00:37:34.635 --> 00:37:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The power of this emotion is
reflected in the word itself.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Our mind is related to
our central nervous system.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we have some emotions
or we have some thought,

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
they directly influence not
only our nervous system,

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:90%
but the whole body.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:84%
First it flows through blood,
then through vegetative system.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So we with our thoughts,
with our emotions,

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:84%
we totally change condition
of the whole body.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Visionary and artist
Leonardo da Vinci

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:90%
came to the same conclusion.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
"Human emotions are water,"
he wrote in his notes,

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
"and it is the form
taken by these flows

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
within the body that determine
the human character."

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Every seed, every embryo begins
its life exclusively in water.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Amniotic fluid plays a role
in the embryo's development

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.200 align:middle line:90%
and preservation.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The amniotic fluid of a pregnant
woman is clustered water.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:10%
Under the microscope, it looks
like clearly formed groups

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.950 align:middle line:10%
of molecules.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:10%
You get the impression
that the water

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:10%
is trying to protect
the life inside,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:10%
directing all the forces
of the mother's body

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:10%
to its protection
and development.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.570 align:middle line:10%
It was discovered that
the cells of a newborn

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:10%
also contain such water.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:84%
When rapidly frozen
and seen under 20,000

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:84%
fold magnification,
it proved to be

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:90%
a crystal of incredible beauty.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Water is the fundamental
element of life,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and is the telephone
to the universe.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And the way we feel,
the way we act,

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:84%
the way we process
our emotions is

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.950 align:middle line:84%
going to have an impact on
the water inside our body

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and the world as a whole.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Emoto conducted another
groundbreaking experiment.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.227 align:middle line:84%
He placed rice in
three glass beakers

00:39:51.227 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:90%
and covered it with water.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And then every day
for a month, he

00:39:53.810 --> 00:40:01.460 align:middle line:84%
said thank you to one beaker,
you're an idiot to the second,

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and the third one he
completely ignored.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:84%
After one month, the rice
that had been thanked

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
began to ferment, giving off
a strong, pleasant aroma.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.755 align:middle line:84%
The rice in the second
beaker turned black.

00:40:28.755 --> 00:40:31.750 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And the rice that was
ignored began to rot.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Emoto feels
that this experiment

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.990 align:middle line:90%
provides an important lesson.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The worst rice samples is
the one that was ignored.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.670 align:middle line:84%
The same can be said
in our daily lives

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:90%
when dealing with children.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Ignoring children is the
worst thing we can do.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if we have to
scold them occasionally,

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
communication is very important.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We should always converse
with them and encourage them.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Ignoring them causes
the greatest harm.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>In this experiment,
Dr. Emoto's researchers

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.160 align:middle line:84%
used a glass of Tokyo
tap water, which

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
seems to be unable to form
crystals, and performed a test.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Participants placed the glass
in the center of their circle

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:90%
and sent gratitude to the water.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Studying the water
under the microscope,

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.885 align:middle line:84%
they started to see
a crystal formation.

00:41:30.885 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Increased magnification showed
the symmetry of the crystal,

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.440 align:middle line:84%
revealing how the tap water was
transformed by the gratitude

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.320 align:middle line:90%
sent by the group.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The crystal continued
to grow, expressing

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:90%
the energies received.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:84%
The tap water from Tokyo finally
produced a beautiful crystal.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>It was interesting to
see children so completely

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
astonished after they witnessed
the difference in Tokyo

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:84%
tap water before and after
they sent the prayer.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Their mothers were
kind of skeptical

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:30.975 align:middle line:90%
before this experiment.

00:42:30.975 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, they said we
really have to believe it.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Scientists in the field
of electrophoton imaging

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:84%
were conducting experiments
measuring the energy of water

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:84%
To establish a baseline, a
drop of water from a test class

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:56.110 align:middle line:84%
was suspended above electrodes
where it was photographed

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.630 align:middle line:90%
using a fiberoptic camera.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The research team then took
the same glass of water

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and performed an experiment
in the power of intention.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Participants focused
on the water,

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:84%
sending positive thoughts
and a healing chant.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:10%
This sample exposed
to positive thoughts

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:10%
was then tested in the exact
same manner as the baseline

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.940 align:middle line:10%
sample.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.030 align:middle line:10%
These measurements
allowed scientists

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:10%
to study the photon
emissions or energy

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.620 align:middle line:10%
level of each water sample.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:84%
When the baseline
drop was compared

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:84%
to the one imprinted
with positive intentions,

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.192 align:middle line:90%
the difference was remarkable.

00:43:43.192 --> 00:43:46.820 align:middle line:84%
The imprinted sample clearly
had more photon emission

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and an increase in stability.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Next, researchers exposed water
to a traditional instrument

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:84%
known for its
meditative qualities.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.360 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous Australians
have performed ceremonies

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
with the didgeridoo
for centuries using

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.065 align:middle line:90%
a circular breathing technique.

00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:10.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:84%
The water showed a significant
increase in energy level,

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:18.820 align:middle line:84%
as evidenced by the computer
data and the resulting images.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>It's clear that water is one
of the most sensitive indicator

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
of any fields that we
have surrounding us.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Professor
Korotkov's laboratory

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.790 align:middle line:84%
has conducted
numerous experiments

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:84%
on the effect of human
emotions on water.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.310 align:middle line:84%
A group of people
were asked to project

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:84%
onto a flask of water
in front of them

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.265 align:middle line:84%
various positive emotions like
love, tenderness, and concern.

00:44:42.265 --> 00:44:45.520 align:middle line:90%


00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Then the flask was
replaced with another one

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and the people were
asked to project emotions

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of a different type-- fear,
aggression, and hatred.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.370 align:middle line:84%
After this, measurements
were taken on the samples.

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.600 align:middle line:84%
The water exhibited
changes that were clearly

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:90%
in one direction or another.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Love tremendously increases
energy of water and harmony

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:84%
of water, while aggression,
anger decreases and totally

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.940 align:middle line:90%
reduces harmony from water.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>>This is water
exposed to compassion.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And this, to anger.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything we feel, hear,
or see is a combination

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:36.170 align:middle line:84%
of light, sound,
electromagnetic, and many other

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.670 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Every life form, be it a
germ, an insect, animal,

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:52.220 align:middle line:84%
or human being, perceives
them differently.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.875 align:middle line:84%
They perceive them in their
own strictly defined range.

00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Only water is able to absorb
the entire range of frequencies

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:06.359 align:middle line:84%
that exist in nature and
become either living or dead

00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:07.275 align:middle line:90%
under their influence.

00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:10.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The average person
consumes 16,000 gallons

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.450 align:middle line:90%
of water in a lifetime.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
That is a vast
stream of chemical

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and structural information that
is passed through our bodies.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:84%
When we bath or
shower, we also receive

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:84%
10 times the acceptable
concentration of chlorine.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Chlorine in the water
supply displaces oxygen.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.795 align:middle line:84%
When chlorine
burns off bacteria,

00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:38.530 align:middle line:84%
it actually removes the
fire of life from water.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Water burning is oxidation
by oxygen of water.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:84%
What is the product
of this burning?

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Again water and oxygen.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't think of any
other substance which,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.830 align:middle line:90%
after burning, stays itself.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It's only water.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Because any burning is
combining oxygen with fuel.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Boiling of water is
combining oxygen with water.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The product of this burning,
again, water and oxygen.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.190 align:middle line:90%


00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Burning is a special property
of living water distinguishing

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:90%
it from dead water.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Burning is the ability to
eliminate harmful matter

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:90%
with its own power.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have studied numerous
samples of municipal water

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.165 align:middle line:84%
and did not find this
natural burning phenomenon

00:47:27.165 --> 00:47:27.940 align:middle line:90%
in any of them.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Once we tested
water in a big bottle

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.150 align:middle line:84%
labeled by producers as the
best water in the world.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And they added something
else, but this water

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.671 align:middle line:90%
had absolutely no life.

00:47:44.671 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Glass, those are silicon.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This is natural
element of the Earth.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And water interacts with
this element in our nature.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the wall of a
glass, it's smooth.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So water being
near by this wall,

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.100 align:middle line:90%
it becomes more harmonized.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So water can be kept in
glass bottle, in principle,

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.190 align:middle line:90%
infinite time.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely different.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.600 align:middle line:90%
This is plastic.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is chemicals,
and chemicals

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.930 align:middle line:90%
they penetrate water slowly.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Plus, the wall, it's not smooth.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So water being nearby
plastic surface

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:42.490 align:middle line:90%
becomes more and more chaotic.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Most likely, people do not
sense any particular difference

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:50.420 align:middle line:84%
between naturally pure and
artificially purified water.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But any animal will always
choose water from a spring,

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.730 align:middle line:84%
because this water is loaded
with natural energies.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:10%
When scientists studied this
high mountain environment

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:10%
in places where water is known
for its healing properties--

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:14.670 align:middle line:10%
like Lourdes in France-- they
made an important discovery.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.220 align:middle line:10%
They found that the pH
level of these waters

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.580 align:middle line:10%
was highly ionized
and very alkaline.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.850 align:middle line:10%
While studying
water, researchers

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:10%
exposed ordinary water to
magnetically charged plates,

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.390 align:middle line:10%
creating a simple
method of ionization,

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:33.150 align:middle line:10%
separating water into two
streams-- one alkaline

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.710 align:middle line:10%
and one acidic.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:10%
The water from the
alkaline stream

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.160 align:middle line:10%
significantly
improves hydration,

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.240 align:middle line:10%
because it is easier
for the body to absorb.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.390 align:middle line:10%
Water from tap or
bottled sources

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:49.490 align:middle line:10%
is usually clustered in groups
of 11 to 16 water molecules.

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.060 align:middle line:84%
During ionization,
the water molecules

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:57.280 align:middle line:84%
are reduced to only five to
eight molecules per cluster.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.080 align:middle line:10%
The percentage of oxygen
increases significantly,

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:10%
which can be almost double the
amount of tap or bottled water,

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.630 align:middle line:10%
allowing the body to
maintain a proper pH balance.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:10%
>>Our lifespan is directly
proportional to the amount

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.320 align:middle line:10%
of antioxidants we
have in our body.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And water is an important
carrier of antioxidants.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.730 align:middle line:84%
If you drink water that has
large quantities of hydrogen

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:24.470 align:middle line:84%
along with the right surface
tension and right mineral

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.790 align:middle line:84%
content, then it will slow
down the aging process.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It will keep our mitochondria
from dying, which provide us

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.280 align:middle line:90%
with the energy of life.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And so we can expect
to live longer.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it is
said that we should

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:41.270 align:middle line:90%
live to be about 120 years old.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And we often die
long before that.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So no one really dies
of natural causes

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.134 align:middle line:90%
if they die younger than that.

00:50:48.134 --> 00:50:51.830 align:middle line:90%
They die of dehydration.

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>What is acidic pH?

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.130 align:middle line:10%
What is acid?

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.550 align:middle line:10%
Acid is devoid of
electrons, free electrons.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.900 align:middle line:90%
What is alkali?

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Alkali is full of electrons.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So our body should
be slightly alkaline.

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:90%
What it means?

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:11.730 align:middle line:84%
It means that our body should
contain enough electrons,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:16.720 align:middle line:84%
or hydrogen atoms if you like,
which will combine with oxygen.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.290 align:middle line:84%
If we are acidic, then oxygen
flows in, flows out unused.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have fuel,
oxygen is useless.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.890 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:31.690 align:middle line:10%
>>pH is a very important
factor in overall health.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:35.160 align:middle line:10%
To stay in balance, the body
has to maintain its pH level,

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.550 align:middle line:10%
because we're continuously
generating acid wastes.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:41.760 align:middle line:10%
When we eat, nutrients are
transported to our cells

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:10%
and then burnt with oxygen,
resulting in waste products

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.680 align:middle line:10%
that are almost always acidic.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.400 align:middle line:10%
In a healthy body, our blood
would pick up these wastes

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.430 align:middle line:10%
and carry them through the
liver, kidneys, colon or skin

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.870 align:middle line:10%
before removal.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.910 align:middle line:10%
But worry, poor sleep
and food choices,

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:00.970 align:middle line:10%
and environmental challenges
limit our body's ability

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:03.440 align:middle line:10%
to remove acidic
waste quickly enough.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.640 align:middle line:10%
So the body compensates
and transforms acidic waste

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.090 align:middle line:10%
to solid waste,
storing the solid waste

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:11.380 align:middle line:10%
in less dangerous
areas like arteries,

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.930 align:middle line:10%
and especially fat tissues.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The doctor is drawing blood
from a patient's finger.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Using a special
microscope, we shall

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.580 align:middle line:84%
be able to see the condition
of her body from this drop.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>These are red blood
cells, and they've

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.960 align:middle line:90%
lost their electrical charge.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So they're all stuck together in
a formation called a rouleaux.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Here's a huge symplast.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Symplasts are associated
with heart disease

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and many other conditions that
could be coming in the future.

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The doctor asks the patient
to drink a small amount

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.720 align:middle line:90%
of structured water.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.100 align:middle line:84%
After 12 minutes, the
doctor again draws blood

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.570 align:middle line:90%
from the patient and studies it.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>So you can see that the
cells then become buoyant,

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.060 align:middle line:84%
they become slippery, and they
have their electrical charge.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.810 align:middle line:90%
So they repel each other.

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:14.590 align:middle line:84%
That allows them
to carry oxygen,

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and it means that we're
changing the pH of the blood.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that's utterly
amazing that just

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:21.802 align:middle line:90%
drinking water could do that.

00:53:21.802 --> 00:53:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>One way to
counteract over acidity

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.690 align:middle line:90%
is by drinking alkaline water.

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.420 align:middle line:84%
We can measure the
beneficial effects

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.660 align:middle line:84%
clinically with a
new technology called

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:90%
polyinterference photography.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.410 align:middle line:84%
This machine analyzes the
body using light analysis

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The subject is exposed to
controlled full spectrum light.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:52.130 align:middle line:84%
This study volunteer had
been drinking mostly soda pop

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.970 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The doctor notes
that the participant

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:84%
suffers severe congestion in
the areas around the liver,

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:90%
pancreas, and spleen.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.970 align:middle line:84%
A bright pink spot
also appears where

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the participant reports
having regular severe migraine

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:06.920 align:middle line:90%
headaches.

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The volunteer is asked to
drink only alkaline water

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.210 align:middle line:84%
for five days, and then
return for a followup exam.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The red areas where
congestion was recorded

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:84%
are now a clearer blue,
indicating that the blockages

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.850 align:middle line:90%
are shrinking in size.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The pink spot marking the
point of headaches is gone,

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and the volunteer confirms that
he hasn't suffered migraines

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:30.210 align:middle line:84%
since the drinking of
the alkaline water.

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.830 align:middle line:84%
The research team examined
the same participant

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.210 align:middle line:90%
using electrophoton imaging.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.840 align:middle line:84%
This technology, based
on the Kirlian effect,

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.560 align:middle line:84%
takes an image from
each finger using

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:84%
a high voltage electrical field
and reads its photon, or light,

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:90%
emission.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Each finger corresponds to
specific regions of the body.

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The participant's
first scan shows

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
several gaps in
his energy field,

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.700 align:middle line:90%
representing specific organs.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the weak points
indicate the pancreas

00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.150 align:middle line:90%
and liver.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.590 align:middle line:84%
After five days of
drinking alkaline water,

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.620 align:middle line:90%
these gaps are reduced.

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.830 align:middle line:84%
The case study's image is
brighter and more consistent,

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:09.720 align:middle line:84%
representing improved
health, including the areas

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.670 align:middle line:90%
of the pancreas and liver.

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Even more conclusive
proof can be seen

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.540 align:middle line:90%
using live blood cell analysis.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a blood sample taken
before the participant began

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.030 align:middle line:90%
the water experiment.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.290 align:middle line:84%
The volunteer drank a gallon
of alkaline water that day,

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and another blood sample
is taken 24 hours later.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.680 align:middle line:84%
We can see how just
drinking alkaline

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.560 align:middle line:84%
water improved the cellular
environment of his blood.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The participant continued
drinking good water

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.180 align:middle line:90%
for two months.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.590 align:middle line:84%
During that interval, he
lost a total of 20 pounds

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.140 align:middle line:90%
and gained leaner muscle mass.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.390 align:middle line:84%
One theory of how to
increase hydration of cells

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is to remove the dissolved
solids from the water using

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.940 align:middle line:90%
distillation or deionization.

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.560 align:middle line:84%
This may allow the water
molecules to more easily enter

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.630 align:middle line:90%
the cells.

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.090 align:middle line:84%
In an experiment conducted
in the Netherlands,

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:16.380 align:middle line:84%
two beakers of deionized water
are placed next to each other.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.500 align:middle line:84%
A highly electrical
potential difference

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.970 align:middle line:90%
is run through the beakers.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, the water creates a
bridge between the two beakers.

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:30.360 align:middle line:84%
This bridge can reach up to
25 millimeters in length.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.530 align:middle line:10%
When scientists recorded
the water formation

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.480 align:middle line:10%
with a thermographic
camera, they

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.550 align:middle line:10%
found the hottest part
to be in the smallest

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.180 align:middle line:10%
diameter of the
bridge and observed

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:43.660 align:middle line:10%
a transfer of heat and
material between the beakers.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:10%
>>You think when you
look at it, there

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.620 align:middle line:10%
must be a very simple
explanation to that,

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.010 align:middle line:10%
and it must be predictable and
it must be easy to calculate.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:90%
But it is not.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>One thing is certain.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.470 align:middle line:84%
This experiment cannot be
repeated with tap or bottled

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:00.280 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Only the deionized water with
very low dissolved solids

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:04.948 align:middle line:90%
can create this phenomenon.

00:57:04.948 --> 00:57:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The interaction of water
and electricity is so basic,

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's everywhere around us.

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.035 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the clouds
at a thunderstorm--

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:20.830 align:middle line:84%
it's water and
electricity-- that one

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:24.820 align:middle line:84%
might think that scientists
understand this completely.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:30.380 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that this
substance which is most common

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.400 align:middle line:90%
has 63 anomalies.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.480 align:middle line:84%
For water, every
physical property,

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.200 align:middle line:84%
every basic property
is an anomaly.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Boiling point, freezing point,
conductivity, surface tension--

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:43.660 align:middle line:90%
all anomalies.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So the question
is to which extent

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:52.140 align:middle line:84%
can this problem be solved
within the current scientific

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.090 align:middle line:90%
framework.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it is another anomaly,
because it was not predicted

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.224 align:middle line:90%
and it cannot be calculated yet.

00:58:00.224 --> 00:58:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>It is now believed there
might be a fourth phase of water

00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:08.400 align:middle line:90%
that we previously ignored.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.960 align:middle line:10%
>>We found something
odd that interfaces

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.920 align:middle line:10%
when you have a so-called water
loving or hydrophilic interface

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.590 align:middle line:10%
with water.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.423 align:middle line:10%
In other words, when
the water is butting up

00:58:17.423 --> 00:58:20.810 align:middle line:10%
against that surface,
that hydrophilic surface,

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:24.860 align:middle line:10%
it takes on a new
set of properties.

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like a liquid crystal.

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And these properties
are not like the liquid

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.660 align:middle line:90%
and not like the solid.

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.930 align:middle line:90%
They're somewhere in between.

00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:37.020 align:middle line:84%
If there's a fourth phase of
water, I think this is it.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.040 align:middle line:84%
If we had a plant
sitting here, everybody

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.540 align:middle line:84%
can understand that the light
is coming in and hitting

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.810 align:middle line:84%
the plant, and this
energy from light,

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:46.300 align:middle line:84%
from the environment,
is then changed,

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.170 align:middle line:84%
transduced into other kinds
of energy that the plant uses.

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And the water, it
does the same thing.

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Water is a recipient of energy.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.255 align:middle line:84%
Your cells are filled with
these little mini batteries.

00:58:57.255 --> 00:59:00.080 align:middle line:90%


00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Water from a single container
was divided into two portions.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:08.230 align:middle line:84%
One part was subjected
to an outside influence

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that changed the structure
and properties of that water.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.260 align:middle line:84%
The water in the second flask
acquired the same structure

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and the same properties after
a certain period of time,

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.920 align:middle line:84%
even if the two
portions of water

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.196 align:middle line:84%
were a significant distance
removed from each other.

00:59:24.196 --> 00:59:28.480 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.180 align:middle line:84%
The Russian philosopher and
scientist Alexander Chizhevsky

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.990 align:middle line:84%
as early as the 1930s described
one astounding phenomenon.

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Observing a colony
of bacteria, he

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.480 align:middle line:84%
noted that from time to time,
these quiet microorganisms were

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.220 align:middle line:90%
engaged in unusual activity.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Chizhevsky established
that single cell organisms

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.170 align:middle line:84%
became agitated in line with
the advent of solar flares.

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:54.030 align:middle line:84%
While the sunlight
still has a full eight

00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:57.000 align:middle line:84%
minutes to reach the
Earth, the bacteria already

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.750 align:middle line:90%
know about the upcoming change.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Detecting changes
in the universe,

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.120 align:middle line:84%
water immediately
changes its properties

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.100 align:middle line:84%
both on Earth and within the
bodies of living creatures.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.585 align:middle line:90%
This happens instantly.

01:00:09.585 --> 01:00:16.070 align:middle line:90%


01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.860 align:middle line:84%
In the world's religions
Christianity, Islam,

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and Judaism, it is the
practice to recite a prayer

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.595 align:middle line:84%
before taking food
or to consecrate

01:00:23.595 --> 01:00:26.590 align:middle line:84%
the food during major
religious holidays.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Why did something
that science is only

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
now trying to understand seem
obvious to our ancestors?

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>January the 18th.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the eve of the Orthodox
Feast of the Epiphany.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.116 align:middle line:84%
Two flasks are filled
with ordinary tap water.

01:00:44.116 --> 01:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Early in the
morning, one of them

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
is set inside the
Church near the vessel

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:49.789 align:middle line:84%
over which the sacrament
of sanctification

01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:50.580 align:middle line:90%
is to be performed.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.330 align:middle line:90%


01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Every year on January 19, the
faithful and even non-believers

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
hurry into churches to pick up
some of the baptismal water.

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
It is believed to possess
extraordinary properties.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.980 align:middle line:90%


01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.030 align:middle line:84%
In order to confirm
or refute this,

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
the two flasks were taken
to the laboratory for study

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:14.680 align:middle line:90%
immediately after the service.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Here the water was frozen
in a cryogenic chamber

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.544 align:middle line:84%
and photographed
under the microscope.

01:01:19.544 --> 01:01:27.740 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The crystals of the
tap water looked

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.134 align:middle line:90%
like a chaotic diffused spot.

01:01:31.134 --> 01:01:37.779 align:middle line:90%


01:01:37.779 --> 01:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
While the water that
had been in the church

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
had the rectilinear symmetrical
form of a six pointed star.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.850 align:middle line:90%


01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a
fabulous experiment

01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
done at McGill University
in Canada a few years back

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
in which the goal was
to see if water that

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
had been prayed over and
blessed would stimulate

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
the growth of young seedlings
more than plans that

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:06.644 align:middle line:84%
were watered with
water that had not

01:02:06.644 --> 01:02:07.810 align:middle line:90%
been blessed through prayer.

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:10.984 align:middle line:90%


01:02:10.984 --> 01:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, the plants
that received the water that

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
had been prayed over and blessed
had a more vigorous growth

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.220 align:middle line:90%
rate.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Over and over, we
see around the world

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
where water seems to play
a major role in healing.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.610 align:middle line:90%


01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>We know that water is
a recorder of frequency.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And we also know from a
great deal of evidence

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that thoughts
create a frequency,

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and that water is a recorder
of those frequencies.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
People are mostly water.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Food is mostly water.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Anything alive is mostly water.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So if all of these things
are picking up and embedding

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, what is
it we are thinking?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.190 align:middle line:90%


01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>From all this research, I can
give you very simple advice.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go to lunch or
dinner, please never, ever

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
sit with people who are in
aggressive mood, in a bad mood.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
They can totally
spoil your food and it

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
will have a very negative
effect on your health.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>How a person
handles water, if he

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
approaches the water with
good thoughts or blesses it

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and says thank you to it,
the quality of the water

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
will improve and the water
will have a positive effect

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.840 align:middle line:90%
on a person and his body.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.610 align:middle line:10%
>>If you go to Bible,
if you go to Rigveda,

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:45.750 align:middle line:10%
or if you go to other
sources of the origins,

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:48.475 align:middle line:10%
it turns out very interesting
thing-- water was not created.

01:03:48.475 --> 01:03:51.110 align:middle line:90%


01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
If you just read the
first verses of Genesis,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
there was not a single word
about the creation water.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:06.070 align:middle line:10%
And all other religions talk
about water as non created.

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And here is the major mystery
to which science will never

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:13.690 align:middle line:90%
give the answer.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>No matter the
faith, a person must

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
be clean to stand
before the creator.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Water is an intermediary
that connects humans

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
with their source.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The Jews have
ablutions and mikvehs.

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
The Muslims wash
before ritual prayers.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity, water is
the foundation for baptism.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
There have been many wars
based on religious grounds

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But sincere prayers
from any major religion

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
can have a positive
effect on water.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:48.150 align:middle line:10%
>>From my experience,
any positive information

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:51.300 align:middle line:10%
being given to water,
such as mantras or words

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.160 align:middle line:10%
from holy books, no matter
the religious faith,

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.692 align:middle line:10%
form beautiful crystals.

01:04:58.692 --> 01:04:59.650 align:middle line:10%
>>The Christian prayer.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:03.287 align:middle line:90%


01:05:03.287 --> 01:05:04.730 align:middle line:10%
The Buddhist prayer.

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:08.100 align:middle line:90%


01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:08.950 align:middle line:10%
The Muslim prayer.

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:11.750 align:middle line:90%


01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:16.605 align:middle line:84%
By the summer of 1991, Israel
had had no rain for two years.

01:05:16.605 --> 01:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%


01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.355 align:middle line:84%
The water in the country's only
freshwater lake, Lake Kinneret,

01:05:23.355 --> 01:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
had fallen 15 centimeters
below the critical level.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Then 10,000 Israelis
gathered at the Wailing Wall

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:34.080 align:middle line:90%
to pray for rain.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
On the third day, rain came
down on the country in torrents.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:41.957 align:middle line:84%
Many people explain this
fact as simple coincidence.

01:05:41.957 --> 01:05:56.950 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>If you had to point at
anything in the universe that

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
connects all things, the
only substance you could find

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:04.680 align:middle line:90%
would be space.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Space is everywhere.

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And water is an
expression of that space.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Any changes in the space
will change the water.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
All life emerges from
water, because water

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is the medium from which space
communicates with all living

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
things.

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
You find that you have
hurricanes and typhoons, right?

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Hurricanes in north
hemisphere and typhoons

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.050 align:middle line:90%
in the south hemisphere.

01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the way
the weather patterns move

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, they go from
the poles to the equator

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and back to the poles.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't cross over.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
There is this double
torus behavior

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
of how the water and
the electric fields

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic field of
our planet is behaving.

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So water is an expression of
the structure of space-time.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The quantum vacuum is
something able to oscillate.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
In this way, all the
existing object in nature

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
are in the same position
as the metronomes.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.080 align:middle line:10%
They settle on an
oscillating platform,

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.720 align:middle line:10%
which is the quantum vacuum.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And through the
quantum vacuum, they

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:23.350 align:middle line:10%
are able to tune together
their oscillation.

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And this says why liquid water
becomes the very good tool

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
for dialoguing, for having a
dialogue with external signal

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.930 align:middle line:90%
coming from elsewhere.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:55.860 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>>In the 13th century,
an Italian mathematician

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.250 align:middle line:10%
known as Fibonacci,
while observing

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:05.780 align:middle line:10%
various natural phenomenon,
discovered the golden ratio--

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.810 align:middle line:10%
an infinite sequence of
numbers, every one of which

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:11.690 align:middle line:10%
was the sum of the
two preceding numbers.

Dividing any of the smaller
numbers of the sequence

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:16.210 align:middle line:10%
by the neighboring
greater number,

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:22.729 align:middle line:10%
we shall always get
approximately 0.618.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:25.229 align:middle line:84%
Creating his paintings,
Leonardo da Vinci

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
used a special principle
of structural perfection.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
He called it the
golden section, where

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
the ratio of the greater part of
the section to its smaller part

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and the ratio of the whole
section to its greater part

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.410 align:middle line:90%
was equal to 0.618.

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Long before that, in
the sixth century BC,

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.029 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras the philosopher and
mathematician of ancient Greece

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:51.470 align:middle line:84%
discovered this
ratio in geometry.

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Years before that, we can find
that ancient Egyptians made

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.950 align:middle line:90%
reference to the same thing.

01:08:56.950 --> 01:09:00.689 align:middle line:84%
They called it the
Divine Essence.

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean that Pythagoras,
Fibonacci, and Leonardo da

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Vinci, as well as many
other men of genius,

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
had knowledge of
special laws of harmony

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:12.694 align:middle line:84%
which form the basis of all
things perfect in this world?

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:21.950 align:middle line:90%


01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Quite recently,
scientists put forward

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:28.680 align:middle line:84%
a new hypothesis stating
that the laws of the universe

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.660 align:middle line:90%
are written in water.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Ratio, or
the Divine Essence,

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
was found in a
molecule of meltwater.

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
In regular water, the angle
between hydrogen atoms

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.590 align:middle line:90%
varies from 104 to 107 degrees.

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
In meltwater, this
angle is 108 degrees.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And the ratio of the length
of hydrogen ties 0.618.

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a special
state of water.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
In melting from
its frozen state,

01:09:57.910 --> 01:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
water deletes all
information from its memory,

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.552 align:middle line:84%
retaining only one program:
the program for life.

01:10:04.552 --> 01:10:07.860 align:middle line:90%


01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything in
nature's perfection

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:12.310 align:middle line:84%
has been created in
accordance with this program.

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The arrangement of leaves on a
branch, the petals on a flower,

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or the thread of a spider's web.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.300 align:middle line:90%


01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
The intricate form
of a snail's shell,

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
the DNA molecule, the universe.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%


01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It transpires that who
created this world transmitted

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
the program of life to every
living creature through water.

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%


01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenon of
structural memory

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
enables water to take an
impression of everything that

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
happens around it and to connect
all living systems together.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us is a
link in an endless chain

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:02.210 align:middle line:90%
of this transfer of information.

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, each of us is
also a source of information.

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Every one of our
actions-- a thought,

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
an emotion, an uttered
word-- separates from us

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and becomes part of the overall
informational environment.

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Informational dirt is poisoning
the water, accumulating layer

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:25.190 align:middle line:90%
by layer in its memory.

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
If that process was
to continue endlessly,

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the water would lose its
ability to support life.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But it is endowed with a
self-cleansing capacity.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
This occurs at the moment
of phase transition,

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
when it evaporates and then
condenses and falls as rain.

01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Or when it melts from
its frozen state,

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.430 align:middle line:84%
shaking off the
informational grime.

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Water always
preserves its secret.

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:56.390 align:middle line:90%
That is, the program for life.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>All the information about
life is contained in water.

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
If we destroy this information,
we shall destroy ourselves.

shown that it is not

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:34.882 align:middle line:10%
just one word, but a combination
of two: love and gratitude.
