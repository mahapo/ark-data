00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys anything about that?

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.721 align:middle line:84%
-Ah, I don't--
-Never heard of it?

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.653 align:middle line:84%

We're doing a documentary

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:90%

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:90%
On what?

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:90%
On mindfulness.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Mindfulness?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's called "The
Mindfulness Movie."

RICK HANSON (VOICEOVER):
A baby that's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
born, as it were,
would not be presumed

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to be mindful necessarily.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:10%
Because mindfulness
involves this

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.375 align:middle line:10%
sustained deliberate quality.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.495 align:middle line:84%
PAUL HARRISON (VOICEOVER):
Most of the time, most of us

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:90%
are just not there.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.547 align:middle line:90%
We're mindless.

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Their mind wanders
47% of the time.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.028 align:middle line:84%
And when it does wander 47%
of the time-- We're not there.

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:26.194 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that
we're not there,

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:28.604 align:middle line:84%
because when you're not there,
you're not there to notice.

JON KABAT-ZINN: The world
is starving for something.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%

of "Time Magazine" or
"Sports Illustrated."

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But it is definitely
starving for something.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's not just the world.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:90%
We are starving for something.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
PAUL HARRISON: When
I was about 20,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
while I was sitting on my
desk, working on some problem,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I experienced what I call
a shift in perspective.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
What had seemed so elusive was
really right there front of me.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I realized that what

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I needed to do in
order to see it was

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:90%
simply to shift my perspective.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:10%
It changed my whole life.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:10%
Because for once,
I finally got it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I really got it.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
myself and I started

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:90%
to understand others better.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm Paul Harrison, an
architect and an author.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most common
questions I get asked

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
is why is an architect making
a movie about mindfulness.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's why I want to
share this story with you.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
You see, I was a typical post
hippie generation teenager

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
from the early '70s with all
that reckless and mindless

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
behavior that made us
think we were really cool.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And we loved to
challenge all the rules

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.994 align:middle line:84%
to the point of ending up with
some very serious consequences.

00:03:24.994 --> 00:03:26.027 align:middle line:90%
WOMAN (ON RADIO): Suspect down.

00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Request EMT immediately.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I realized once I
left high school that

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
was no path I wanted to stay
on and I was looking for a much

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
better way to deal
with stress, and family

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:90%
issues, college, making money.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to begin
practicing mindfulness.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And then about a
year and a half ago,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I set out on an
incredible journey

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to find the core teachings of
what mindfulness really is.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You see, when I started, I
took the street wise approach.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
subscribe any one camp,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
but rather find what that core
essence of mindfulness is.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I met with experts
like Ellen Langer

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard, who many of called
the mother of mindfulness.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I also met with Congressman
Tim Ryan, Guy Claxton

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
from England, Jeffrey Schwartz,
psychiatrist, and even world

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
renowned authors
like Dan Millman

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:90%
from the "Peaceful Warrior."

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And so my mission,
my passion, is

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to share my journey
so you can start

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:90%
learning about mindfulness.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And even more important,
to learn about yourself.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:33.584 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
ELLEN LANGER (VOICEOVER):
So all certainty creates

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
an illusion of stability.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So certainty promotes
mindlessness.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:10%
Mindlessness usually
comes about by default.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:10%
And it's not
motivated, it just it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:10%
never occurred to you that this
thing could be other things.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:10%
Mindless mode is, I think, the
mode we're on 90% of the time.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, we eat
and read the corn flakes box,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
or we eat and talk, or eat
and dream, or most of us

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:90%
eat and read.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.585 align:middle line:84%
Or we eat and watch TV.
-You get in the car.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:06.467 align:middle line:90%
You start the car.

00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:10%
Pull it out of the driveway.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:10%
You drive somewhere
for 10 or 15 minutes.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:10%
You arrive and you can't
remember how you got there.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:10%
You can take a cigarette out of
the pack, put it in your mouth,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:10%
take out the lighter, light
it, and be completely unaware.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're going how-- and you
don't remember any of that.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
daydreaming the entire time.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And even when we're
not in that mode

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're thinking
about something,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.384 align:middle line:84%
we're mindless about almost
everything else we're doing.

00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We aren't really aware
of 'em because we're

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.791 align:middle line:84%
so busy onto the next thing,
anticipating the next thing.

00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:10%
Mindfulness teachers
describe the distracted mind

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:10%
as monkey mind, a monkey
that just jumps around

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:10%
from one thing to the other.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
We'll do something
to distract ourselves.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
us the get bored.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:90%
We get preoccupied.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
We're on the computer
when we're at work.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:90%
We're just so distracted.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll put the radio on,
we'll put the TV on.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not watching it.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.807 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what channel it's on.

00:06:02.807 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we're robots and we're

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:90%
listening to this command.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.738 align:middle line:10%
And the robot can
only respond and react.

00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:16.515 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:18.115 align:middle line:84%
ROBINA COURTIN (VOICEOVER):
Mindfulness, for me,

00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
is just a technique of
identifying what's there

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and distinguishing between
the neurosis and the virtues,

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
or the good qualities.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:10%
The most common definition
is paying attention

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:10%
to present moment experience.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:10%
Mindfulness is your
natural state of being.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the awakening
of possibility

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility
of awakening.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:10%
But also, it's about just
noticing what is happening

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:10%
every moment of the day.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
Mindfulness is one thing.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It's paying attention.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
To the actions
that you are taking.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:10%
It's a sustained
quality of being present.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in the zone
and you can actually train

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:90%
your mind to be in the zone.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:10%
I call it a basic mind hygiene.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
A clear minded
observational perspective.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:90%
The experience of mindfulness--

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Is turning into
reality as it is,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%
as it unfolds simply right now.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Which is just really the
full experience of life.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Without getting lost in
thought and becoming forgetful.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are
representations of reality.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness is the
actual experience.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Is the ability to
go to color white.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness is paying
attention to the moment

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
with an open and a willingness
to let go of old patterns

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.978 align:middle line:90%
and live in the present.

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:36.954 align:middle line:90%

Uh.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Were you even watching?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Watching what?

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.981 align:middle line:84%
The experts
explaining mindfulness.

00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.725 align:middle line:84%
I was watching.
-Mm.

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:90%
What did it say?

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it-- it was
something about mindfulness.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.605 align:middle line:90%
Uh, I don't have a clue.

00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:06.266 align:middle line:84%
It's because you
weren't paying attention.

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Uh.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, I did.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I was listening to it.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, but you weren't
paying attention

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:10%
and that's the problem.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:10%
Wait.
Wait.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:10%
There's a problem?

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, there's a problem.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:10%
You don't pay attention.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't even know what
you mean because I could

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:10%
easily do two things at a time.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, you were texting
and hearing voices,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:10%
but you weren't listening.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:10%
What's the difference?

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:10%
The difference is you
were hearing voices,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.530 align:middle line:10%
but you weren't
actually listening.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:10%
It's mindless.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
All right, so tell me what
they said, if you're so smart.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It's that mindfulness
means paying

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
attention to what is actually
happening right now, not later.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
need to work on.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So you just want
me to be more aware,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
like to hear what's happened
and to pay attention

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.016 align:middle line:90%
to what's happening right now.

00:08:48.016 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%

it's just continually

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.547 align:middle line:90%
running reactive loops."

PAUL HARRISON: We
don't experience

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:90%
reality as it really as.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
We perceive it through a filter
that allows us to see only what

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:90%
we've been conditioned to see.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
That's because we've become
trapped in the neurobiology

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
of our own brain.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Just like every tree has
a unique set of branches,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
every brain has a unique pattern
of neurons and connections

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that are both genetic
and learned over time.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So each and every one of
us is wired differently.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's the neural
architecture of our brains

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that tells us who we
are and how we're going

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:90%
to act and react in the world.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Every thought we
have is the result

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
of a network of hundreds
of billions of brain cells

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:90%
called neurons.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Unlike other cells in our body,
neurons don't touch each other,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
but are separated by microscopic
spaces called synapses.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Neurons communicate
across these synapses

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
through chemical transfers that
blast from one cell to the next

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:90%
with a zap of electricity.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Messages zip around our brain
like a supersonic pinball

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:10%
Each neuron sends and
receives information

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:10%
to 50,000 other neurons
in a rapid fire production

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:10%
that all adds up to
100 billion neurons

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:10%
times 50,000 connections.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there are
more connections

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:10%
between neurons in a single
human brain than there

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:10%
are stars in our galaxy.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
The result is a
complex neural forest

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of networks that
form our personality,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:90%
our identity, and our habits.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Hardly ever do we find
trees that grow alike

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and we don't find
brains that grow alike.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
We are all unique.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:10%
While these trillions
of neuron networks

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:10%
often work in concert to create
brainstorms of creativity

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and new ideas, their
primary purpose

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:10%
is to keep each and every
one of us alive and safe

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:10%
by recognizing patterns as
they access a constantly

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:10%
changing environment.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes, things get stuck.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Who, of us, doesn't have some
form of addictive behavior

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:90%
or another?

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for a-- for
personal comfort,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:84%
or because of a desire,
or whatever is behind it,

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and changing them is very
difficult for a lot of people

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and they struggle with that.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of them are stuck
in old routines, old patterns.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we becomes
stuck in these patterns

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and live our lives
on auto pilot.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, becoming
more and more mindless

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
as we continue to view
the world through filters

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
instead of seeing things
as they really are.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
As we grow older, our
actions and reactions become

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
conditioned by our hopes,
our tensions, anxieties,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
motivations, loves,
hates, desires,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:90%
fears, or frustrations.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we analyze
before we experience.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And we filter before we see.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:10%
Explaining that in brain terms
is not hard to understand.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:10%
I've done it in a lot of my
writing, which is we have

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:10%
habits centers in our brain.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
These habit centers
in our brain,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
roughly, are shared
with reptiles.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And they are very unconscious.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So you literally do get into
behavioral loops that are your

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:90%
doing without you aware of it.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Our perception operates
increasingly like a defense

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
mechanism, trapping us in
patterns of behavior that

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
have less to do
with present reality

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.662 align:middle line:84%
and more to do with past
experience or expectations.

00:12:35.662 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But if we start changing
that neural architecture

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
through intentionally paying
attention to what's here

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
in a particular
way, then we start

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
training that
healthy reactivity,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:90%
that more adaptive reactivity.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
That can help us with
stress, anxiety, depression,

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:90%
trauma, and even addiction.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
As long as we continue to
perceive reality as we've been

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
conditioned to
perceive it, we're

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
destined to live a life
in endless reactive

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:90%
loops of conditioned responses.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness changes your
relationship with that habit

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:84%
center so that it's not
in control in anything

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:90%
like the same degree.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
By noticing the
looping that happens

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in any particular moment,
that reactive looping,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that's sending us into
these states of suffering.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you practice
mindfulness once or twice

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
daily, you'll be able to
change your brain physiology

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be able to
change your nervous system.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Even eight minutes
or more a day

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
can grow measurable
neural structure.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So anything in the brain that
is changing and being retained

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is through some kind
of neuroplasticity.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's not
rewiring major pathways.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:10%
It's changing the
subtle connectivity

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:10%
of the pathways that exist.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So neuroplasticity
changes the brain

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
from being more centered in
primary emotion, the kind

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of emotion that we share
with all the other mammals

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
to the executive
centers of the brain.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:10%
We do form new neurons,
new connections.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you practice
mindfulness,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:90%
then we develop new circuits.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Neurons that fire
together are wired together

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire
nervous system.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
They do so preferentially
for what's in the field

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:90%
of focused attention.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
The brain is more plastic, even
in adults, than people realize.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is a lot
of room for change

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:90%
in those habit loops.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't-- it
does not take that long.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So little mindfulness
practices sustained over time

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
can add up to big
changes for the better

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:90%
over the course of your life.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.665 align:middle line:90%
The brain is plastic.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And what it has
learned, it can unlearn.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So becoming mindful means
untraining our brains,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
emptying them of
preconceived patterns.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
This easily accessible ability
releases us from constraints

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and quickly changes
mindless behavior

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:90%
in to mindful behavior.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But what's more important
is that mindfulness

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:90%
actually evolves the brain.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It actually advances
the evolutionary process

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of our brain to a state
where we act in a wiser more

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
compassionate mode,
to not only ourselves,

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
but to others in our
global environment.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:10%
So I think if we
leave around 5:00 PM,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:10%
we should be there around 9-ish.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:90%
That sounds good.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Are you excited?

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting
to go for so long.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to bring anything?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Um, like what?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.762 align:middle line:90%
Like a surprise.

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:90%
A surprise?

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:90%
[PHONE RINGING]

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be
nice to get a surprise.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.085 align:middle line:84%
Well, like, if I told
you it was a surprise,

00:15:35.085 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
then it wouldn't,
like, be a surprise.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I know, but I was
just give you a

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.096 align:middle line:84%
heads up that maybe it would be
nice to get a surprise is all.

00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Why do you keep
checking your phone?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't keep checking my phone.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Sure, you do.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I pay attention to
everything you do

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and you keep checking it.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.761 align:middle line:84%
It's a bad habit and
it's completely mindless.

00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah?
Well, so what-- what if it is?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:90%
What if it's a bad habit?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I need
your full attention.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And look, now you're
getting defensive about it.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's your reactive loops like
swinging all out of control.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't even realize it.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Reactive what?

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Reactive loops.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
It's when you react to the
same thing over and over again.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you realize you're doing it?

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, now I do.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for you
pointing that out.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.586 align:middle line:84%
I realize it.
Yeah.

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:17.285 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:16:17.285 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now recent research
in cognitive science

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
has confirmed that performance
increases when we think less.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:84%
If a tennis player were to
think of a where a ball might be

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
instead of seeing where
that ball actually is,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
it would be too late
and he'd miss it.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness enables
us to respond quickly

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.243 align:middle line:84%
and effortlessly to attain peak
performance in any situation.

00:16:45.243 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Trying is a really interesting
phenomenon because to try to do

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:10%
something is to not do it.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to do things,
rather than just doing things.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:10%
If I said to somebody could
I have a glass of water

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:10%
and they said I'll try to
get you a glass of water,

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:10%
that wouldn't make much sense.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:90%
What does trying look like?

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like this.
-Try not.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
There is no trying.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:90%
Just do or do not.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:90%
Which is actually very trying.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
To be-- to be in that
state of kind of having

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
to look like you're trying.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And accept whatever
you do is fine for now.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:90%
We'll get better over time.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:90%
So don't try to do anything.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:10%
A very good example I think
is from the film "Matrix."

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:84%
There is this moment
when Morpheus and Neo

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:90%
having a kung fu sparring.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And Morpheus says don't
try to hit me and hit me.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly-- you know,
we're trying to do things,

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:90%
rather than just doing things.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness teaches
us how to do things

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:90%
without trying to do things.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
When you prepare
for an interview

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and you go into the interview
and then they ask you questions

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't
prepared for, and you're

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
sort of thrown because
you're there ready

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:90%
made with your answers.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't do a
very good job of it.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come
out of the interview

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking
down the stairs

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and you have what the
French [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, yeah, I
should have said that.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I should have-- oh, that's
what I should have done.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like then you-- then you
get your intelligence back.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Before the interview,
before you were wise,

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.594 align:middle line:84%
and afterwards you are wise, but
in between, you are otherwise.

00:18:23.594 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise means
it's like you're trying.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to
find something clever

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.315 align:middle line:84%
which you bring to the
situation and want to use.

00:18:33.315 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're
able to achieve

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
with the mindfulness training
is the best of both worlds.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
The alertness of the
central nervous system

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
without the anxiety
and the calm relaxation

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and pleasantness of the
parasympathetic system

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:90%
without the drowsiness.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So there was an
interesting study

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
where they were in the scanner,
during the same experiment,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and they were presented
with the digits

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:90%
on the screen between 1 and 9.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And they had to judge whether
the digit was odd or even.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So as you can imagine,
it's a simple task.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
think about it much.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But they noticed
in the data here,

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
brain is on fire.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
The prefrontal
cortex is engaged.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of visual
cortex is engaged.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Motor cortex is engaged.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I called it ego effort.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.305 align:middle line:84%
This person has a
very strong sense of I

00:19:23.305 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:90%
really need to do this task.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.245 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going to go for it.

00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it well.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Behaviorally, they're
performing on the same level.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple task, what we
call on the ceiling level,

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:90%
so both performing well.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But what happening with the
experienced meditator, only

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
absolutely essential bits of
the brain for the performance

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:90%
of this task.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So one is expending
a lot of energy

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.066 align:middle line:84%
to do the same task, whereas the
other one, just, you can say,

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:90%
in the state of flow.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I don't get it.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Like, I try stuff all the time.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.065 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it?

00:19:58.065 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:58.765 --> 00:19:59.722 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:19:59.722 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Try to take this pen from me.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.776 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:04.776 --> 00:20:06.805 align:middle line:84%
See, you weren't
paying attention.

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.746 align:middle line:90%
Try to take the pen from me.

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:12.702 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:12.702 --> 00:20:14.301 align:middle line:84%
See, you're not
paying attention.

00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
-Well--
-I said try to take the pen.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say take the pen.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do you mean?

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, trying is not doing.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Hold the pen.
-OK.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.051 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to take
the pen, but I'm

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:90%
not actually taking the pen.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.051 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness teaches
you to do, not try.

00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
I mean, maybe.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you'll
remember the next time

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.426 align:middle line:10%
you try to meet me on time.
-Yeah, maybe.

00:20:44.426 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:10%
The essence of mindfulness
is to observe what's there

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:10%
and what we bring
that observation to,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:10%
with the quality of being
aware of our own awareness.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Which is sort of the opposite
of being absent-minded.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like dedicating
your awareness

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:90%
to the present moment.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:10%
You're either mindful
in your whole body

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:10%
and in your interactions or
you're sleep and unconscious.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:10%
And there's nothing like
a close relationship

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:10%
to show you, to mirror, what
your unconscious patterns are.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:10%
So first step is to
just be with what's

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:10%
there, which means that all
that's there is mindfulness.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We're just aware of it.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
We're paying attention, being
present, rather than being

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:90%
distracted by so many thoughts.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:10%
If you want to
summarize it, mindfulness

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:10%
allows you to be
authentically present

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:10%
without the interference
of preoccupations

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:10%
about the past or the future.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So baby that's
born, as it were,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
would not be presumed to
be mindful necessarily.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Because mindfulness involves
this sustained deliberate

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.482 align:middle line:90%
quality of recollectiveness.

00:21:58.482 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:10%
It's the capacity of
human beings to be aware.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And our human
awareness can be focused

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:90%
in something we call attention.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So being able to be
attentive to what we're

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.590 align:middle line:84%
doing, which is the
essence of mindfulness,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly helpful.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:10%
We just are operating in an
incomplete field of awareness.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure the field of
awareness can ever be complete,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:90%
but it can be much faster.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:10%
And it makes you
mindful of these very

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:10%
fundamental physical processes.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you feel more
grounded in your own body.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you
practice mindfulness,

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
you're not only becoming
more aware of things

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that before you
weren't aware of,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
but you're developing
these skills that can allow

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.730 align:middle line:90%
you to sense the inner world.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is change.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.468 align:middle line:90%
It is the action of change.

00:22:44.468 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And we need to awaken the
mind, expand out sense of self

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to really alert our attention,
to expand our awareness.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can use mindfulness
as a process to do it.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:10%
So once you're aware of
that, you can change it.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Until you're aware of
it, you can't change it.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Cultivate some mindfulness.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Be present.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Practice being in
your body, practice

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:84%
tasting your food in a
way that is fascinated

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:90%
and absorbed and nonjudgmental.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:10%
So mindfulness is about
noticing what you're feeling,

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:10%
paying attention,
and not judging it.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:84%
By non-judgemental
the explanation is--

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't edit.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's got-- you've
got to let it come in.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:10%
So it's an awareness without
the discriminating mind,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:10%
without a mind
that is saying this

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:10%
is better than that, comparing
without the comparing mind.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:10%
So it's good to notice
when our mind is wandering

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:10%
and be able to take note
of it without judgment,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:10%
and be curious about
what's on the mind,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:10%
and gently bring it back.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So pay attention with a
curious, receptive perspective,

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to see new aspects
and angles in everyday events.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Mm, why?

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I want
to test something.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.055 align:middle line:90%
You feel anything?

00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to feel?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Learning what I already knew.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:90%
What's-- what's that?

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:84%
That you're completely unaware
of everything around you.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Woo, what makes you so special?

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Big deal.
-Yeah, really.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:10%
Why don't you test me?
Go ahead.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.153 align:middle line:84%
-All right, I will test you.
-OK.

00:24:27.153 --> 00:24:27.932 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:27.932 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Waving your hands
in front of my face.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because you're
obviously cheating.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.427 align:middle line:84%
I'm not.
I'm not cheating.

00:24:34.427 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're looking.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Do something else.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Four fingers in
front of my face.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.062 align:middle line:10%
Mm, three fingers.

00:24:46.062 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:10%
Oh, come on, make it harder.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.739 align:middle line:10%
Your hands are above my head.
-What?

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:10%
How are you doing that?

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm completely aware.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't you want to be aware?

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then start paying
attention to the little things

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:90%
around you by being mindful.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.622 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'll try.

00:25:01.622 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
-No, there's no try, remember?
-Oh, yeah, right.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about that.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
JEFFREY M. SCHWARTZ (VOICEOVER):
You are not your brain

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.604 align:middle line:90%
means you are not your thought.

00:25:14.604 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:84%
What happens during
mindfulness practice

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is that people are
less likely to be,

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:84%
as it were, constantly
stressed, rushed off their feet.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:10%
But also, they're
less likely to respond

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:10%
to their own negative thinking.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But the first step
is to stop and be

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:90%
aware of your emotional state.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that
you have thought,

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
but you aren't your
thoughts, that you don't have

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to identify with the
voice that's producing

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:90%
thoughts in your mind.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
That thought that's coming
in, I mean, that is not you.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a production of your
habits, of your experience,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
but it's a commentary
on your experience.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:90%
It isn't your experience.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.687 align:middle line:84%
It's like mistaking
the menu for the meal

00:25:57.687 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to eat.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So your emotional
states are recognized

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
as being emotional
states, not who you are.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're always passing,
they're always in flux.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:84%
It's happy, and sad,
and angry, and fearful.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Mindful awareness is like
this vast sky, where problems

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and concerns and issues are
like these little passing

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:84%
clouds or thoughts that
just pass through your mind.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.913 align:middle line:90%
Look at that thought.

00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:25.302 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you mean my thought?

00:26:25.302 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's from last night.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's actually--
I was mad last night,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
so that's like one
angry little thought.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But don't judge it.
Just look at it.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
judge your thoughts,

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.322 align:middle line:84%
then you're engaging in it,
and then it just upsets you.

00:26:42.322 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I actually
got pretty upset,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:90%
like watching my thoughts.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, don't be upset, OK?

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain this to you.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, if my hand
is the thought, OK?

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
The space in between
is the awareness.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't focus on my hand,
focus on the awareness.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
When you're mindful of
it, then you feel better.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.221 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that's actually
pretty awesome.

00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:10%
You know, like when
you're mindless,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:10%
then your brain
doesn't understand it.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:10%
But if you're mindful,
your brain gets it.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:10%
You just need to
change your brain.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:10%
Well, what's wrong
with the one I have?

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:10%
Where do I start?

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.271 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah, that's real funny.

00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, at least you're
starting to get it.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I mean, I am.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So mindfulness can get you
out of these reactive loops

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and change the
structure of your brain.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:84%
FRED ALAN WOLF (VOICEOVER):
"Remember what you did bad

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
or did on mindfully and
try to bring mindfulness

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
into it the next time a
similar action in your life

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:10%
It's really hard to
say all of a sudden,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to be
fearful or anxious

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:10%
or depressed or whatever today.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:10%
You can't just tell yourself
and it goes away, right?

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't need
shrinks and mindfulness

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.411 align:middle line:84%
and all these other things
if that's the way it worked.

00:27:53.411 --> 00:27:54.110 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to get in
touch with this idea of choice,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:90%
what I call a choice point.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You can choose what
you want to do with it.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you want
to relate to life?

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:84%
You're not-- you
don't need to be

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
enslaved by the automatic
reactions that are there.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness tries to get
control of it, but it's hard.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And basically what we have to do
is we observe ourselves acting

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way,
and then we try

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to put in checks and balances
in our brains that let us cope

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.730 align:middle line:84%
with those reactions
when they are occurring,

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.760 align:middle line:84%
rather than preventing them from
occurring in the first place.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the hard part,
preventing them from occurring.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:10%
You are choosing to shift
your center of identification

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:10%
from the stream to the watcher.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness can give you
better control over your--

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
not only your cortex, but
your ability of your cortex

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to control the other
parts of your brain.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Why would one choose
self-limitation when you

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.027 align:middle line:90%
can be more free, more open?

00:28:53.027 --> 00:28:55.829 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.829 --> 00:28:56.763 align:middle line:10%
Wait a minute.

00:28:56.763 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing?

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm calling you out.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:10%
Calling me out?

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I'm sick of you thinking
you're so much better than me.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:10%
Mindfulness this isn't
about being better.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.132 align:middle line:10%
Oh, there you go again with
that little mindfulness talk.

00:29:09.132 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:84%
All right, if this
is how you want it,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.175 align:middle line:90%
then I'm going to show you.

00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:13.715 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm calling you out.

00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:17.285 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.285 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:10%
It didn't have to be
this way, you know.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:84%
If you stopped thinking
you were better than me,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't even have to do this.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't you get it?

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
You have them both,
mindful and mindless.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:10%
It's part of the same coin.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying you've got
both side of the coin.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:10%
What's all this coin talk?

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.396 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying you get to choose
which one you use-- be mindful

00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:10%
or being mindless.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:10%
You have both parts to you.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:10%
But I thought I always
had to be mindful.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:10%
MINDFUL: Not at all.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:10%
Look, every day, when
you're doing your routine,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.060 align:middle line:10%
you're using the mindless side
because you're used to it.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:10%
It's a routine, so you just
go through the motions.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:10%
But what happens is,
over time, you tend

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:10%
to do that for your whole life.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:10%
So you need to be mindful
of other parts of your life,

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:10%
so that you're not
mindless all the time.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:10%
So does this mean I
can't call you out?

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:10%
But if you really want to,
we'll do it this one time

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:10%
and it can be our
mindless moment together.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:10%
All right.
Are you ready?

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Are you ready?

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I'm ready.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:10%
All right, bring it.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.746 align:middle line:90%
Ow.

00:30:21.746 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:10%
Man, I'm hit, and you-- you
didn't even draw your gun.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:10%
You didn't even get hit.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.651 align:middle line:10%
You're not even
paying attention.

00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:10%
See?

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:10%
When you're mindful, you'll
start realizing these things.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.614 align:middle line:10%
So start practicing.

00:30:35.614 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll practice just for you.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
ELLEN LANGER (VOICEOVER):
Mindfulness, as I study it,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
it's the very simple process
of noticing new things.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:10%
And as you notice new things,
several things happen.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:10%
The first is that you come
to see you didn't know it

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:10%
as well as you thought you did.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like pulling back the
curtain on the "Wizard of Oz,"

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and we see what's really.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And this act of noticing is
the essence of engagement.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:10%
It just opens
you up to becoming

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:10%
aware of things that
were there before

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:10%
but were not in awareness.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what you notice.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
The things you notice can be
silly, but just the noticing

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:84%
breaks down the
boundary between you

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.965 align:middle line:90%
and that which is being noticed.

00:31:15.965 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, everything that's old
becomes new again, in some

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:84%
sense, and becomes
naturally interesting.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And life becomes
a bit less serious

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and we become-- we take
ourselves less seriously.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So you're more energetic when
you're doing this, not less so.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:90%
The neurons are firing.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the earliest work we
did, when we taught people

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to be mindful in
nursing homes, we

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:90%
found that they lived longer.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So really, our only choice
is are we paying attention

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.425 align:middle line:90%
or are we not.

00:31:43.425 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And in even at that,
some people will pay

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.430 align:middle line:90%
attention better than others.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.090 align:middle line:90%
About what?

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm looking.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.199 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking.
What?

00:31:55.199 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Are you blind?

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.410 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to see?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.930 align:middle line:90%
My new hair.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:90%
That's new hair.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.631 align:middle line:84%
You're just being mindless
again, not noticing new things.

00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know what?
Well, whoop-dee-doo, OK?

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:90%
So I don't notice things.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, you need to be more
mindful so you can notice

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.490 align:middle line:84%
new things and pay
attention, therefore,

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.210 align:middle line:90%
paying better attention to me.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, yeah, I got it.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you get it?

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.438 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I got it.

00:32:23.438 --> 00:32:24.138 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:24.138 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:10%
We're beginning to drill down
through mindfulness practice

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:10%
into the core question
of psychology,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:10%
like who the hell are we
in the first place, what

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:10%
does it-- what is the self?

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what the study of
psychology is all about.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:84%
The term ego gets a bad rep,
but it was meant neutral.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
By Freud, for example, he drew
on the original Latin and Greek

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
roots to use the
word ego meaning Ich,

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or I. It simply is a
self-identification.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.820 align:middle line:10%
It's ego, whether it's a hyper
inflated-- the best person--

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:10%
best speaker in the world,
or I'm the worst in the world

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:10%
and people aren't
going to like me.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Both of those are ego driven.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.620 align:middle line:84%
When someone says
you have a huge ego,

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that's not normally
considered a compliment.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:10%
An individual person's
identity, that's not a problem.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:10%
Egotism, concern about
one's self and concern

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:10%
about how the outcome
of your performance

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:10%
is going to reflect on your
feelings about yourself

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and what other people
will think of you,

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:10%
all of that complication,
that is what gets in the way.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:10%
But I think we
have the possibility

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:10%
to evolve culturally
to understand

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:10%
the neurobiology
of a separate cell

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:10%
and how it is in
fact a delusion.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.855 align:middle line:84%
So the conscious
self is not in charge.

00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:90%
It's here to learn.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the function

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:90%
what we need for this lifetime.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So much in modern culture
promotes competition

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of self as separate.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:84%
These are culturally
learned delusions.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, they're
not only making

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:84%
people have
meaningless lives and

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.449 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy physiological states,
but it's destroying our planet.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness is an invitation to
actually experience in reality

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:90%
how interconnected we are.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get joy
from your accomplishments.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.929 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the kind of
world we need to push for.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example, people
that are in institutions where

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:84%
they're chronically depressed,
if you listen to them as they

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
talk, every third word is
I. I'm not feeling this,

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling-- I'm
feeling terrible.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:10%
I-- I did-- I'm guilty,
I'm bad, I did this,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:10%
I did that, I, I, I, I, I, I,
I. I is like the color white.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:10%
It has no color.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:10%
You color it red, blue, green
with a feeling that represents

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.840 align:middle line:10%
the personality that you feel
is the correct personality

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:10%
for that action.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you may have gotten
this from observing

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:84%
your parents or other
parental figures

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.820 align:middle line:84%
or friends or whatever who
adapt similar types of colorings

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to their I word
when they're having

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
a certain emotional
response to a situation.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.725 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness is the ability
to go to color white.

00:35:15.725 --> 00:35:27.605 align:middle line:90%


00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Um, I think I, like,
want you to teach me how

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:90%
to become, like, more mindful.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because,
like, the other day,

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I just had, like,
this little incident,

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:90%
where I wasn't mindful.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind
of a long story,

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.825 align:middle line:84%
but basically, like, I was
just on my phone, like texting,

00:35:44.825 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
crossing the street.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew,
like, this big bus showed

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.930 align:middle line:90%
up and almost ran me over.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.541 align:middle line:84%
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
-Uh, yeah.
-Almost died.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.221 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna get
yourself killed, dude.

00:35:55.221 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- that's why I turned
to you to become more mindful.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think you're
already being more mindful.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.744 align:middle line:84%
This is a step in
the right direction.

00:36:03.744 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Right.
I see it.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Let me show you.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.900 align:middle line:84%
This is-- this is you
with mindlessness, OK?

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
This is your space,
the awareness,

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:84%
this tiny little space.
-OK.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.651 align:middle line:84%
This is your awareness
with mindfulness.

00:36:17.651 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-OK?

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Mindlessness.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness.
-Mhm.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Mindlessness.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Mindfulness.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You see how you have
more awareness to learn

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:90%
about your surroundings.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:90%
You end up seeing a bus.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:90%

[TIRES SCREECHING]

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.706 align:middle line:84%
Mindlessness.
-Wow.

00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:10%
That bus would
have ran you over.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.149 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, yeah.
-OK?

00:36:38.149 --> 00:36:39.271 align:middle line:84%
You get it?
Got it?

00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Good?
-Yes, I get it, got it, good.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Get it, got it, good.
-All right.

00:36:46.927 --> 00:36:48.160 align:middle line:84%
PAUL HARRISON
(VOICEOVER): Mark Twain

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.160 align:middle line:84%
once said I've had many troubles
in my life, most of which

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.520 align:middle line:90%
never happened.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Stress makes all kinds of
physical ailments worse.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot about what is
distressing about physical

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.215 align:middle line:10%
illness, whether you're
talking about pain

00:37:04.215 --> 00:37:09.430 align:middle line:10%
or whether you're talking about
any kind of debilitating state,

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.250 align:middle line:10%
fatigue, what makes it
worse is how we process

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:10%
it centrally in our brain.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So I feel myself
getting anxious.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:84%
One of those unconscious
systems has been triggered.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So you now say, OK, I can't
stop it, so what can I do.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I can breathe.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.960 align:middle line:90%
Take in the air.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:84%
That trick kicks on the
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:84%
which counteracts the
sympathetic, which is the fight

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
flight system, and kind of slows
everything down a little bit.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:10%
And so when we change
the system that's here,

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.020 align:middle line:10%
the stress cycle between
our thoughts that come up,

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.190 align:middle line:10%
so our thoughts-- an event
happens and we immediately

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:10%
perceive something as scary or
we need to do something about,

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:10%
something that's urgent
or it's important,

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:10%
our brain creates a snap
judgment of it being good,

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.510 align:middle line:10%
bad, right, wrong,
fair, or unfair,

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:10%
and goes into a reactive mode.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.880 align:middle line:84%
As the great stress
researcher Hans Selye put it,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
"It's not stress that kills us,
it's our reaction to stress."

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Stress is a function
not of events,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
but the view you
take of the event.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.340 align:middle line:84%
If you open up that
view in multiple ways,

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:90%
it becomes less stressful.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:84%
What we can help is how
we respond to stress.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why breathing
works so well.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it-- it reduces
the stress in the brain.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It reduces the drive from
the sympathetic system

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
that makes you-- that's
releasing adrenaline.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:10%
When you get a
call from somebody

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:10%
and you're really stressed out
and you just take the call,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.844 align:middle line:10%
you're like, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, OK, OK,

00:38:34.844 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:10%
you know.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.740 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll call
you back, you know.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you're calm and
you're not stressed out,

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you take the call and
you take your time.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And you recognize that
this is important to you

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.110 align:middle line:90%
or to the other person.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.900 align:middle line:84%
With the less
time for reflection

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have nowadays
with so much attention

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to technology filling
the spaces of our day,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
we don't really have a lot
of time for reflection.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.855 align:middle line:84%
Can you give yourself
three minutes?

00:38:57.855 --> 00:38:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you care enough
about yourself

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to give yourself three minutes,
maybe minute in the morning,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.090 align:middle line:84%
then in the afternoon, minute
in the evening to just sit

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and be present with your breath.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
If we believe we can do
it, we're going to be more

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.457 align:middle line:90%
motivated to actually do it.

00:39:10.457 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%
If we don't believe
we can do something,

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
we're not going
to actually do it.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:84%
The things we
can't do right now,

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.940 align:middle line:90%
we can learn to do tomorrow.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.040 align:middle line:84%
When we realize that
there's no outcome

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.950 align:middle line:84%
we must have, that all of
this leads us just to be more

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.897 align:middle line:84%
at peace, easier, less
reason for us to need to hit

00:39:28.897 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:90%
somebody else over the head.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And mindfulness actually
reduces the risk of depression

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:38.700 align:middle line:10%
by half in people who are the
most current depressed people,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:10%
with three or more episodes,
that many other treatments have

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.500 align:middle line:10%
failed to treat.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.870 align:middle line:84%
We also know that it's as
good as antidepressants

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:middle line:90%
in doing that.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing that we
didn't know eight years ago

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:90%
is is that repeatable.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:10%
And we found it is
repeatable, both in our lab

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:10%
and in labs around the world,
in lots of different countries,

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:59.160 align:middle line:10%
have found the same result.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The simple shift of perspective
can change your relationship

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:84%
to the problem when you
take a second look at it

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.880 align:middle line:90%
with a mindful manner.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, man, what's
happening to me?

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:90%
You're out of focus.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.700 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe if you were
a little more mindful,

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.600 align:middle line:90%
these things wouldn't happen.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Uh, what should I do?

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.725 align:middle line:10%
Try some finger tracing.

00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:22.880 align:middle line:10%
What the-- what the
heck's finger tracing?

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.336 align:middle line:10%
OK, watch me.
Watch me, OK?

00:40:24.336 --> 00:40:25.035 align:middle line:90%
MINDLESS: OK.

00:40:25.035 --> 00:40:26.455 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going
to take your finger

00:40:26.455 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and very slowly go like this
and see each nook and cranny.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Focus very slowly.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.100 align:middle line:90%
So you mean like this?

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no, that's
too fast and mindless.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to focus like that.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, very slowly.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Watch it.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, so you mean slow like this.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:90%
I really like this.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm getting into
the groove of it, like--

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Keep focusing, not bad.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.155 align:middle line:90%
I can feel a difference.

00:41:01.155 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, see, it's not so hard.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is like--
this is very nice.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to go home and
just get busy finger tracing.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness enables you
to get value for money

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:90%
out of your food, right?

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.240 align:middle line:90%
You taste it.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.740 align:middle line:90%
You're more present.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.390 align:middle line:10%
Oh, mindless eating brought me
into mindful eating, actually.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.040 align:middle line:10%
I had a-- I never met a box
of cookies I didn't like.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of eating
absent-mindedly,

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.660 align:middle line:84%
you know, going to a
restaurant, spend 25 pounds

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:84%
for a filet steak, de-da, de-da,
de-da, and then not noticing

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
yourself eating
it because you're

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:84%
busy having an
earnest conversation

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:84%
with your friend about your
relationship with your mother.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like you just
wasted 25 quid.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And mindful eating
actually helps people

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:90%
broaden their view of food.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So when I crunch into
an apple and somebody

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:84%
says why are you making
that loud crunching noise,

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:84%
it's bothering me, I think
of my grandmother being

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:90%
unable to crunch an apple.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And I say, wow, I'm just
enjoying every bite.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Usually, whenever I
eat, whether it's just

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
noticing the food, smelling
the food, tasting the food,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe slowing down a little
bit as I'm eating the food,

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.605 align:middle line:84%
what I find is if my
hunger is really high,

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:22.585 align:middle line:84%
if my hunger is in the
7 to 10 range, which

00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is the extreme hunger, and I've
waited and haven't attended

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to my earlier hunger
signals, then I am prone,

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:84%
like everybody is, I
think, to mindless eating.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:84%
If we all used our brains in
more energy efficient ways,

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:90%
you don't eat as much.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And you feel much
more energized when

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:46.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't spend all this
metabolic energy on ego

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:90%
related process, on chatter.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So at a very basic level,
mindfulness enables you

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to kind of, you know,
you taste your experience

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:90%
more vividly or more richly.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:50.901 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.901 --> 00:43:52.310 align:middle line:84%
-What?
-How's your food?

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.546 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:43:53.546 --> 00:43:55.500 align:middle line:84%
-Hm, you sure?
-Yeah.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not even tasting it.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:90%
I like it a lot.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I tasted it.
-No.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.582 align:middle line:84%
Stop what you're doing and pay
attention to eating your food.

00:44:04.582 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.770 align:middle line:90%
MINDFUL: Take this out.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.469 align:middle line:84%
OK.
Ow.

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And pay attention to
what you're eating.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.030 align:middle line:90%
MINDLESS: OK.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.220 align:middle line:84%
-Chew it slowly.
-I see.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Really taste it.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Like this?

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:90%
MINDFUL: Slowly eat it.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Really take it in.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:90%
MINDFUL: OK?

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Taste it, take it in,
and smell it, you know?

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Really taste it.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.020 align:middle line:10%
I got to get another
grape to smell it.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, get in there.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Really get into your food.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I smell it.
Smells like

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.011 align:middle line:90%
OK, just take up one bite.

00:44:37.011 --> 00:44:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So juicy in the middle.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.115 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the difference
when you're mindful?

00:44:43.115 --> 00:44:43.814 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:84%
When you're mindful and
you're in the moment?

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.220 align:middle line:84%
-How much better it is.
-Yeah.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's like
really delicious.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.260 align:middle line:84%
MINDFUL: Right, well,
because it's more delicious,

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.190 align:middle line:90%
because you're being mindful.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:55.355 align:middle line:90%
That's good stuff.

00:44:55.355 --> 00:45:02.145 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.145 --> 00:45:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness has not only become
increasingly popular practice

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in schools around the
world, but the US military

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.360 align:middle line:84%
has begun to incorporate
it into their centers

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.720 align:middle line:84%
in an effort to help
veterans and active duty

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.830 align:middle line:84%
soldiers overcome
some of the issues

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:18.665 align:middle line:84%
that they deal with, such as
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:45:18.665 --> 00:45:20.910 align:middle line:90%
or PTSD.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I recently met with Dr. Jackie
Maury, senior scientist project

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.640 align:middle line:84%
director at USC Institute
for Creative Technologies,

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Valerie Rice,
the chief of the Army

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Research Laboratory
Field Element

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:90%
at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the largest army medical
training facility in the world.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's stay take a look at
how this all came about.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.080 align:middle line:84%
It was about the same time
that the troops were returning

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:84%
from the conflicts overseas
and we were beginning

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to realize there
were some pretty

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:54.150 align:middle line:84%
big issues with PTSD or other
psychological health issues.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I was in combat arms.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I was doing the Vietnam era.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they taught you
how to be aggressive.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.880 align:middle line:84%
You are scanning all
the time and you never

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
let anybody know what's
going on with you because you

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:90%
lose your essence of surprise.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:15.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you hurt, so what?

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Mission is first.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't want people
to think you're weak,

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.430 align:middle line:90%
especially if you're a leader.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:84%
A chain is only as strong
as the weakest link.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't want
to be that link.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.445 align:middle line:84%
Because if you was that
link, you was finished.

00:46:32.445 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:84%
If you were in battle, you've
already got enough enemies.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then having your own
emotions to be another one?

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- it's tougher.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.900 align:middle line:84%
You just want to do
what you're told to do

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to
reach out and ask for help.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.770 align:middle line:84%
To go-- to go to
behavioral health

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.435 align:middle line:90%
was-- uh, you're not a man.

00:46:55.435 --> 00:46:58.430 align:middle line:90%
You ain't no soldier type thing.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Any activity with
mental health was

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.330 align:middle line:84%
subject to medical discharge
or disciplinary discharge.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:08.610 align:middle line:90%
You just didn't.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.510 align:middle line:90%
That simple.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So that prevented
a lot of soldiers,

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.740 align:middle line:84%
especially young soldiers,
from going, getting treatment.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You just don't bother to tell
people because even not being

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:84%
able to keep your personal
life in control-- in control

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.990 align:middle line:90%
is perceived as weakness.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:28.110 align:middle line:84%
As time went by and I
got involved with the VA,

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I found out that
it was acceptable,

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.450 align:middle line:84%
but I did it after I
got out of the service

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.985 align:middle line:84%
because it just was not
acceptable at that point

00:47:35.985 --> 00:47:37.060 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:90%
There's still stigma.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's still stigma to go
into behavioral health center.

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And so for those individuals who
simply wouldn't go because it

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.470 align:middle line:84%
is behavioral health, then
we can offer something

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.700 align:middle line:84%
like this that's over
a virtual world, where

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.550 align:middle line:84%
they can be, if they
choose to be, anonymous.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
PAUL HARRISON (VOICEOVER):
Dr. Steven Hickman and Alan

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Goldstein both teach mindfulness
in the form of life mindfulness

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.170 align:middle line:84%
based stress reduction
through the virtual world

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.860 align:middle line:90%
of Second Life to veterans.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So we were approached,
really out of the blue,

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.490 align:middle line:84%
by the folks at ICT
saying we're looking

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:84%
for experts in mindfulness
based stress reduction.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We got the idea to use
a virtual world as sort

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.850 align:middle line:84%
of a place of
relaxation for veterans

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:20.490 align:middle line:84%
and we found
experts who are very

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:21.980 align:middle line:90%
interested in working with us.

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they told us this
amazing project that they've

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%
been working for quite
some time in providing

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.370 align:middle line:84%
virtual reality and
virtual world training

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:90%
in various military settings.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And we had done a small
village-- and a rocky village

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:38.240 align:middle line:84%
as a proof of
concept for something

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.490 align:middle line:90%
else in the virtual world.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I took one of those veterans
over to see this village.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.540 align:middle line:84%
He didn't last 10
seconds in the desert.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.020 align:middle line:90%
He teleported out.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.300 align:middle line:90%
He said I can't handle this.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:90%
It's too real.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was the impetus for
doing something that looks

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:84%
like a hunting
lodge, a ski lodge,

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.940 align:middle line:84%
something that's very
mountainous and green with lots

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.940 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And we factor that into
the design of the world

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:90%
that we made for them.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we first
started this study

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and we had the
computers issued to us,

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.170 align:middle line:84%
it was amazing, and
cool, and exciting.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you pick
your own animated body

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
learn how to fly

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.180 align:middle line:90%
and they teach us how to walk.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was all
really very exciting.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can choose
different worlds

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to go to, and listen, and
see, and just interact

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.480 align:middle line:90%
online in an amazing way.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
at whether or not

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.080 align:middle line:84%
teaching mindfulness improves
those areas, both for veterans

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.390 align:middle line:90%
and for active duty.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And you might
need just something

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:42.620 align:middle line:84%
as simple as learning
mindfulness strategies

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.370 align:middle line:90%
and techniques.

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:48.090 align:middle line:84%
If we can intervene with some
of this and make a palatable

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:84%
activity, something
that is a tool rather

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.520 align:middle line:90%
than something mysterious--

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Which, again,
makes the whole idea

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of being an avatar
kind of attractive,

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:84%
plus you can look however
you feel like looking,

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:90%
if you want to take time.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.240 align:middle line:84%
For us, it was this whole
novel idea of something

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that we've been teaching
them really involves face

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:12.090 align:middle line:84%
to face contact in our
minds, and this idea

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of doing this in a virtual
world where all of us

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.570 align:middle line:84%
is represented by
an avatar provides

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:17.700 align:middle line:90%
this great opportunity.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So that we're not actually
physically there in that world.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:84%
There's this being
that we get to create.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:84%
We can dress the way we want,
we can shape the way we want.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
perhaps anxiety about being

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.630 align:middle line:84%
in a social setting
can still sort of

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.990 align:middle line:84%
be in a virtual
social setting where

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:35.900 align:middle line:84%
they're still in the
safety of their own home.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.790 align:middle line:84%
We would navigate our
avatar online figures

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to the designated
location in a pavilion.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Our voices would come through
the headsets and the headphones

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and we would just interact
online in a group forum.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's great
about it, for veterans,

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is even if they're
in rural areas,

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.990 align:middle line:90%
they can come together here.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:58.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be
able to go to a center.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:00.540 align:middle line:84%
People can be physically
anywhere in the world,

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.900 align:middle line:84%
but can still appear in
Second Life in our classroom.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I think some people were
afraid they might even cry

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.855 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want to
cry in front of the group.

00:51:08.855 --> 00:51:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you're online,
you can cry all you want.

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:16.344 align:middle line:84%
Participating online,
that was very--

00:51:16.344 --> 00:51:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I found it very,
very good because we

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:23.450 align:middle line:84%
everybody interacted
with one another.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And we did share a lot of
information about each other.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of my best moments that
I've learned how to relax

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.920 align:middle line:90%
is because of this course.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But that class taught
me that I do matter

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:45.992 align:middle line:84%
and I have to get
myself in order,

00:51:45.992 --> 00:51:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to not only help me,
but help my-- my folks,

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:90%
my friend, my family members.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.510 align:middle line:84%
That does apply to
all walks of life.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not just
from military stressors.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It's common everyday things
that people are going through.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.710 align:middle line:84%
No matter what your scenario,
if you want to feel better,

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:04.780 align:middle line:84%
do better, then don't let
your life pass you by.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Be a part of your life.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Slow things down, pay
attention to what's going on.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.450 align:middle line:84%
The program, it
just actually makes

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.320 align:middle line:90%
you aware of your surroundings.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying life a lot more,
the simple things in life,

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:19.520 align:middle line:84%
like, you know, my
chihuahua sleeping

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.950 align:middle line:84%
on my foot, whereas,
before, I might not

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.860 align:middle line:84%
have realized how she
felt or how comforting

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.240 align:middle line:90%
that was for her to be there.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I can kind of be a
little bit more mindful

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.470 align:middle line:84%
of the pleasure that she
obtains from me and the pleasure

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that I obtain from
just being around her.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I really sit back
now just take my time.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Sit outside, drink some
tea, listen to the wind blow

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:48.780 align:middle line:84%
through the trees,
listen to the birds,

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.530 align:middle line:84%
count the cars, how many
color cars or whatever,

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:84%
like I used to do
when I was a kid.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And I just feel great.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:53:00.036 align:middle line:84%
If I'm more relaxed, and if
I'm OK, then people around me

00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:03.340 align:middle line:84%
are probably going to
be more relaxed and OK.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just immediately
getting upset when something

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:08.400 align:middle line:84%
irritates you, you
might think, OK, well,

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.750 align:middle line:84%
maybe this person does have
something going on, whereas,

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:12.715 align:middle line:84%
before, you wouldn't--
you would just get mad

00:53:12.715 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and call that individual
a name or, you know,

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:90%
just swear or something.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
habits are bad.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Losing your temper in traffic,
getting yourself riled up.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:26.440 align:middle line:84%
He run on my bumper, horsed
around in front of me,

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and turned right in front of
me again, and turned right

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:90%
there, right in front of me.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, he could
have waited two seconds.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:34.880 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't have
been, you know, going

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.630 align:middle line:84%
through this
mindfulness class, I'm

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:39.630 align:middle line:84%
not going to tell you what I
would have done because I don't

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:40.960 align:middle line:90%
want to incriminate myself.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just
becoming in touch with myself

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:90%
and realizing who I am.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of that, be calmer,

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.680 align:middle line:84%
feel better, have
less pain, have

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:90%
less anxiety, less depression.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness it just makes me
think of how everything is,

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:90%
how everything actually is.

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:07.942 align:middle line:84%
For example, we do-- we had
to do a eating exercise.

00:54:07.942 --> 00:54:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And being in the
military, we usually

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.125 align:middle line:84%
eat-- you know, eat
quick because we always

00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:14.120 align:middle line:90%
have something else to do.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I wolf my food down
because of habit.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Military, you know.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I had never really
taken time to what

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I call savor the food that
I really-- that I eat,

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:90%
that I consume.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's still, right
now, a struggle for me,

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.140 align:middle line:90%
to sit and enjoy a meal.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Doing this mindful
exercise I got to be

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:39.760 align:middle line:90%
able to actually taste it.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:44.356 align:middle line:84%
I found out that all my
taste buds do work, you know.

00:54:44.356 --> 00:54:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And food is delicious
if you take to eat it.

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And slow down and
actually taste what you eat

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.780 align:middle line:90%
is a challenge to me.

00:54:54.780 --> 00:55:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But now I take time to connect
with myself and my thoughts

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.656 align:middle line:90%
and just to be OK with me.

00:55:02.656 --> 00:55:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
mindfulness is to me.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.340 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's slow motion.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.960 align:middle line:84%
It is my choice to slow
things down, to take a breath,

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to snap it all back
into perspective.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:16.970 align:middle line:84%
It makes me-- or, well,
or it invites me to slow

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:21.540 align:middle line:90%
down, Concentrate on self.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I've learned
structural activity,

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.740 align:middle line:90%
which was important to have.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I never considered
walking meditation.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.653 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was walking--
when outside of this building,

00:55:34.653 --> 00:55:40.105 align:middle line:84%
and I just was
free, feeling like I

00:55:40.105 --> 00:55:41.170 align:middle line:90%
was, you know, just free.

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any problems.

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that makes this
different from regular walking

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:49.030 align:middle line:84%
is that your focus
is desperately

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:53.250 align:middle line:84%
on the slowest motion of
steps that you can take.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:54.020 align:middle line:90%
You just walk.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you pay
attention to where you're going,

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.230 align:middle line:90%
but you tune everything out.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like slow
motion, which, to me, is most

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.580 align:middle line:84%
of what mindfulness
represents, putting

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.967 align:middle line:90%
everything in slow motion.

00:56:04.967 --> 00:56:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can really,
really relax.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It does take
every bit of focus,

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.637 align:middle line:84%
so you're not thinking
about the past,

00:56:13.637 --> 00:56:14.870 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking
about the future.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.730 align:middle line:84%
You're just thinking, wow, this
is a neat experience, to walk.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:30.330 align:middle line:90%


00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:32.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy being
a teenager these days.

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The constant pressure of
fitting in, growing up, going

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:37.620 align:middle line:84%
through puberty, and keeping
up with the world that moves

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:41.380 align:middle line:84%
faster than ever before
can adversely affect

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the mind of the adolescent.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:44.630 align:middle line:84%
The Mindfulness
in Schools Project

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:47.570 align:middle line:84%
was created when some
teaching colleagues

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and I shared an
ambition to bring

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.860 align:middle line:84%
together two things that were
really close to our hearts.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.150 align:middle line:84%
One was mindfulness
practice, which we've

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:59.580 align:middle line:84%
been doing for many
years, and the other was

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.640 align:middle line:90%
the art of classroom teaching.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:10%
And we ended up
writing a nine week

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.350 align:middle line:10%
classroom introduction
to mindfulness,

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.060 align:middle line:10%
which we called Dot B.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And Dot B was really our
answer to the challenge

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:15.640 align:middle line:84%
we set ourselves, which was
to write a mindfulness course

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.410 align:middle line:84%
which was engaging,
fun, memorable,

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and also of practical
use on the roller coaster

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.850 align:middle line:90%
that is adolescence.

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We will spend a lot of time
cramming kids' brains with all

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.560 align:middle line:84%
the facts that they
need for their history,

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:34.690 align:middle line:84%
or their geography, or their
languages, or their sciences,

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:39.110 align:middle line:84%
but we never really turn the
lens inwards on their minds.

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
about mindfulness

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is that it gives you a tool to
deploy when you find yourself

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.550 align:middle line:90%
in a stressful situation.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know, OK,
if I just pause,

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.640 align:middle line:84%
if I notice how my breathing
is, I don't necessarily

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.980 align:middle line:84%
try to control it, I just notice
where it is, it switches me out

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.980 align:middle line:84%
of the thinking mode, the
ruminative, cognitive, mode,

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.120 align:middle line:90%
and into the sensing mode.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of research
is telling us at the moment,

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and what I know from my own
experience and from the kids

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.491 align:middle line:84%
that I taught, is that our kids
are pretty tough on themselves

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:15.190 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the stress,
and anxiety, and all

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.860 align:middle line:84%
of these things,
and achievement,

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the achievement ethic that
we have in the culture.

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.171 align:middle line:84%
All of these things actually
put tremendous pressure on kids

00:58:25.171 --> 00:58:25.870 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:29.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in today's world,
teens are more under pressure

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing higher levels
of stress than ever before.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And increasing
demand in technology,

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:39.260 align:middle line:84%
academic preparation, and
life transitions all result

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in physical and
emotional stressors,

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:45.820 align:middle line:84%
such as bad temper,
anxiety, depression,

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and attention-deficit disorder.

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
find out more, so I

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.720 align:middle line:84%
went to the University
of California San Diego,

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.870 align:middle line:84%
the center of
mindfulness, and spoke

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.110 align:middle line:84%
with director Steve
Hickman, and course

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.870 align:middle line:90%
instructor, Lorraine Hobbs.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:00.885 align:middle line:84%
We were running
groups, mindfulness

00:59:00.885 --> 00:59:03.950 align:middle line:84%
based stress reduction groups,
for adults for several years.

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And then as we talked to people,
other people who had taken

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.560 align:middle line:84%
the mindfulness based
stress reduction course

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and had seen what it
had done for them,

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.920 align:middle line:84%
they were sort of
thinking, wow, you know,

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.440 align:middle line:84%
my teenager could really benefit
from this, all the stress

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.290 align:middle line:90%
of teen life these days.

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Almost my entire life,
and as far as I remember,

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been dealing with
depression, anger,

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and a good deal of anxiety.

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Not being able to handle
my emotions well enough.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.250 align:middle line:90%
I had a short fuse.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Um, and I have ADHD.

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I was struggling
with my depression.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I would fight with my
parents a lot and, like,

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I would take it out on them.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point where
I started lashing out

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.210 align:middle line:84%
at my parents, so
my mom came to me,

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.010 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, we need
to find something

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:53.400 align:middle line:84%
to control your temper and to
control your ADHD way more.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And she found this mindfulness
thing and I was like, fine,

00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll try it.

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen the website for
the mindfulness center

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and kind of saw that
there was a teen group.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So I came home one day and
told my husband about it

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and I said I'm just going
to tell her she's going.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really sure,
like-- was it meditation?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Was it like a group,
therapy group?

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I came and I kind
of got a gist of what it was.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't got the practice down,
but was less resistant to go.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So after maybe two
months, I liked it a lot.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I've tried other stuff.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.785 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to the
count to 10 strategy.

01:00:32.785 --> 01:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't really work.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
After the first
day, I kind of just

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
realized there's
no turning back.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I can't go back because
where am I going to go.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:44.030 align:middle line:84%
There is no-- so I was
like I better do it right.

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:46.620 align:middle line:84%
After the first couple
times, I really look forward

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.980 align:middle line:90%
to coming here and doing it.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.520 align:middle line:84%
First few times, I was
like this makes sense to me.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I can actually-- I
can actually do it.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the first thing I've
ever done that was really

01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
all about the mind,
which, I think,

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
helps get to the
root of the problems.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They started teaching little
intricate things they have,

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
the finger tracings, 7/11, self
check-in, all these different

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.070 align:middle line:90%
have been perfected.

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness, um, teaches for
you to be mindful of yourself,

01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:17.390 align:middle line:90%
to be one with yourself.

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness is
being not mindless.

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You take a moment and
you just take a breath.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:26.105 align:middle line:84%
And that calms me down
a lot, especially when

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:29.840 align:middle line:90%
you're really anxious or mad.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.850 align:middle line:90%
That one helps me.

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you have
an uncomfortable feeling

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of sadness or anger, you're not
using those tools to exactly

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
run away from it, but to
instead examine it in a way

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're able to let it
go, but at the same time

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
dissect it and, like, understand
the feeling it in a more, like,

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
objective way, without getting
attached to it as well.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.597 align:middle line:90%
Bring yourself in and really--

01:01:53.597 --> 01:01:56.579 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness has really helped
me not to control my thoughts

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
because you're never really
going to be able to control

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:05.400 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts 100%.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will always
wonder to things.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's about, like,
redirecting your thoughts

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and reining in your thoughts
and being able to bring them

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.320 align:middle line:90%
to something more positive.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's, like, for me,
like, it's not about forgetting

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
your emotions or,
like, what's happening,

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
it's more just, like,
detaching yourself

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
from the-- like, your
emotion, but at the same time,

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.590 align:middle line:90%
observing it and accepting it.

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:32.678 align:middle line:84%
If my problem was
this cushion, like,

01:02:32.678 --> 01:02:36.040 align:middle line:90%
I'd-- sit on your problem.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.391 align:middle line:90%
Learn to be with your problem.

01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The life of a teenager
now is probably

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.957 align:middle line:84%
far more stressful even
then when I went through it.

01:02:44.957 --> 01:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, why not
give your teen the tools

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to manage their
own stress, like we're all,

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, as adults,
trying to learn them?

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I have the tools now to
understand what I'm feeling.

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm really shy feel,
so like, when I go and, like,

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
try to performance
in front of people,

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I get really, really nervous.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So I have used mindfulness for
that because it calms me down

01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and I feel more
comfortable then.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.996 align:middle line:90%


01:03:17.996 --> 01:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I try and hide
all of my anxiety

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and depression and
stuff, but with my mom,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.950 align:middle line:90%
she sees everything.

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And so she's-- she
says she's really

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
noticed a huge difference in
my attention and my moods.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that's proof of
the effectiveness of it.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I learned not to, like,
judge myself as much

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.600 align:middle line:90%
and think about the present.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Because when I think about
the past or the future, like,

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that's what causes
me a lot of anxiety.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I've got like a
mile long fuse now.

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:55.260 align:middle line:90%
It's-- it's ridiculous.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really healthy.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're making eggs,
you're mindfully making eggs.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience
now, not just a task.

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I used to wake up like three,
four times in the night.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, I only wake
up, like, twice.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But it actually really helped
me and my stress levels.

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed a huge
amount of change.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:16.858 align:middle line:84%
My mood swings aren't
nearly as violent.

01:04:16.858 --> 01:04:18.670 align:middle line:90%
My stress is completely down.

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm more
confident, more alive.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I was in a very
sorry state before I

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
discovered the practice, before
I discovered mindfulness.

01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.500 align:middle line:90%
You see, I'm bipolar, type two.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And as the diagnose--
well, tells you,

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel extremely deep
and powerful emotions

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
at almost any time,
switching very rapidly.

01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And for awhile, I felt as if I
was a victim of these feelings,

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
like they were something
that I couldn't control,

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
like they were a
monster inside me.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But then, a year ago, I started
going to the mindfulness group.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And the changes that have
happened since then, I

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
can't believe how
different things are

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:07.940 align:middle line:90%
now, much better my life is.

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I think the ambition of the
Mindfulness in Schools Project

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is partly just to
raise awareness

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:16.775 align:middle line:84%
of what mindfulness is and
give all kids a taste of it.

01:05:16.775 --> 01:05:18.905 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're not
trying to convert everyone

01:05:18.905 --> 01:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
into deep mindfulness
practitioners.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.055 align:middle line:84%
We're just trying to make
them aware of what it

01:05:23.055 --> 01:05:24.870 align:middle line:90%
is because it's common sense.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:28.340 align:middle line:10%
This, to me, seems to be
the most fundamental thing

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.090 align:middle line:10%
that we should teach our kids.

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing else to
be taught if you haven't

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.450 align:middle line:90%
learned how to pay attention.

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you teach mindfulness
at home to your kids,

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
you're actually giving them
this incredible source of

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.400 align:middle line:90%
social and emotional learning.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
You're giving them a
source of resilience.

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So those kids actually
have a different feel

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
than kids who have a mind, of
course, but don't see the mind.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
train the teachers.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
If the teachers
aren't being mindful,

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
how are the kids ever
going to be mindful.

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
we should be thinking

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.231 align:middle line:84%
that every kid in
the school is going

01:06:00.231 --> 01:06:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to want to get up in the
morning and practice mindfulness

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:03.510 align:middle line:90%
for half an hour.

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it is realistic
for every kid in school

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of mindfulness,
to know what it is,

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to have enjoyed
learning about it,

01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to have valued the experience,
so that's some of them,

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
yes, do go on to become
mindfulness teachers.

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:20.760 align:middle line:90%


01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.180 align:middle line:10%
In a sense, we human
beings on our own.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:28.280 align:middle line:10%
It may be time for us to
grow up and-- or grow down

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.550 align:middle line:10%
and become planetary adults.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And that would
mean, in some sense,

01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
a deep experiential grounding
in interconnectedness.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And if that's so, then
maybe we have a certain kind

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility
if we are ever going

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to grow into being
a planetary adult

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to actually inhabit the present
moment or rediscover it.

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:55.824 align:middle line:84%
Inhabit the present
moment or rediscover it.

01:06:55.824 --> 01:06:58.758 align:middle line:84%
Inhabit the present
moment or rediscover it.

01:06:58.758 --> 01:07:13.707 align:middle line:90%


01:07:13.707 --> 01:07:15.410 align:middle line:10%
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:16.860 align:middle line:10%
Notice anything different?

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.610 align:middle line:10%
I sure do.

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.200 align:middle line:10%
Un-huh.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:19.930 align:middle line:10%
Tell me.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:21.700 align:middle line:10%
-You got a new shirt.
-Yeah.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.470 align:middle line:10%
You became mindful.

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.250 align:middle line:10%
I did.

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:24.870 align:middle line:90%
I became mindful.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you proud of me?

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Extremely.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Wonderfulness, ridiculousness,
with a little sprinkle

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:30.820 align:middle line:90%
of mindfulness.

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.120 align:middle line:10%
You really learned
a lot with this.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.010 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I mean, I guess
it's not a big deal if you

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.030 align:middle line:10%
pay attention like you learn.

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I knew you had it in you.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Now we can be mindful together.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think
that'd be awesome.

01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:43.890 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it wasn't so hard, right?

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.140 align:middle line:10%
No, it wasn't hard.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.062 align:middle line:90%
It was easy.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.683 align:middle line:84%
-High five it.
-Thanks.

01:07:47.683 --> 01:07:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:53.060 align:middle line:10%
