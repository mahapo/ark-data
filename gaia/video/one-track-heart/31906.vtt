Ram Dass' first trip back,
as far as I remember,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:10%
from India, wearing
white clothes

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.915 align:middle line:10%
and being like a holy man.

as holy man Bob Ram Dass.

>>I saw this bulletin for
Richard Alpert giving a talk.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And I was expecting
the better living

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:10%
through modern
chemistry lecture.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:10%
And instead, I got this
guy in a white dress who'd

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:10%
just gotten off the
plane from India.

>>I walked into the room
where Ram Dass was sitting

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and immediately, I
knew that whatever

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
it was that I was looking
for, existed in the world.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:90%
It existed.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It was real.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just some fantasy.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.035 align:middle line:90%
It existed.

00:11:16.035 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just from the
drug experience, from peyote.

much from when I met him.

guitar and pop songs,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.606 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:39.006 align:middle line:90%

>>It was more than
entertainment for me, even

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:84%
then, at that time, it
was just energy release.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And kind of really entering into
it, into the song, pretty much

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:90%
the same way I chant now.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But with the chants,
instead of it

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.905 align:middle line:84%
kind of ending with the song,
it goes through the song

00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:12.813 align:middle line:84%
into a big diverse, more open
space, different, completely

00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:14.585 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The band that I had been with,
the guys in the band came to me

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and they said that they had cut
all the tracks for a record.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
But the singer who had
replaced me couldn't sings

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:90%
in the studio.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted me to come
back and cut their tracks.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And they had a whole tour
lined up and everything.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:90%
This was like what?

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:90%
This is my dream.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I was feeling from
Ram Dass was so extraordinary

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and so life affirming and
love affirming, and opening,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't
even any possibility

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I was going to do that.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.534 align:middle line:84%
Later on, they became known
as the Blue Oyster Cult.

After meeting Ram Dass, of
course, all I wanted to do

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
was spend time with him,
because he seemed to have it.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted it.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I made myself a real
pain in the ass.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.925 align:middle line:84%

work for his father

00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
there next summer, up on
his father's estate up

in New Hampshire.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:90%
So I spent a summer up there.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of the
summer, hundreds of people

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
showed up.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.265 align:middle line:90%
And people were camping.

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%

everybody could hang out.

new in the culture.

on, I began to realize

that everything was
coming through him.

And what was coming
through him was Maharaji.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:90%
He was a vehicle for Maharaji.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And so then I wanted
to go to India.

found me out, I said.

every evening he would do arati.

00:17:17.295 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%

often did was

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to ask the Western
devotees to sing.

And Krishna Das, who'd
been in a rock band

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and was already a musician,
just naturally took the lead.

for this chant or that chant.

If it's Sanskrit, you don't
quite know what its meaning is.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:57.313 align:middle line:90%
It becomes ceremony and ritual.

But not for KD.

different rhythms.

realized that Maharaji

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:10%
called mirror
neurons, for example,

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:10%
that hook up with the
state of the person's

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:10%
we're with and activate
in us that same state.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.875 align:middle line:90%
It was something like that.

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It was when you were
in his presence,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
you felt you were out
of your ordinary orbit,

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.620 align:middle line:84%
you're in another
time, in another space.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>And the one thing
I've always seen

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that has struck me
is that for, I'd say,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
virtually all of those
people, being with Maharaji

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:84%
was the single most
important thing

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that had happened to
them in their lives.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know too many
of that community who look back

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and say, eh, it was nice enough,
but I was young, I was foolish.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It remains so totally essential
to the core of their being,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:90%
it's quite remarkable.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:10%
>>He knew a path that
was right for you.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:10%
And some people, like
Danny, he set forth

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:10%
on a path of meditation, dhyan.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.965 align:middle line:84%
And Ram Dass he set forth
on a path of teaching.

00:32:29.965 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And he sent we on the
path of whatever the hell

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:90%
it is that I do.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And Krishna Das
he sent on a path

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of Bhakti yoga of devotion, and
using his voice and his heart

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to sing of love to
the gods and goddesses

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.296 align:middle line:84%
and to the inner spirit
that we all have.

00:32:54.296 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>He was always
wearing this red shmata

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that had short sleeves
and a long hem,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and no belt, or no
pockets, or anything.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like he was
in the oneness.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a one-piece.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>He became one of the most
senior of the Westerners

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to still be there, because
everyone after a while

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:90%
got jowed, kicked out.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:84%
He sort of became like
an elder brother in a way

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the satsang.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:10%
>>He changed from
being a hippie that

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:10%
was interested in music
and spiritual things

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:10%
to a spiritual person.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.980 align:middle line:84%
After that, you
could see his soul.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.965 align:middle line:90%
You could see his soul.

00:33:39.965 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.530 align:middle line:90%
We came back from India.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Krishna Das and I
followed our niche.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.062 align:middle line:84%
I'd talk about Maharaji,
and he'd sing to Maharaji.

00:33:58.062 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:10%
And they were great evenings.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:10%
>>When we sing together,
you are invited to sing.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:11.980 align:middle line:10%
If you don't sing, please,
do not feel guilty,

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:10%
because that vibration is
a total drag, all right?

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't sing, just
smile, it's OK, all right?

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.945 align:middle line:84%
Ir just sit quietly
and enjoy the singing.

00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.789 align:middle line:84%
Krishna Das and Blind
Willie Johnson's Lighthouse.

00:34:28.789 --> 00:34:34.109 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>We'll sing the chorus first.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.525 align:middle line:90%
You can learn it.

00:34:37.525 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And sing along if you'd like.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:53.202 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Shine on me.

00:34:53.202 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Let your light from the
lighthouse shine on me.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.534 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:35:15.534 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Let your light from the
lighthouse shine on me.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Let your light from the
lighthouse shine on me.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.126 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:35:42.126 --> 00:35:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Let it shine on me.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Let your light from a
lighthouse shine on me.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:36:09.185 align:middle line:84%
Let your light from a
lighthouse shine on me.

00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:09.685 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:09.685 --> 00:36:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.922 align:middle line:84%
>>At one point, just
before he left the body,

00:36:26.922 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
he had already sent
me home, but he

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.687 align:middle line:84%
was sending a lot of the
other Westerners away.

00:36:30.687 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh Baba,
we don't want to go.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.561 align:middle line:90%
We want to stay with you.

00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mate,
you have to go.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Your lives are waiting
there in America.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And besides, I gave you
more than the Indians.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.953 align:middle line:84%
He said, I let you love
me unconditionally.

00:36:42.953 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.470 align:middle line:90%
You know, who does that?

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.355 align:middle line:90%
Who can do that?

00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Who's talking?

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I let you love me
unconditionally.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>I was in India
when Maharaji died

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and we were there
when Maharaji's body

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.175 align:middle line:90%
was lying on ice.

00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:90%
It was the hardest thing.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>I was so used to having
Maharaji as an astral being,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
it didn't make a
dent in my mind.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:10%
>>

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.285 align:middle line:10%
>>Krishna Das was crying.

00:38:06.285 --> 00:38:13.985 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.985 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
As He held onto his body, he
held onto Maharaji's body.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>I was getting ready to go
back to India, when he died.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:32.742 align:middle line:84%
He had asked me to
come back, but I

00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:34.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't get it
together fast enough.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:42.750 align:middle line:84%
When I heard that he left
the body, that was it--

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.400 align:middle line:90%
my life was over.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.945 align:middle line:84%
Being with him
was the only thing

00:38:46.945 --> 00:38:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that ever made me
happy that way.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Never ever came close to that.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:20.125 align:middle line:10%
>>

00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:10%
>>I had blown the only
chance I had to be happy.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
There was no possibility
of finding that again.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I lived
for a long time feeling

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.875 align:middle line:84%
bad about that,
feeling that way.

00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:39.135 align:middle line:90%


00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:90%
A long time.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Krishna Das at that
time was really depressed.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:57.975 align:middle line:84%
>>I think sometimes he felt sort
of like a lost child in a way

00:39:57.975 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:84%
without Maharaji
around every day.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We, in a way, the more that
you were physically with him,

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:84%
the more dependent
you became on Maharaji

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
for so many different parts of
your spiritual and practical

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.960 align:middle line:84%
life, and when that tie
was abruptly severed,

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.945 align:middle line:84%
everybody went through different
stages of mourning and grief.

00:40:23.945 --> 00:40:29.914 align:middle line:84%
>>I didn't have any no
direction, no nothing.

00:40:29.914 --> 00:40:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I was nothing I wanted
to do especially.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't need any money.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So I was just wandering
around, staying with friends

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and taking it easy, and
doing this, painting houses

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:45.268 align:middle line:84%
and drove a truck for a
while, stuff like that.

00:40:45.268 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:90%


00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.935 align:middle line:90%
And feeling very lost.

00:40:52.935 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But I was living in
despair, quiet despair,

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:05.295 align:middle line:84%
because I've believed that I
would never be happy again,

00:41:05.295 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that Maharaji being
gone physically

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:12.625 align:middle line:84%
was something I
would never get over

00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and I would never
find that anywhere.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.115 align:middle line:84%
So what did it
matter what I did?

00:41:19.115 --> 00:41:19.614 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:19.614 --> 00:41:20.991 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And I just basically gave up.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.325 align:middle line:84%
>>What is it you
want this lifetime?

00:41:28.325 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:35.532 align:middle line:10%
What is it you want?

00:41:35.532 --> 00:41:40.350 align:middle line:10%
You try to optimize
pleasure and minimize pain.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:45.832 align:middle line:84%
You try to get high
and avoid the low.

00:41:45.832 --> 00:41:48.046 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd started messing
around with cocaine.

00:41:48.046 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I got involved with some coke.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, somebody
turned me onto freebase,

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:84%
which is like crack, but a very
much purer form even of that.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And I got addicted to freebase.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And for about a
year and a half, I

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:13.166 align:middle line:84%
was very involved with smoking--
you smoke it in a pipe.

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It was, it's the only thing that
ever really, really fooled me.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:35.012 align:middle line:84%
I really, I really was-- I
couldn't do anything about it.

00:42:35.012 --> 00:42:38.245 align:middle line:90%
I was, I was fucked up.

00:42:38.245 --> 00:42:40.169 align:middle line:90%
And there was no way out of it.

00:42:40.169 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I was really strung out.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I was in New York to see Mr.
Tewari, my Indian father, who

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.557 align:middle line:84%
was coming to visit
some people in Canada.

00:42:49.557 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then he was going
to come to the States.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.765 align:middle line:84%
So I was on my way up
to Canada to see him.

00:42:53.765 --> 00:42:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I stopped at my
father's apartment.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And after he went to sleep,
I stayed up all night smoking

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:84%
freebase in the bedroom,
the upper bedroom.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:13.396 align:middle line:84%
And late at night, early in
the morning, I had run out,

00:43:13.396 --> 00:43:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and I was scrounging
around on the floor

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:84%
to see if I'd dropped
a little piece

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:22.866 align:middle line:84%
of this white kind
of whatever it is.

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was smoking like
the lint from socks,

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.460 align:middle line:90%
you know, and stuff like that.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, I got
off the plane in Canada,

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:90%
and I went to see Mr. Tweari.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked
in the room, he

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on the
other side of the room

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.504 align:middle line:84%
with his back towards
me, talking to somebody.

00:43:45.504 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in the
room and I stopped,

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.286 align:middle line:84%
because usually I would
just go running to see him,

00:43:53.286 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and I stopped and I felt
like this-- I just stopped.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Like a force field.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just started to
back out of the room.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And he turned and
he pointed at me

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and he said, promise me
now you'll give up cocaine.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Promise me now!

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And this guy, you have
no idea about this guy.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.805 align:middle line:84%
He was an incredible
yogi and a meditatator,

00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and and amazing being and he
just had more power than--

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And he just was looking at me.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't give
me any choice.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.554 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:37.546 align:middle line:84%
From that moment
on, I never smoked.

00:44:37.546 --> 00:44:39.905 align:middle line:90%
Totally stopped, instantly.

00:44:39.905 --> 00:44:43.811 align:middle line:84%
It was all his shakti, his
power and his blessing.

00:44:43.811 --> 00:44:48.299 align:middle line:90%
And that saved me from that.

00:44:48.299 --> 00:44:50.295 align:middle line:90%
I was going down.

00:44:50.295 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
From that moment on, a pile
of freebase, a pile of shit,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:90%
pretty much the same.

I will eat it all.

that, because, at that point,

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:28.200 align:middle line:84%

functional for your awakening,

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.270 align:middle line:84%

literally becomes grace.

for him to come back
physically in a way,

that he and my family
had always done.

singing at Jivamukti

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:59.420 align:middle line:10%
and made his chanting
accessible, you know,

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:10%
singing for free, he
received invitations

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.410 align:middle line:10%
from other yoga studios
around the country.

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:10%
>>Everyone recognized
quite quickly

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:13.830 align:middle line:10%
that it's a spiritual
tradition of music that

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.700 align:middle line:10%
organizes your mind
in the same way

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.380 align:middle line:10%
that all the other
yoga practices do,

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.040 align:middle line:10%
that directs your
energy in a way

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:26.040 align:middle line:10%
that is toward God realization
or toward enlightenment.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.242 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, you can't
go to a yoga studio,

00:53:28.242 --> 00:53:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and there are 5,000,
probably, in this country,

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.190 align:middle line:84%

Krishna Das in the background.

>>Kirtan, I think, will
become more and more popular,

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.110 align:middle line:10%
purely based on the fact
that yoga is becoming more

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:38.970 align:middle line:10%
and more popular.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.595 align:middle line:84%
The way that yoga is
done in these days

00:53:40.595 --> 00:53:45.070 align:middle line:84%
is a lot less hippy-dippy,
less new agey.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:48.312 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
beginning to just open up

00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:50.020 align:middle line:84%
to this in a very
different way than what

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.785 align:middle line:90%
they might have 20-30 years ago.

00:53:51.785 --> 00:53:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>>I remember the first time I
went, I was shy about chanting.

00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:00.670 align:middle line:10%
To make the leap
of just chanting,

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.210 align:middle line:10%
I felt self-conscious and
uncomfortable doing it

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:04.410 align:middle line:10%
at first.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, by the end of
it, all that went away,

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and it felt pretty natural.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.255 align:middle line:84%
And felt like it
opened doors in me.

00:54:12.255 --> 00:54:13.710 align:middle line:90%
And I like that feeling.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Working with Rick Rubin was
a great honor for Krishna Das,

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.470 align:middle line:84%
simply because he's one of
the most brilliant producers.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.785 align:middle line:84%
And what he created
was stunning,

00:54:22.785 --> 00:54:24.580 align:middle line:84%
from what Krishna
Das already did,

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and he made it musically
very beautiful and accessible

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:29.590 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Musically, he's
so extraordinary.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I was really touched that
he liked the chanting.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
probably reached people

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.210 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't heard of it
before because of his name

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.690 align:middle line:90%

When I first started singing
with people, it was great.

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I was enjoying it a lot.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
people started to come,

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and it started to become
a little bit of the scene.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that I was going to
get more and more popular, more

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and more attention.

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And that, because of
my own hungry desires,

my desires for fame,

all this stuff, that there was
no possibility of me doing this

way, that I was

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:33.560 align:middle line:84%
going to misuse
all this power that

was coming to me to
feed those desires.

And there was no possibility
that I wasn't going to do that.

I was horrified.

Finally, I was
doing the one thing

00:56:55.710 --> 00:57:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that I felt could bring me
back to Maharaji's presence,

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:04.210 align:middle line:84%
bring me back into that
love that I felt I had lost.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:08.419 align:middle line:84%
And I was being prevented
from doing it by my own stuff.

I quit.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:18.370 align:middle line:90%
And I went to India.

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:22.200 align:middle line:10%
I knew that Maharaji
was the only one who

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.670 align:middle line:10%
could change what
was in my heart.

he was going to do
something, even though he

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:10%
had left his body 20 years
already at this point.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:40.100 align:middle line:84%
We went to Kainchi
to see Siddhi Ma.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And Ma said to me,
what are your plans?

But she asked me
to stay, I'll stay.

00:58:15.327 --> 00:58:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And every day, I was
singing with the kirtan

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.590 align:middle line:90%
wallahs for many hours.

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And it was good.

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But still, I knew, nothing
had changed in my heart.

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the night
before the Bhandara,

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.792 align:middle line:84%
that night I looked
up at the stars

00:58:26.792 --> 00:58:28.000 align:middle line:90%
and I started talking to him.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you haven't
changed anything.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand why not.

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:38.681 align:middle line:84%
Then I said, well, I can't make
you do it if you don't want to.

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:40.410 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I'll go back, I'll sing.

How bad could it be?

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.216 align:middle line:84%

very quiet and subtle.

I was just watching
these people come and go,

01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and it reminded me of this
part of the Bhagavad Gita,

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
where Krishna shows
Arjuna his divine form.

moving it the Universe.

been sitting there, no idea.

everything is held in space.

knew myself as was not there

cause the wave to be formed.

The wave must think it's
really great, right?

01:02:36.595 --> 01:02:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And then it dissolves.

here, big, wet ocean.

go back to America

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and really to be
able to sing 100%,

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't
about me, which

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
is what I had been longing
for to be free to sing,

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.290 align:middle line:90%
to not be in my own way.

I was out of my own way.

There was nobody
there to turn it off,

01:03:38.936 --> 01:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to push it away, to
turn the volume down,

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.091 align:middle line:90%

I was freed from thinking
that I was doing this,

01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
that I was the one chanting,
that it was my responsibility,

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:19.230 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't about me at all.

And the people
who were attracted

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
to me and to the chanting,
and coming towards that,

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
they might think they
were attracted to me,

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but what they were
really attracted to

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
was the connection and
connecting to Maharaji,

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.770 align:middle line:90%
connecting to that love.

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
later that I remembered

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
what Siddhi Ma said,
that you have to stay,

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to see
Maharaji's big form.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Maharaji was no longer that
little guy in a blanket.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:54.000 align:middle line:90%
This was who he is.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I really began to see
what chanting was about

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.385 align:middle line:84%
and experienced
it personally how

01:04:58.385 --> 01:05:01.970 align:middle line:84%
it would allow me
to keep letting

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
go of the stuff that
pulled me out of myself

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and bring me back to that place
that I had been in, back, out,

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and back, out and back,
over, and over, and over.

a way to come back.
