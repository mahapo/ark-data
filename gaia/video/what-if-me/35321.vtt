00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:05.210
(soft guitar)

2
00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:28.112
<v ->What if, like me,</v>

3
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.795
you've got your routine?

4
00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:43.332
<v ->Afternoon. What can I get ya?</v>

5
00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:45.042
<v ->Apple pie and custard, please.</v>

6
00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.985
<v ->That's two pounds.</v>

7
00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:05.369
<v ->It might be a morning thing, lunch time, after work.</v>

8
00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:07.697
Wherever.

9
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.312
Life's just taken over.

10
00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:35.244
One day rolls into the next.

11
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.781 line:15% 
And then,

12
00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:42.017
Out of the blue,

13
00:01:43.088 --> 00:01:44.193
Wallop.

14
00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:46.693
It hits ya.

15
00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:47.634
Whoa.

16
00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:49.550
Where'd that come from?

17
00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:04.383
(heartbeats)

18
00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.822 line:15% 
And what if, like me--

19
00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:16.251
<v ->Good afternoon. What will it be today?</v>

20
00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:19.375
<v ->Apple pie and custard, please.</v>

21
00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.240
You're useless at this sort of thing.

22
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.094
You're all fingers and thumbs.

23
00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:50.555
Cat's got your tongue.

24
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.685
Oh, I don't know, any other lousy metaphor.

25
00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:23.678
And then, what if, like me, you tell yourself,

26
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.600 line:15% 
just talk to her?

27
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.092
What's the worst that can happen?

28
00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:33.979
<v ->Hello there. Now let me guess...</v>

29
00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.921 line:15% 
<v ->You're desperate to say something.</v>

30
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.965 line:15% 
Anything.

31
00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.918 line:15% 
But all you can manage is,

32
00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.492
apple pie and custard please.

33
00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.266
And just when you think that things can't get any worse,

34
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:02.145
(upbeat music)

35
00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:07.328
life just kicks you in the nuts.

36
00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:11.661
<v ->Afternoon. What can I get ya?</v>

37
00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:13.038
<v ->Good question.</v>

38
00:04:13.882 --> 00:04:16.131
I'll have a smile to start with.

39
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.949
That's better.

40
00:04:20.852 --> 00:04:22.049
Let me see.

41
00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:24.611
How about,

42
00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:27.023
your number?

43
00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:28.538
<v ->I don't think so.</v>

44
00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:30.222
<v ->No?</v>

45
00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:34.000
Give me a hundred good reasons why not, and I'll walk away.

46
00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:36.803
<v ->What can I get ya?</v>

47
00:04:36.803 --> 00:04:39.327
<v ->Okay, okay, a cup of tea, please.</v>

48
00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:42.470
And your number.

49
00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:23.625
<v ->But, what if, like me,</v>

50
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:27.763
you find a way to change all that?

51
00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:33.267
You find a time portal.

52
00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:41.466
A time portal, I know. Handy eh?

53
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.620
And this time portal allows you to,

54
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.493
you can see where this is heading.

55
00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:49.011
Allows you to,

56
00:05:49.944 --> 00:05:52.037
go back in time.

57
00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:55.079
Back to the very moment you want to change.

58
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.642
So, you're up all night.

59
00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:02.762
You make sure you're looking your best.

60
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:06.702
Looking good. Feeling good.

61
00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:08.828
You're on top of the world.

62
00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:11.669
(shooting gun sounds)

63
00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.265
Life is beautiful.

64
00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:19.534
There's no turning back.

65
00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:24.341 line:15% 
You walk through the time portal on your date with destiny.

66
00:06:30.192 --> 00:06:32.538
Weird, you say to yourself.

67
00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:37.193
But you don't quite know how this time travel luck works.

68
00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:38.215
Just yet.

69
00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:42.132
<v ->Hello there. Now let me guess...</v>

70
00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:44.265
<v ->The moment of truth.</v>

71
00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:49.641
And then it comes out.

72
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:52.813
Apple pie and custard, please.

73
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.720
But you don't give up.

74
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.043
It's a time portal.

75
00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:12.085
You go back, have another bash.

76
00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:16.961 line:15% 
You walk through the time portal, on your date with destiny.

77
00:07:19.808 --> 00:07:20.557
Again.

78
00:07:21.523 --> 00:07:24.046
Weird, you say to yourself.

79
00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:25.327
And again.

80
00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:26.832
And you still don't quite know

81
00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:28.697
how this time travel luck works.

82
00:07:28.697 --> 00:07:29.648
Just yet.

83
00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:33.167
<v ->Hello there. Now, let me guess...</v>

84
00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:36.007
<v ->The moment of truth.</v>

85
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.412
And then it comes out.

86
00:07:41.412 --> 00:07:43.064
Apple pie and custard, please.

87
00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:44.236
Again.

88
00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:58.076
That's when you realize how this time travel luck works.

89
00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:02.956 line:15% 
You go back in time with the same set of life skills

90
00:08:02.956 --> 00:08:04.726 line:15% 
and experience.

91
00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:07.568
You haven't grown, you haven't moved on.

92
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:12.828
<v ->Hello there. Now let me guess...</v>

93
00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:23.335
<v ->Apple pie and custard, please.</v>

94
00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:26.868
Of course you do it all again in exactly the same way.

95
00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:29.557
You haven't changed.

96
00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:32.559
You haven't learned from anything.

97
00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:36.208
You've just gone back in time.

98
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.388
So, what if, like me,

99
00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:43.708 line:15% 
you're a thinker?

100
00:08:44.689 --> 00:08:46.422 line:15% 
A day dreamer?

101
00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:48.834
You keep mulling things over.

102
00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:50.828
Lost in another time.

103
00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:54.647
Past failures sitting heavy on your soul.

104
00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:25.027
You might just miss out on what's around the corner.

105
00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:29.167
