00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, if you
produce your own electricity,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:90%
you're off-the-grid.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, we use that expression
in other contexts as well.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Now generally, people
that are self-sufficient

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
for their electricity
are also off other grids.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.865 align:middle line:10%
They may have their
own water supply.

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:10%
They may take care
of their own garbage

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:10%
rather than have pickup.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.440 align:middle line:10%
They may have no television, for
example, and things like that.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.717 align:middle line:10%
I'm interested in
this for two reasons.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:10%
The first reason is
because we keep hearing,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:10%
as a society, that bad
things are to come,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:10%
because we are running out
of those resources that

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:10%
have made our life possible--

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:10%
oil.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Coal is of course
still abundant,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to
be with us forever.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Resources are becoming
more and more expensive.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And so we hear that our
life is going to change.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Things are never
going to be the same.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:10%
I can't tell the future.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:90%
I can tell the present, though.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:10%
And I'm interested
in documenting

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:10%
the lives of those people that
are living in the future today

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:10%
and are relying on
renewable resources today.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested in seeing
what their life is all about.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.933 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we do by traveling
the country and going to every

00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
single province and territory,
we actually learn different

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.115 align:middle line:84%
environments where people
adapt in different ways.

00:10:00.115 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> They let you do that?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I would say that
what has made our work possible

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that pretty much
everyone who's off-grid wants

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
to teach others.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
You and I probably don't
know half of the skills

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:90%
that our grandparents had--

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
skills on how to
build a fire properly

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
or how to can your
vegetables that you've

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:90%
grown in your garden.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that if
we continue, as a society,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
to forget these skills, we'll
be less and less self-sufficient

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and more and more reliant
on distant providers that

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:90%
burn non-renewable resources.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Generally, we like to begin
with a million dollar question.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
We live in a country that
is, by historical and global

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
standards, a pretty
comfortable place.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We've got access to all kinds
of comforts and conveniences--

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
all technologies
that have supposedly

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:90%
made our lives easier, better.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And here we have,
instead, a group

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of people who go off-the-grid
and disconnect themselves

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%
from this kind of world.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.488 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:11:21.488 --> 00:11:22.288 align:middle line:10%
>> Good question.

00:11:22.288 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:10%
>> [CHUCKLE] Told you, it
can get you going for hours.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Why, indeed.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
amount of, let's see

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
how little I can get by with.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how basic
I can make my life

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
or how simple I can
make my life and still

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:90%
be happy and comfortable.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It's equal parts
necessity and philosophy.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
When I decided that I wanted
to live at this location,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
there was no option
of having electricity.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this location
was off-the-grid.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:90%
The grid was miles away.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:90%
There was no chance.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
But I've stayed here so long
that the grid has actually

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
crept closer and
closer and closer.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We need more power because our
little farm has been growing.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And we had actually
made the decision

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
to bite the bullet

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and have the power come
the rest of the way.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we got into all
kinds of negotiations

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and difficult things about
easements and whatnot, whatnot.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't pan out.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:10%
When that choice seemed to be
slipping through our fingers,

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:10%
then we actually tripled
our solar capacity.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Brian, I wonder if someone
from Yukon Power came in today

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, we're putting
a grid closer to your place

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:90%
and no extra expense to you.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:90%
We can connect you.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to be connected?

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to them?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we would do
it to get the power in.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
We've been off-grid
for 30 years.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It's probably time.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is our home.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
We will probably
always live here.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
How long we'll continue
to farm I guess

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:84%
will depend on our level
of energy and stuff.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think we will live here
until we just absolutely cannot

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.753 align:middle line:90%
live here anymore.

00:13:36.753 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something that I
love, and I've always loved,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
about the bush, the wilderness,
even as a child in California,

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
backpacking into
the high Sierras.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
The decision to live
off-grid was not

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:84%
saying we are determined
to live off-grid.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It was more, we're determined
to live in the bush.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
do that was off-grid.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I meet people who are
similarly off-grid or whatever.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it comes from an
apocalyptic view of the world.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:10%
And we had a guest
here the other day

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:10%
who is very committed
to storing up food.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.012 align:middle line:10%
And he sees what--

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Almost like a survivalist.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, a survivalist
kind of thing.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he looks at what's
happening with the economy

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And for him, it's
the precipice of--

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and so he was
wondering what we had

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
been doing to make sure
that [CHUCKLE] we were ready

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:90%
for the coming apocalypse.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.382 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not off-grid
in principle,

00:14:46.382 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
is probably the
best way to put it.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I would have used their power.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just not feasible,
economically--

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> How much would
it have cost you?

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I never
totally checked it out.

00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But I'm guessing a quarter of
a million dollars or something.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.352 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:15:05.352 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a common thing.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.227 align:middle line:84%
The people come and they
see the wind turbine.

00:15:08.227 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
They see the solar
collectors and stuff.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And then they say, wow.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.905 align:middle line:90%
You get your power for free.

00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I always have to
laugh and say, well, no.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what I did was I paid
for 30 years of power upfront.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
When there's excess power, the
batteries are fully charged.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:10%
So if the wind is blowing
and the sun is shining

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:10%
and the batteries
are fully charged,

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:10%
basically it's just dumping--

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:10%
we have more power
than we can use.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So here is what I call the
upper array because there's

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:90%
the lower array.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
So each of these is 175 watts.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.875 align:middle line:90%
So 6 times 175--

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:56.122 align:middle line:90%
>> There's 12 of them.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And there are 12 of them--

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:90%
24 altogether.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now how did you learn
to do all this stuff?

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> By trying.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.538 align:middle line:90%
And I made mistakes, but--

00:16:08.538 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
so you had to redo stuff.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't speedy.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Reading, researching,
trial and error,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%
and asking questions you know.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Seeking advice from
people who know

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and who were happy to
share their knowledge.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.838 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about anything.

00:16:20.838 --> 00:16:24.415 align:middle line:84%
If you thought about any
kind of project and--

00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
as a whole and said,
how can I do that?

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.975 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming.

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's the old adage,
how do you eat an elephant?

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:90%
One bite at a time.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't have to
figure out everything

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:90%
before I figured out this part.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.142 align:middle line:84%
And as this part evolved, then I
needed to figure out this part.

00:16:40.142 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Then I figured out that part.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you move along,
it evolves and it works.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Then you find your
way step by step.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's only looking back that
you realize, oh my goodness.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%
How did I pull that off?

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I live on a small island.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I am self-reliant for
my own water supply.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I moved there,
I realized how much

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
your attitude
changes when you are

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:90%
self-sufficient for something.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're much more
careful with it.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to see if other
people also were as careful.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You have somebody
taping this right now,

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
so you're kind of documenting
everything as you go along.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> We work nonstop.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really
becoming-- this, I guess,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.269 align:middle line:90%
is part of ethnography to--

00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --document in
whatever way you can.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
If people listening want to
get in touch, can they do that?

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:90%
I would love to.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
If they're off-the-grid,
we'll make our way there.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look back on any
life, it's a bunch of stepping

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:90%
stones.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And you just never know where
they're going to take you.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So my training was
industrial electronics.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And Joanna was a
registered dietitian.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was working at a
company, electronics company.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt there
had to be more to life.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:10%
Joanna came up with the
floor plan for the house

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:10%
that she wanted to have.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So I took the floor
plans and I researched

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
construction
techniques that would

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:90%
deal with a harsher climate.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was not impressed
with what I researched.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with
a unique design.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anybody else do it.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, everything has
worked better than I expected.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know a lot of the
things I've learned because I--

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:10%
every challenge we came
up against, what did I do?

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Some research.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I found out how to
do it and I did it.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, how
did you get this done?

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Or you can't do that.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's nonsense.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Of course I can do it.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:10%
We haven't run up
against anything

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:10%
that we haven't been able
to do or handle ourselves.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%
We're retired school teachers.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And we spent--

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>> 35 years in town.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> 35 years in the town.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we wanted to
do when we retired--

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
the first thing we did
was sell the house in town

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and move out here to the bush.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically we've got
everything we could possibly

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.123 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got all the comfort--

00:19:46.123 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> All the comforts of home.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> All the necessary
conveniences?

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> We watch all the TV.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
We listen to the stereo.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
We have all the lights
that we want on.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:90%
We--

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Have a computer.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We run the coffeemaker.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
We run-- [CHUCKLE] We do
all those kinds of things.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a rare
thing, fortunately,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't been able to fix
something or jury-rig something

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to get it to go.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You must have had some
contract to do some part--

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> We've done it all ourselves.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.212 align:middle line:90%
>> I did absolutely everything.

00:20:19.212 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Part of living out here
is having an inventory

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:10%
and anticipating what things
and spare parts are you going

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:10%
to need.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We have degrees coming out
of our ears from this place.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> So many books.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have tons
and tons of books.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> With anything, machine
or engine-wise, I mean,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
there are certain things that
you can take a wild stab at.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.013 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I built this thing.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, oh,
well, that's not enough.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And generally, if something's
going to break down, I mean,

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
something simple.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Just this fall, I built this
air compressor out of a lawn

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:90%
mower motor.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Very rarely have we had
to deal with something that

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be fixed out here.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.722 align:middle line:84%
The generator was
definitely one of them.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I guess that's really--

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the first wind turbine.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
That was the second one.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but that's
not our problem.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's faulty.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Or we could debate
the design of that.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there's a million things.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.052 align:middle line:84%
I also want to build
an electric car.

00:21:23.052 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's definitely a feeling
that most of the population is

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:90%
really dependent on others.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And being out here, we're
dependent on ourselves.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:49.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The oven is a little bit
tricky sometimes to get used

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But once you get the
hang of it, I don't know,

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:84%
it just becomes
like second nature.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
If I was to have this
on all day long, even

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
in the wintertime
on a sunny day,

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
it would get
stiflingly hot in here.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really important
in this country is that,

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
first of all, we have massive
amounts of insulation.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important thing.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that we
have tons of material that

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:90%
can be used as thermal mass.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So once you warm it up, it
retains the heat and radiates

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:90%
heat for days and days and days.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, for example,
I have 5,000 gallons

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of water in the crawlspace
under the floor,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:90%
under where you're sitting--

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
always different jugs,
different sizes--

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.385 align:middle line:84%
2 gallon jugs, 5 gallon
jugs, 13 gallon jugs--

00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Soap and wax jugs,
that sort of thing.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --that originally had soap
and wax and laundry detergent.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And some of these--

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.698 align:middle line:84%
I've been collecting these
from the hotels in Dawson.

00:22:54.698 --> 00:22:57.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't recycle them.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.085 align:middle line:90%
They just throw them away.

00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> These are questions that
I haven't asked before,

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:90%
because you guys are so remote.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
How often do you leave the
house on a yearly basis

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
or monthly basis?

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Generally, twice a year.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Usually in spring, like March,
before the ice goes out.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And then in the fall,
end of September,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
beginning of October, before
the ice starts forming.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Our daughter
lives in Edmonton,

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and we go and visit
her quite often.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And our son lives
in Dawson Creek,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:90%
which is only 35 miles away.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But we have a lot of friends
that come from other cities

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and camp out here with us,
in the summer especially.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We're comfortable
with our own company.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We're not antisocial, but we're
just happy to be out here.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
We have no set schedule.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:10%
We see the rest of the world
as working and spinning

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:10%
their wheels like a hamster in
a cage trying to just make money

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.362 align:middle line:10%
to live and survive.

00:24:03.362 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Aren't you afraid
of loneliness?

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you afraid of just--

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Isn't it intimidating to
be all by yourself out here?

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-uh.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:10%

not antisocial.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.383 align:middle line:10%
I would do that because it's
going to be that much fresher.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%

for, say, broccoli one trip.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%

weeks later, it'll be double.

it was projected to one day go

00:26:04.993 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we've got a fully
functional town sitting

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere
in the Arctic, which

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:90%
is really quite fascinating.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.623 align:middle line:10%
they come up and try and
sometimes sensationalize-- oh,

00:26:21.623 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:10%
we're in the isolated north.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:10%
But when you're living here--
and I've been here 18 years--

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:10%
it's no different than
any small town in Canada.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
You'd need a town of
probably about 60,000 people

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to get the amenities
that we have here.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%

and you say, well--

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
map and where we are.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But Inuvik is a
small town in Canada.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a small
town anywhere in Canada.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, starting
mid-to-late October.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:10%
That's when it starts because
things start to freeze

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:10%
in the two river crossings.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's impossible
to take a boat across.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:10%
So they have to close
the ferry crossings

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:10%
and just wait until
it's frozen enough

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.273 align:middle line:10%
that you can then drive across.

00:27:05.273 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:84%
When they're doing that,
during the freeze up,

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
everything perishable
has to be flown in.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:10%
So the cost of dairy products
goes through the roof.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:10%
The flip side of it,
the actual break up--

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:10%
when that happens in May, that's
when people are celebrating

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:10%
or placing bets as to what
day the river will break up.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
That ice road is--

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of an artery for
transportation around here

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of local
folks have camps.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And they can take the ice road--

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:10%
can take their Ski-Doo
out there and just go up

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:10%

off the river.

I have the summer
one for whales.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And I have the fall one
for hunting the caribou.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:10%
And our whale, our beluga whale,
we get that in the summertime.

ourselves because of--

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:90%
we can do it.

I was already drawing houses

00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:84%
An earthship is an idea that
came to Michael Reynolds

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:90%
about 35 years ago.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.750 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to build
a house that would

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
be easy to build for
everybody so everybody

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:84%
could have a house instead
of having a mortgage.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So they made the earthship
as to be autonomous, create

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:84%
its own power,
collect its own water,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:84%
reuse the water as
much as possible,

00:33:55.350 --> 00:34:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and also build it out of
material that is available.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And the principal
component that everybody

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:84%
talks about when talking about
an earthship is the tires.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And you just basically
use the tires

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:90%
as a form to pound dirt into it.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a
land-earth house

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:84%
where the tires are used as
a form that stays in place.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:84%

the rocks were.

of the main house

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.188 align:middle line:10%

What you're feeling is plaster.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But inside, which you can
see on the outside easily,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
is a mixture of sand, clay,
and straw mixed together

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.440 align:middle line:90%
with water.

The cob itself is strong
enough to do that.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%

that's been used

It's dirt cheap.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I probably paid $200 to $300
for the sand to be delivered.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what else I paid for.

I mean, I bought the doors used.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Wood is cheap.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:10%
And metal roofing and
foundations are expensive.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:10%
So I thought, I'll get
extra square footage

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:10%
for cheap by building
lots of floors.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:84%
When I started this house, I
might have had a couple grand

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to my name that I'd scraped
together over the last seven

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.450 align:middle line:90%
or eight years.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So everything had to be
low tech and low cost.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So most of the choices
I made are just

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:84%
your default
off-the-grid choices.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:10%
It makes sense
conceptually, in a way--

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:10%
unless you try to live in
it and then you realize,

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm 40 years old.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't run up and down
seven flights of stairs twice

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.755 align:middle line:84%
or three or four times a day
every time I forget a sock

00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people's
houses are fantasies.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's building their
fantasy little dream house.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, I consider
that to be a ridiculous way

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:90%
to spend time.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just a distraction
from important things.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.876 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:40.876 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the same way
as everything else.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not because a house
is big that it's more

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.895 align:middle line:90%
complicated than anything else.

00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one
step at a time.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You just have to try
and see the big picture

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and then split it
up in little pieces.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not living off-grid
that is the answer.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.655 align:middle line:84%
And it's not living in an
earthship that's the answer.

00:38:14.655 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of thinking
that needs to change.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Being able to realize
where things come from

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.710 align:middle line:90%
and what they actually cost.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's obviously
no water here right now?

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.290 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.380 align:middle line:10%
It comes from way up top
and then through this pipe

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:10%
all the way down here--

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.920 align:middle line:10%
a little turbine-- you
might be able to see--

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:10%
that the water hits.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:10%
And so it spins and
it makes electricity.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:10%
>> It sounds stupid and it
sounds like I'm being hokey

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual or
whatever, but you do--

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:10%
I had to, anyway.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure out where
the water is coming from.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
things to suit--

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.220 align:middle line:90%
you see how far the frost goes.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.440 align:middle line:84%
You see how far the water
goes into the ground when

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:90%
it's not moving.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not rocket science.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's more precise
than rocket science.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.180 align:middle line:84%
This disk here,
this flywheel, there

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is very high strength
magnets underneath.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.285 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns, it
passes by-- there's

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:31.800 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of
coils under there.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it 24 of them?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, as it spins,
it makes power.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
If there was enough fall,
if there was enough water,

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:90%
it could make 500 watts.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Me, I've only got a
32-foot fall over 300 feet.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.280 align:middle line:10%
So there is loss in the pipe.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So when the pond is
up and it's running,

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I would say maybe 90 watts--

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:90%
80-90 watts.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing about
it is it's 24 hours a day.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Each of those
panels is 180 watts.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:90%
So there's 360 watts.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.250 align:middle line:90%
That's ideal.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's say 340 watts really--

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.233 align:middle line:84%
full, direct sunlight,
which is rare.

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:90%
When does that happen?

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.576 align:middle line:90%
In the summer.

00:40:24.576 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically you've got
about 400 watts worth of PV

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:90%
on our old panels.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And then we added 600 there.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's about 1,000
watts worth of panels.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.850 align:middle line:10%
So that's 1,000 watts,
or it's a kilowatt.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:38.690 align:middle line:10%
So if I get five hours of
sunshine on those panels,

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:10%
I end up with five kilowatts--
or five kilowatt hours

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.560 align:middle line:10%
of electricity.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.874 align:middle line:84%
The average family in
Ontario uses about 35 hours

00:40:44.874 --> 00:40:45.674 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:40:45.674 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So I can live on five
hours of kilowatt--

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
five kilowatt hours if I
shift my thermal or my heat

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:90%
loads to propane.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done over time
is increased our panels.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:84%
We've added a second
set of solar panels

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:03.650 align:middle line:84%
in the wind turbine so we can
reduce how much propane we

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.120 align:middle line:90%
have to use.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But we lived off-grid,
and everybody talks

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:90%
about kilowatt hours.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And I never understood it.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:90%
So I said, until I got--

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I figured this is 1,000 watts.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I get an hour worth
of sun comes on,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I get 1 kilowatt
hour of electricity.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And it all started
making sense to me.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.425 align:middle line:10%
>> My solar panels are
all up on the roof.

00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:22.070 align:middle line:10%
>> That's so small.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.570 align:middle line:10%
I was expecting something--

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:24.723 align:middle line:10%
>> We have more than that.

00:41:24.723 --> 00:41:25.640 align:middle line:10%
There's also another--

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's about one kilowatt.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We have two more kilowatts
right on the roof.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:30.895 align:middle line:10%
>> I built this myself.

00:41:30.895 --> 00:41:31.695 align:middle line:10%
I'm very proud.

00:41:31.695 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:10%
>> You built this yourself?

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:10%
>> It's my first wind turbine
tower that I ever built.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Mind you, I had a kit.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a kit, comes from Michigan.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:90%
And it has instructions.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Its wind tower building
for the complete idiot.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.645 align:middle line:84%
I need to lower it once
a year because this--

00:41:47.645 --> 00:41:48.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Need to lower--

00:41:48.617 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> --wind turbine-- yeah--

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:90%
needs to be inspected.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.035 align:middle line:84%
And it's infinitely
easier to lower the pole

00:41:55.035 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and look at the generator than
it is to climb up the pole

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and look at the generator.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Or one thing that
does come to mind--

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.780 align:middle line:10%
and we're kind of
proud about it--

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:10%
is that we've never
had a power bill.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.120 align:middle line:10%
We've heard people--
we've heard talk about it.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.080 align:middle line:84%
We really don't
know what they are.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our design factors was
that people coming to visit us

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:84%
would not know that
we lived off-grid.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this a normal
dishwasher or--

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an Energy Star
compliant dishwasher.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have choices
to run it low power.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.190 align:middle line:90%
So its consumption is minimal.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And we choose when
we want to run it.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we say, it's a good
time to run the dishwasher.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
The sun's out.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.165 align:middle line:90%


00:42:38.165 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We utilize our stuff
as much as we want,

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.360 align:middle line:84%
but there's always an
eye on the battery.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.720 align:middle line:84%
There's always that thought
in the back of your head,

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.660 align:middle line:90%
are we using too much?

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.107 align:middle line:90%
And what's the weather like?

00:42:59.107 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:90%
What's the weather--

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Got a cloudy
stretch coming up--

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It looks like we've got a--

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --or we-- oh, great.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.010 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go in the hole.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just like to stay fully
charged as much as possible.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where the
electricity lives.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
We have a 1,500 amp hour,
a 24 volt battery bank.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And 2 and 1/2 kilowatt inverter.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> A couple charge controllers,
Maximum Power Point Tracking

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.470 align:middle line:90%
charge controllers.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:31.960 align:middle line:90%
This is what's called the MATE.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the brains of the system.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So right now I just
heard it kick on.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.540 align:middle line:90%
So something's just turned on.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're now using
1,800 watts of power.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Batteries are 49.2 volts.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:84%
The output so far today, in
terms of generating power,

goes back and forth.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:90%
We've generated-- what was it?

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Nine-- there.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Nine amps.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.980 align:middle line:90%
440 watts.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:90%
So not very much.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Today is a gray day
and there's no wind.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're
inverting 1,800 watts.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're using more power
than we're producing.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I figure the whole
system probably cost

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.365 align:middle line:90%
in the neighborhood of $60,000.

00:44:17.365 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Including the solar
panels and the wind turbine?

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Including the solar panels
and the wind turbine, yep.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you say is the
percentage of power that you

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.802 align:middle line:84%
get from wind and the
percentage of power--

00:44:25.802 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, we probably get about
10% from wind and about 70% from

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:90%
solar and about--

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:39.300 align:middle line:84%
the other 20% from
our backup generator.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You can use a generator.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
qualm about using it.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But we are aware that it costs
money to fly the fuel in.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Fuel costs money by itself.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And all these gizmos and
gadgets have a lifespan.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:00.680 align:middle line:90%
So let's maximize that lifespan.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:84%
If we don't need to fire
up the generator, we won't.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I've met a few people
who live off-the-grid.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.580 align:middle line:10%
There's one not
too far from here--

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.780 align:middle line:10%
a big system, big, big system.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:10%
Huge system, really.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:10%
His whole roof is covered
with solar panels.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And he should have
all kinds of power.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I went to go see
this huge, wonderful system,

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.090 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't even watch TV.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you watch TV?

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, it's
not very sunny today.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
enough electricity.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Where does it all go?

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.030 align:middle line:84%
He's got a central
heating system,

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and he uses electricity to
run his hot water pumps.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:84%
He's got three hot
water circulating pumps.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.740 align:middle line:90%
What in the world are you doing?

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And he heats the
water with wood.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:84%
If you had a decent stove in
the basement, a wood furnace

in the basement,
for crying out loud,

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.090 align:middle line:84%
you could heat your whole
house and your electricity

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.950 align:middle line:90%
could be put to better uses.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Water pumps?

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Constant hot water?

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.350 align:middle line:84%
It just-- some people have
the idea, but like you say,

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm lucky.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:12.650 align:middle line:90%
I can rationalize things.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Our son challenged us a bit--

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.950 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.445 align:middle line:10%
He went to an outdoor

00:46:18.445 --> 00:46:19.570 align:middle line:10%
when he was in high school.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:25.438 align:middle line:10%
And when he came back,
his mantra was if it's--

00:46:25.438 --> 00:46:26.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Yellow, let it mellow.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.605 align:middle line:90%
>> --yellow, let it mellow.

00:46:27.605 --> 00:46:29.105 align:middle line:90%
If it's brown, flush it down.

00:46:29.105 --> 00:46:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a tank
up on the hill.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.740 align:middle line:84%
We'll show you
when we go outside.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's buried
so it doesn't freeze.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's probably level with
the upstairs floor, which

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:44.568 align:middle line:10%
doesn't really give
enough pressure

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:10%
for normal pressure in a house.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But the less pressure you
have, the less water you use.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we do--

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.532 align:middle line:90%
hundred pumps a day.

00:46:53.532 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Hundred pumps a day?

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Each.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Each.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.500 align:middle line:84%
About like that, and it
comes through the pipe,

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.980 align:middle line:84%
down into big-- it's
an old milk truck tank.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.934 align:middle line:90%
And that's what feeds the house.

00:47:08.934 --> 00:47:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:15.167 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's made to
go into a drilled well.

00:47:15.167 --> 00:47:16.500 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's long and skinny.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.668 align:middle line:90%
It hit the top of the water now.

00:47:23.668 --> 00:47:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wait till it fills up.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --and when it fills,
you'll hear the "glurb."

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.390 align:middle line:90%

[WATER GURGLES]

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:33.338 align:middle line:90%
And then it's full.

00:47:33.338 --> 00:47:35.250 align:middle line:90%
So then you pull back up.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:41.950 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:90%
And then you pull the trigger.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.485 align:middle line:84%
It shoots down your
water that quickly.

00:47:51.485 --> 00:47:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's not too hard to do.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.605 align:middle line:90%
Quick.

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.063 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
quicker than actually

00:47:56.063 --> 00:47:58.541 align:middle line:84%
sitting here and priming
the well for like 15 minutes

00:47:58.541 --> 00:48:01.083 align:middle line:84%
and then finally, a little bit
of water starts trickling out.

where they have bulk water.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.160 align:middle line:10%
It costs me $2 every time I--

to fill my 300 gallon tank--

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.460 align:middle line:10%
typically about once a week.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Once a week?

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It depends how many-- if we
have guests, it's more frequent.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And if I have to fill the
hot tub, it's more frequent.

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.140 align:middle line:84%
For the price it would cost
me to drill a well here,

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I can buy a truck and
haul water for 10 years.

>> What we do in here
is we heat the water,

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.040 align:middle line:90%
or we put little fires--

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.590 align:middle line:84%

heat the water on top.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is boiling, essentially.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And we take cold water and
then we add it and we feel it.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's, hmm, that
feels about right.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you put it up there
in that little thing there.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And you take a shower, which
is about five gallons of water

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.090 align:middle line:90%
or less, really.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:51.790 align:middle line:90%

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So I usually sit and
take a shower, actually.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.480 align:middle line:10%
But--

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:10%
>> These can be self-serviced,
so we can fix them ourselves.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:10%
All the insides are
stainless steel,

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.550 align:middle line:10%
so they're going to
last for a long time.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:06.130 align:middle line:10%
And they were made
on this continent.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I've just been amazed by this
because it's super low energy

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.920 align:middle line:90%
and super low water use.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It works for us because it's
got a separate wash side from

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.380 align:middle line:90%
spin.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:22.100 align:middle line:10%
So you can wash a load, spin it,
and aim the water back in here

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.430 align:middle line:10%
so you can do your
second load.4 you don't

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.872 align:middle line:10%
do a second load of whites
because the water's got

00:49:26.872 --> 00:49:28.330 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of
dirt in it by then.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But I do three or four
loads using the same water.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When this gets filled up,
you take it outside and dump it.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really use
any kind of fake chemicals

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.750 align:middle line:90%
too much, so we--

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:84%
we just put it different
places all the time.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't really feel like
that's necessarily a bad thing.

sink, the kitchen sink,

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:90%
treated, if you want.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I use something
nasty in the sink, which

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I try not to do.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.940 align:middle line:84%
It will go into
the septic system.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like a gray
water situation.

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.360 align:middle line:84%

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:12.670 align:middle line:84%

and you'll see with
our outhouse, too--

00:50:14.295 --> 00:50:16.337 align:middle line:84%
is that it's our own waste,
you know what I mean?

00:50:16.337 --> 00:50:18.712 align:middle line:84%
We have the responsibility of
dealing with our own waste.

00:50:18.712 --> 00:50:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we die from it,
it's our own fault.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.107 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that people are so
afraid of poop and not at all

00:50:23.107 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:90%
afraid of chlorine bleach.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It just blows my mind.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:90%

>> This outhouse is
basically just a compost box,

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.160 align:middle line:10%
or it's really a few
compost boxes in a row.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.530 align:middle line:84%
When the first area
fills up, I just

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.390 align:middle line:90%
shovel it into the second area.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:59.373 align:middle line:90%
This is non-scientific.

00:50:59.373 --> 00:51:00.790 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
really into it,

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:03.370 align:middle line:84%
people buy the composting
ones with the rolling drum

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and things like that and
throwing peat moss in.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Then you're making
serious composts.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:12.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So underneath the
house is a big tank.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:17.590 align:middle line:10%
And it has a handle
on it for raking.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.380 align:middle line:90%
So everything goes in there.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Every day, you put a cup
of peat moss down it--

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't done
yet today, so I'll do

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.760 align:middle line:90%
that for your benefit as well.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It just goes down in there.

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And every day, you
give that handle

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.720 align:middle line:84%
on the tank outside
a little rake.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And the gadgets inside
of it aerate it.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We dug a big hole, and then
we built our outhouse over

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:48.190 align:middle line:90%
the hole.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.690 align:middle line:10%
And we made this
so you can actually

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.270 align:middle line:10%
pick this up and move this.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The whole thing comes off.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:52.805 align:middle line:10%
>> And the whole
thing comes off.

00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.370 align:middle line:10%
And so when it's
full and we start

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:10%
getting what we
call a stalagshite,

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.910 align:middle line:10%
which is actually--

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:59.133 align:middle line:10%
but you know what I mean?

00:51:59.133 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we pull this
off and we take a shovel,

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.240 align:middle line:90%
and we put it in a wheelbarrow.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.907 align:middle line:84%
We take it, and we
go dump it somewhere.

00:52:03.907 --> 00:52:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> In the woods or--

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.275 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can't even recognize
it as poop at that point.

00:52:07.275 --> 00:52:09.597 align:middle line:84%
It looks like some kind of
dirt or something like that.

00:52:09.597 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is the product.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.290 align:middle line:10%
It's a fantastic product.

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:15.160 align:middle line:10%
It really works great when
you've got everything on.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:10%
Smells like dirt.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.176 align:middle line:10%
Just like dirt.

00:52:18.176 --> 00:52:18.976 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:52:18.976 --> 00:52:20.707 align:middle line:10%
It's good topsoil.

00:52:20.707 --> 00:52:23.040 align:middle line:10%
>> You can get these plastic
composting ones that people

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.080 align:middle line:10%
keep under their
kitchen counter.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.672 align:middle line:84%
So this is how I
found out about this.

00:52:26.672 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Somebody brought me these
worms, and I thought, well,

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.745 align:middle line:84%
that's just sort of neat,
how they eat everything.

00:52:31.745 --> 00:52:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I thought,
I wonder if they'll eat shit?

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:90%
So I took a crap in a worm bin.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was amazed.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Like in four days, it was gone.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Gone.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Completely gone.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, I'm
onto something here.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.193 align:middle line:84%
So then I started setting
up systems for it.

00:52:44.193 --> 00:52:46.978 align:middle line:90%
And now it's ubiquitous.

00:52:46.978 --> 00:52:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Then the cycle begins again.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.133 align:middle line:90%
You eat your--

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so it's
a back and forth.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:53.378 align:middle line:90%


00:52:53.378 --> 00:52:55.354 align:middle line:90%
You can do it forever.

always dreamed of doing ever

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.010 align:middle line:90%
since I was a teenager.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.410 align:middle line:10%
And I've been lucky enough
to be able to do it--

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:12.290 align:middle line:10%
to sit down to the table and
90% of what's on the table

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:16.290 align:middle line:10%
is stuff that you
grew or made yourself.

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And you're not depending
on the grocery store.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
depending on some farmer

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.900 align:middle line:84%
in California and that
whole distribution system.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a huge garden out
there, a vegetable garden.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.040 align:middle line:10%
And I always manage to
find the time for that.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.710 align:middle line:10%
I do a lot of
canning and pickling

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:10%
and those sorts of things.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.120 align:middle line:10%
So I actually can
have my headphone on

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.180 align:middle line:10%
and be doing a business
meeting, and I'm

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.580 align:middle line:10%
pickling at the same time.

00:54:53.580 --> 00:55:02.045 align:middle line:84%
>> See carrots,
tomatoes, beans, peas.

00:55:02.045 --> 00:55:02.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Juices.

00:55:02.845 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Normally we would have corn,
juices, tomato soup, tomato--

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sauce.

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> --sauce, tomato--

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Stewed tomatoes.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> This year, we had a crop
failure of potatoes because we

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:90%
had a flood.

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's not many
potatoes in here.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.700 align:middle line:10%
But we have a lot of
canned goods in here--

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.750 align:middle line:10%
strawberry jam, raspberry
jam, Saskatoon jam,

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of fruit.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Saskatoons, raspberries,
strawberries.

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I do, of course, buy
a few peaches and things too.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
we should probably

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.000 align:middle line:84%
take some fruit into
the house anyways

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.976 align:middle line:90%
to have for lunch maybe.

>> That's hot water for my
sauce for my dinner and--

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, so there's a
pot of hot water there?

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
boil some pasta as well.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:45.178 align:middle line:84%
Usually I can say I have
three hot meals a day.

00:56:45.178 --> 00:56:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But today, because it was
so cloudy this morning,

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.375 align:middle line:90%
I only had two.

00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I had lunch and dinner.

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.080 align:middle line:84%
They reflect the sun
into this insulated box.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how much
power the sun has.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to
get it up to 300.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Today when it was cloudy,
they were about 150.

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And if I was to really--

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.510 align:middle line:84%
like in the middle of the
day, and if I was really

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:20.400 align:middle line:84%
focused on focusing these, I
could get it up to 350 to 400.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Organizing and planning
is really important.

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:27.870 align:middle line:10%
And so if I'm going to have
something frozen at night,

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:29.970 align:middle line:10%
I take it out in the morning.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:30.990 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't really--

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:32.550 align:middle line:10%
she doesn't even eat meat.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.250 align:middle line:10%
So we don't-- that's one thing
that we don't-- and I think

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:10%
that if you make a--

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.930 align:middle line:10%
>> If I make something for
him that's frozen meat,

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.950 align:middle line:10%
then I cook it from frozen.

For two people, and one
person doesn't eat meat,

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:45.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to make a turkey.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.827 align:middle line:84%
If he wants turkey, he can
have it at the neighbors.

00:57:47.827 --> 00:57:53.250 align:middle line:10%
>> So what we do is, instead
of growing our own meat now,

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:58.420 align:middle line:10%
every two years, we fly in
a side of beef and we fly

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.960 align:middle line:10%
in a whole pig, frozen.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we still do our
own cutting, wrapping.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.140 align:middle line:90%
We make our own sausages.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:11.205 align:middle line:84%
We smoke and cure our
own bacons and hams.

00:58:11.205 --> 00:58:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the
bowels of the beast.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.620 align:middle line:84%
We can keep potatoes
through the wintertime

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.090 align:middle line:90%
even if we weren't here.

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:29.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the wine that we make.

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And we thought if you guys
are into a little bit of wine,

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.258 align:middle line:84%
we could have some
wine for dinner.

00:58:38.258 --> 00:58:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't you get bored?

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> So how do you not get bored?

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> My biggest hobby
is woodworking.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And I woodwork the old-fashioned
way-- with hand tools.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:59:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The wintertime,
it's more indoor stuff.

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:11.940 align:middle line:84%
For me, it might be sewing,
quilting, knitting, spinning,

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:12.740 align:middle line:90%
weaving.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, any--

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.228 align:middle line:90%
I love doing any that stuff.

00:59:16.228 --> 00:59:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The one next to the
vent, the higher one,

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:47.340 align:middle line:90%
is the TV satellite.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the one that's
all close to the porch

00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:53.775 align:middle line:84%
is the internet
satellite system.

00:59:53.775 --> 00:59:56.150 align:middle line:84%
When we built the house, that
was one of the first things

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:58.890 align:middle line:90%
that we put in was the TV.

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we've
only met, one, two,

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:08.040 align:middle line:84%
three people that didn't have
the internet in their home.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.740 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
we've only met

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.180 align:middle line:84%
a handful of people that
have a TV, satellite,

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.920 align:middle line:90%
or cable subscription.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:22.056 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering why you decided to
have TV when you're so remote?

01:00:22.056 --> 01:00:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>> For the entertainment value.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not big on the
soaps and stuff like that.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't
watch them at all.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But the educational TV is
something that we do enjoy.

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.750 align:middle line:90%
So we watch a couple--

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:39.680 align:middle line:90%
three hours a day.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.550 align:middle line:10%
I mean--

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.620 align:middle line:10%
>> When you're alone in
this place in the middle

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.460 align:middle line:10%
of the winter and it's minus 30
outside, you're going no place.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.110 align:middle line:10%
You're staying at home
watching TV, or you're reading.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:51.660 align:middle line:10%
I read a lot.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't watch TV unless it's
Saturday night and the hockey

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.780 align:middle line:90%
game's on.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:01.682 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I'm grinding flour

01:01:01.682 --> 01:01:03.800 align:middle line:90%
on an exercise bike.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's my compromise
with the devil.

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm consuming our
energy, in a sense,

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.310 align:middle line:90%
frivolously using the energy.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I'm saying, well,

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to be
so darn frivolous,

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:19.520 align:middle line:90%
then I better grind some grain.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's
what Nan told me.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLE]

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Quite honestly, there's
nothing on television worth

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.063 align:middle line:10%
watching.

01:01:25.063 --> 01:01:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And I just got so that
I wasn't even using it.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.910 align:middle line:10%
And one day I stopped
and I thought, jeez,

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.580 align:middle line:10%
that thing hasn't been
on for at least a year.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Why am I even
bothering to dust it?

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:36.200 align:middle line:90%
And so I threw it out.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Television is always pushing.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:48.680 align:middle line:10%
I use the internet for emails
and for looking things up.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.200 align:middle line:90%


01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I go there, and
if I want the news,

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll go to Al Jazeera or
BBC or someplace like that--

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
not Fox News or
someplace like that--

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and read the news.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And then they turn it off.

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The computer is kind of like
a crescent wrench for me.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a tool.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:32.100 align:middle line:90%


01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I run the Lotus
Center in St. John's.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's a yoga and
meditation center,

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and lots of
spiritual activities.

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And when I met Ian--

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:43.970 align:middle line:10%
I've been always looking
for a place to do a retreat.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:46.470 align:middle line:10%
And Ian has been--

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:48.870 align:middle line:10%
he has this land out
here, and he's wondering

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.860 align:middle line:10%
what he's going to do with it.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:57.540 align:middle line:10%
So the two of us got together
and brainstormed this vision.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:01.050 align:middle line:90%
We have the meditation hut.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And that has two
accommodations in there.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And we also have the new bunk
house that we're building.

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.590 align:middle line:10%
So that will
accommodate 12 people.

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have someone
coming for the day,

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
someone coming for the weekend.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people stay
for a week or two.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have
a work exchange

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
where people come out
and work, and they stay

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.410 align:middle line:90%
for accommodation and food.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Miranda brought more of
the people aspect to it.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing more the nature and
building since my training was

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.110 align:middle line:90%
in science.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:38.700 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> When I lived in India,
it was a lifestyle.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a spiritual lifestyle.

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't really a business.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
When I came back to
the West, Canada,

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
it was like looking around and
saying everything's a business.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything's in terms
of making a living

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.548 align:middle line:84%
and how to design it so that
$1 comes out at the end of it.

01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:03.840 align:middle line:10%
I had to get my head around it.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.490 align:middle line:10%
For several years, I had
to get my head around it.

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:09.710 align:middle line:10%
But I came with a desire
to create community.

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The freedom of waking up in
the morning and you don't have

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.525 align:middle line:90%
to be somewhere else.

01:04:15.525 --> 01:04:17.868 align:middle line:90%


01:04:17.868 --> 01:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
You've still got a
lot on your plate,

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe, that you want to
touch down on that day.

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to company
B and putting in your day.

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
You're just waking up
and you can choose what

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.920 align:middle line:90%
it is you're going to work on.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When we first did this, we
didn't really have to get a job

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
because we had money from
the sale of our other stuff.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.637 align:middle line:10%
But that quickly ran out
over a period of time.

01:04:39.637 --> 01:04:40.470 align:middle line:10%
We built everything.

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:41.345 align:middle line:10%
We bought everything.

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:43.830 align:middle line:10%
So we really didn't
have any bills.

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.503 align:middle line:84%
But we got to the
point where we knew

01:04:45.503 --> 01:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
we were going to have to
do something for an income.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And we always thought
the whole time, well,

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
when that comes, why don't we
see if we can't sell what we

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.370 align:middle line:90%
love, which is our lifestyle.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:55.600 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it kind of did.

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And she does-- you can see a
lot of the things that she does.

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:00.780 align:middle line:90%
She has a website.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And she does shows
and she sells crafts

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.220 align:middle line:90%
and art and stuff like that.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Friday I should be getting
my very first old-age pension

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.090 align:middle line:10%
check.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.320 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know how much
they've cut my Canada pension--

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.940 align:middle line:10%
Quebec pension, pardon me.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm getting yet.

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
It might turn out to
be so little that I

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.480 align:middle line:90%
can't afford to stay here.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Nan retired in 1976,
worked part-time on occasion.

01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:26.820 align:middle line:10%
Was always very
supportive of me when

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.310 align:middle line:10%
I needed help, which was daily.

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:31.525 align:middle line:10%
>> [CHUCKLE]

01:05:31.525 --> 01:05:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And the kids, the three kids.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Nan had time to pretty
well go full-time at this

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
as I tried to keep my
job and pitch in here.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that a couple
who both work full-time could

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.940 align:middle line:90%
live off-the-grid?

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Off-the-grid, yes.

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
But not quite like we do.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you're going
to go the extra step,

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:55.950 align:middle line:90%
then it takes a rare family.

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You need two partners
who are raring to go.

01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You do need a second person
and a supportive family.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:09.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you think it's easier for
men than for women to deal with

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:10.320 align:middle line:10%
some of these things?

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Yep.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.182 align:middle line:10%
>> You think so, eh?

01:06:12.182 --> 01:06:13.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe women need
to pee more often.

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:18.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The women's community,
I found to be very strong,

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.840 align:middle line:10%
which is, I think, pretty
different compared to many Gulf

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.640 align:middle line:10%
Islands.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.400 align:middle line:10%
The ones I'm familiar with
are Saturna and Galiano.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, there
are strong women there.

01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But I found a lot of
patriarchy, like overts--

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
really in-your-face
patriarchy there as well.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So this place has that as well,
but not to the same degree,

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I think.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:49.112 align:middle line:84%
And the women are very
much more prominent,

01:06:49.112 --> 01:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I guess, in the
community, I think.

01:06:50.570 --> 01:07:13.660 align:middle line:90%


01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Our youngest daughter was
going into grade 9 when we

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.720 align:middle line:90%
moved out.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And she had a bit of
a challenge because we

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
were leaving a place that
was ideal for a teenager.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take her
very long to adapt.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And she soon felt proud
to bring her friends out

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
here and show them what
we did that was different.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It took her a bit
longer to figure out

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't change
your jeans every day

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people who do
this still want to live like

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:52.590 align:middle line:10%
they're in the city or in the
country with big power supply.

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.220 align:middle line:10%
So they want to live
off-grid, but they

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.260 align:middle line:10%
don't want anything to change
in terms of their lifestyle.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:02.000 align:middle line:10%
So that's what's
different about us

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.040 align:middle line:10%
without taking
ourselves too seriously.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%


01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Here, we live
in North America.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And you just walk into a home
that's been built for us.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:23.069 align:middle line:84%
We really wanted to experience
what it was like to actually

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:25.178 align:middle line:90%
do it all yourself.

01:08:25.178 --> 01:08:26.970 align:middle line:10%
And I'd always had a
dream as a little girl

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:31.800 align:middle line:10%
to live on "Old
MacDonald Had a Farm."

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:35.330 align:middle line:10%
That was my dream.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I wanted very, very much
to work with the horses.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was
logging with them.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
We bought two horses that were
made to pull logs out of woods.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of us had any
experience in building,

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:55.350 align:middle line:90%
in logging with horses.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd ridden all my life, but
I've never been behind a horse

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.590 align:middle line:90%
and driven a horse with a cart.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:04.330 align:middle line:90%
We have 150 acres.

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was,
A, we would never

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
have to cut down a live tree
because there was enough dead

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%
fall out there.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:17.439 align:middle line:84%
We did that for the first
three or four years.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:21.819 align:middle line:84%
The biggest issue that we
are dealing with right now,

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
because we couldn't financially
keep it going as an ecotourism

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
establishment, we are now left
with the burden of the fallout.

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We just didn't have the
numbers of people that you

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:41.720 align:middle line:84%
needed during the tourist season
to be able to maintain that

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
type of lifestyle.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:44.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's only
two months of the year.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:46.609 align:middle line:90%
You've got July and August.

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And you can't make the money.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do it.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So either you have to have
money to live off-the-grid,

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
to own outright your property
and have no mortgage.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
So we couldn't do it.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.285 align:middle line:90%
We just couldn't do it.

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:07.240 align:middle line:90%


01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So enter working
off the farm.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Judy's working off
the farm as a cook.

01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm working off the farm
right now as a security

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.150 align:middle line:90%
guard at a hospital.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
That changes the whole
off-grid situation.

01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We were functioning
with the weather before.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't function
like that now.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we come home
and we want things.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've got four
hours, then I have

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.920 align:middle line:90%
to either sleep or go to work.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.360 align:middle line:90%
So we use more power.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Now it becomes a
major pain in the ass.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In one sense, you
have to weigh the ethical

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
or the ideological
side to the practical.

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Our other option,
and this is very

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
ironic, is that Jim go out
west to work as a driver for--

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oil sands.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --oil sands.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The big part of what's
next is we will be on-grid.

01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If Jim were able to go out
west, first thing we would do--

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
would probably take us $20,000
to get the lines in and then

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
get a system going whereby I
can have running hot water and I

01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
can have a little propane
stove with an oven here.

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:23.460 align:middle line:10%
I have to have some
easier option here.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The people I work with just
cannot possibly understand how

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I've survived this long.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
They have spent the last 50
years getting away from this.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want
to go back to this.

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Whether you live
off-the-grid or on-the-grid,

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.440 align:middle line:90%
you still deal with life.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And life can be very,
very roller coastery.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.520 align:middle line:90%
We love it here.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who wouldn't?

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:51.060 align:middle line:90%
This is paradise.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a little piece of heaven.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
We have no issues
with neighbors.

01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
We have 150 acres
surrounding us.

01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I can have my horses
in my backyard.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I can look out my window.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the most complicated
life I've ever lived.

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's the truth.

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt more
stressed than I feel today.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:24.610 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:28.960 align:middle line:10%
>> The thing about it is
everybody comes here with

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.000 align:middle line:10%
a dream.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.480 align:middle line:10%
And after about
four to six months,

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.980 align:middle line:10%
they find out that
the dream doesn't fit.

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the smart ones
change the dream,

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're the
ones that stay here.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
The ones that try to make
this place fit their dream

01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%
usually don't stick around.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
The learning curve for
somebody moving out of the city

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
coming to this place
is straight up.

01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Straight up.

01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
understand plumbing.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
understand basic wiring.

01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Every coffee table
in the suburbs

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
has got country life on
it with glossy photographs

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
of all these gorgeous
houses full of antiques

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and knickknacks.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.507 align:middle line:84%
And they have this
notion that that's

01:13:21.507 --> 01:13:22.840 align:middle line:90%
the way you live in the country.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, you bloody well don't.

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's got the time
to dust that shit.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:36.470 align:middle line:90%


01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> My grandfather and
I were very close.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the one he told
all his stories to.

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
He left me the
island with a promise

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to do my best to keep it in
the family or protect it.

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's the promise
that I've kept.

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
When I used to stay out
here with my grandparents

01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s, '60s, they had
a very small grid system.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So every house, I don't know if
it was 60 amps, 80 amps tops--

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%
very small electrical services.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.200 align:middle line:10%
So when the neighbor down the
street turned on their toaster,

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.100 align:middle line:10%
your TV went like this.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:13.140 align:middle line:10%
You understood there was
a limited amount of power.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:16.680 align:middle line:10%
And now there's no demand
metering on residents.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
There's no feedback loop.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
You can use any amount
of power you want.

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:22.880 align:middle line:10%
You can run all your
electric heaters at once.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.200 align:middle line:10%
You're going to get a bill.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.750 align:middle line:10%
Price is a great factor.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:29.420 align:middle line:10%
But in a way, it
means that if price

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.180 align:middle line:10%
is the only control
of consumption,

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.890 align:middle line:10%
it just means that wealthy
people can use a whole bunch

01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:36.020 align:middle line:10%
because they can afford to.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I find interesting
with human behavior

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
is that if people can access
the power, they'll use it.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
If they can't, they'll
take it to the limit

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and then go, oh,
that's the limit.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.500 align:middle line:10%
>> If you bring
a paradigm where,

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.330 align:middle line:10%
I want to convert my city
house to being off-the-grid,

01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:56.900 align:middle line:10%
and I want my dishwasher and
my dryer and my washing machine

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.040 align:middle line:10%
and blah, blah, blah.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's all
fine if you've got

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.170 align:middle line:10%
$45,000 to spend
on a power system

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:05.990 align:middle line:10%
to run your house renewably.

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
All that you've proven is
that a person with $45,000

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
can live off-the-grid just
like we live on-the-grid.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
That is not really
progress in my mind.

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:24.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Do we want people in the city
to be independent with respect

01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:27.620 align:middle line:10%
in electrical generation?

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:33.880 align:middle line:10%
Or do we want them to take
ownership and understanding?

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing I would say
to someone who wanted to live

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
off-the-grid is first turn
everything off and live without

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
electricity for as
long as you dare.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you will
have a starting place

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
from which to truly appreciate
what it is to be off-grid.

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, you
could start by, for example,

01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
buying a small solar panel and
a car battery or something.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
now I'm going to live

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:07.220 align:middle line:90%
on what I can make with this.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I think there's something
deeply rooted in what it means

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.430 align:middle line:10%
to be human, to have the
connection between being

01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:19.970 align:middle line:10%
productive and having stuff.

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:23.150 align:middle line:10%
In our society, that
connection has become tenuous.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
You get a paycheck,
but it's very hard

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to see what you're doing
in your office actually

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.110 align:middle line:90%
connects to producing anything.

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
For me, to be in a
physical environment

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
where taking care of
stuff, making sure

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that I have wood for
the winter, making sure

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that the various systems
are working properly, that I

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:43.130 align:middle line:90%
have to take care of them.

01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I invest in those things,
then my needs are satisfied.

01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Seeing that connection,
I think, is--

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
there's something deeply
healthy about that.

01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:56.600 align:middle line:90%


01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it doable?

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course it is.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
We can do anything that
we set our minds to.

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:03.860 align:middle line:10%
Anything.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.260 align:middle line:10%
I built my house.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.400 align:middle line:10%
I live off-grid.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Some people do amazing things.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people do
amazing things.

01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But are there enough
people who think it's

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:19.330 align:middle line:90%
worth it to save the planet?

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you step outside
of this little closed group,

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.400 align:middle line:84%
you notice that there
is an ocean of people

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
who have no clue and
who are not interested.

01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
On my bad days, I think
humans are a parasite

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and the earth will get
rid of us sooner or later.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't bother me at all.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's being fanned fast
and furious by the television

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
they want you to do.

01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
They want you to
consume and work.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the mandate of our
civilization is to destroy

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
the planet as quick as possible.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds silly, but
that explains everything.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
it all comes from.

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:04.560 align:middle line:10%
The drive to just have
it all now regardless

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.600 align:middle line:10%
of the consequences.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.715 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of system
that we're operating under.

01:18:08.715 --> 01:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the collective
consciousness

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:11.270 align:middle line:90%
in the civilization.

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:15.680 align:middle line:10%
People as a-- humanity
as a conglomerate entity

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.665 align:middle line:10%
is like on this trip where we're
going to just trash everything

01:18:18.665 --> 01:18:19.790 align:middle line:10%
until there's nothing left.

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's nobody
that can stop it.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It'll have to stop itself.

01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And it will.

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.447 align:middle line:90%
Things will change.

01:18:26.447 --> 01:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be pretty,
but they will change.

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%


01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what's got
lost in a lot of this.

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:42.850 align:middle line:10%
And I worry that those that have
lost all the skills of taking

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:46.990 align:middle line:10%
care of themselves and
having to actually work

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:50.320 align:middle line:10%
in harmony with nature
in order to survive,

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.370 align:middle line:10%
that there's going to
be such a mass of people

01:18:54.370 --> 01:18:57.490 align:middle line:10%
that don't get it at all.

01:18:57.490 --> 01:19:00.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I had 20 years in
federal government.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.500 align:middle line:10%
And after a while,
you just sort of come

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:06.040 align:middle line:10%
to understand that all of
this process that we have

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.200 align:middle line:10%
in our society that's
supposed to make

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.780 align:middle line:10%
this a better place
for environment

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.250 align:middle line:10%
is not really working.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.422 align:middle line:84%
And that you are
inside of a system.

01:19:16.422 --> 01:19:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're in there
initially because you

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:20.200 align:middle line:90%
think you can change it.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.760 align:middle line:10%
>> It was the corporate world
that really opened my eyes

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.470 align:middle line:10%
to just how little
the corporations care.

01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:31.090 align:middle line:90%
For example, our food.

01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
our food comes from.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And the only time that the
corporations will do anything

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.430 align:middle line:84%
in a green sense is if
the people push for it.

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:44.170 align:middle line:10%
>> We need to stop buying
energy from utilities,

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:48.520 align:middle line:10%
from fuel companies, from coal
companies at such ridiculously,

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.950 align:middle line:10%
heavily subsidized rates.

01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
If there were real prices
for the energy we use,

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
renewable energy would
be a screaming bargain

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and people would be banging
down the doors to buy it.

01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:03.250 align:middle line:90%
However, as long as--

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
it's cheap to take a mountain
top off some poor chunk

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.810 align:middle line:84%
of Virginia or Pennsylvania
or North Carolina

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and profitable and subsidized
by a variety of business

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.700 align:middle line:90%
interests.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.530 align:middle line:90%
We'll hear about clean coal.

01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll see wonderful ads about
what a great idea fracking is--

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
until we start paying for
poisoning people's wells.

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we start paying
those real costs,

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
we'll see a real change in
perception and usage of energy.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.000 align:middle line:90%


01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We've taken that wonderful
concept of North America

01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:58.110 align:middle line:84%
pioneering and entrepreneurial
spirit and we adopted it

01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to our hearts as
back to the earthers.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur
to us, that, perhaps,

01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:11.550 align:middle line:90%
was colossally selfish.

01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:16.987 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
reason four families

01:21:16.987 --> 01:21:18.195 align:middle line:90%
couldn't share this property.

01:21:18.195 --> 01:21:20.700 align:middle line:90%


01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And in most parts of
the world, they would.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We live in a place where we
have the ability and the soil

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and water resources to grow
the majority of our food.

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Our heat energy comes from
trees that grow on our property.

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:42.195 align:middle line:84%
Our electricity
falls out of the sky.

01:21:42.195 --> 01:21:45.040 align:middle line:90%


01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:51.960 align:middle line:84%
We have the luxury of being
largely independent from what's

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
going on economically or
socially in the world.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.290 align:middle line:90%


01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
This, in true North American
terms, is a colossal luxury.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with that?

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:12.240 align:middle line:90%


01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
We can't afford to have
three billion people being

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:16.670 align:middle line:90%
that luxurious.

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:31.670 align:middle line:90%
