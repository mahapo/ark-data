What we can achieve by

own limitations.

Either it can give up, or
it can decide for itself

something that the mind,

I've often felt like I'm
on a shamanic journey,

very much like that.

spiritual awakening be

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:90%
a collective process?

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Can the world go through
a similar process

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:84%
as an individual might go in
their own personal journey?

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is,
potentially, yes.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>> It's quite common
for deep transformations

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:10%

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:10%
And that, in fact, is what we

Here's one of my favorites.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:10%
It's that we are
entering the moment when

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:10%
Darwin's theory of evolution
is no longer correct,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:10%
in this sense.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Our decisions now are
more fundamental even

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
than natural selection
in shaping the earth.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:10%
We live in that
time in a crossover,

when our human consciousness
and the decisions it's making

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:10%
becomes the primary shaping
force of all of life.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The universe evolved in
a certain way up to us,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and now we are going to
change the actual evolution

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:90%

So a day or two after

I had a profound
moment of surrender.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:90%
It came very easily.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%

completely, and it helped

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
me have that deep sense of
surrender to something larger.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I had a preconception
that surrendering

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
meant peace of mind.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly did

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
feel grief and fear

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and still be in the
state of surrender,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:84%
just to let go of the individual
struggle, to let go of control

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:90%
and to let go, to let go?

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We can only create something
different when we let go,

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.180 align:middle line:84%
but it requires a kind of
surrendering and an opening out

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to something vaster,
within which we all exist,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
within which all this creation
is continuously happening,

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
because then something different
begins to incarnate in us

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and we become the instruments
for a different kind

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:90%

comes at the process.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
How can we make our
evolution, which we witness,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:90%
a matter of conscious pursuit?

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Can we not work
upon processes so

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that we feel that drive we
have leading a life which

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:84%
is directed consciously,
which is not tumbling along

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:90%
by the force of circumstance?

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The previous step from
the animal to the man,

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the animal did not have the
kind of mind that could provide

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the aspiration and that could
provide a conscious help

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:90%
to the process.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So that was largely an
involuntary process.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Now we can make it
a voluntary process,

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and the more we make
it a voluntary process,

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I think, the faster it will go.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Now when we deliberately
wish to contact the higher

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:06.360 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, it is necessary,
then, to point in the mind.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And a developed mind that
knows its limitations

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:84%
is a willing partner in
the widening of itself.

large scale ideas of synthesis

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing hangs together.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So that is our most
urgent task at the moment,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:84%
how to get the
consciousness that

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
is in harmony with the
consciousness of the world.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
You get a tremendous
joy of individual life.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
All that joy of
existence is there

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
because we have that
individualized consciousness.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to go
to the stage where

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
it becomes also
harmonious, so that we

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
have the beauty of
the harmony and also

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
the joy of that individuality.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:10%
And one way of doing that is
just getting the basic idea

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:10%
that our lives don't
have, actually,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:10%
much of an external
purpose, but are largely

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:10%
for us to change in
our consciousness,

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:10%
slowly becoming wiser,
becoming more in harmony

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.225 align:middle line:10%
with the consciousness that
supports this immensely

00:33:03.225 --> 00:33:04.025 align:middle line:10%
complex creation.

00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So it is an unlucky in-between
stage that we are in,

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:90%
but it is an in-between stage.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It is not a final thing.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:10%
>> We've done it this way to the
point of destroying ourselves

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:10%
and destroying the earth.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we can do
it differently.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we can look
at it in another way.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the contribution
of a creative person can do.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.300 align:middle line:84%
They like to look at everything
from a different angle, out

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:84%
of the box, looking at it
from a different perspective.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Artistic expression
of the creative mind.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:90%
The creative mind that is vast.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The creative mind
that is limitless.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot progress
without the creative mind.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.276 align:middle line:84%
The function of art is to help
us evolve as human beings.

>> Artists, in their artistic
reverie and using imagination,

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:29.464 align:middle line:84%
look down the time track
and sense what we can be.

00:34:29.464 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Artists have always
been this way.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:84%

to a process of unfolding

of inner phenomenon.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Then I have an opportunity to
get in touch with something

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that is much bigger than
myself, much bigger than what

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.389 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness
can even comprehend.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:35:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that everything
that we've ever invented,

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:07.792 align:middle line:84%
every art, has come from
another state of consciousness.

00:35:07.792 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not going to
just be copyists and copy

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.130 align:middle line:84%
whatever art everybody
else is doing,

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:84%
we have to let go
and find the means

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to enter into
that ocean of consciousness.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's from that place
that the art comes.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The ingredient
is the open mind.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Being open to surprise.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, this openness might bring
a lot of fear for some people

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's a fear
of the unknown.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.160 align:middle line:84%
What is going to happen,
is submitting oneself

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to the mystery of
what might happen.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.448 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The best of art,
certainly, is spiritual.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It actually, I think,
comes from the source.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The highest artistic
performance, I think,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is a situation where the
artist is really channel

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
for cosmic creative energy.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And the highest forms of art,
I think, are definitely divine.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:84%
They're coming
from divine source.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not human made
in the ordinary sense.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Mozart, whole
symphonies appeared

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:10%
in a finished form in his head.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:10%
He just ha to write it down.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Or Puccini said I didn't
write Madame Butterfly.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I was just holding the pen.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It was created by God.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> When we as humans experience
a piece of art that has come

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:84%
from that state, we
know it instantly.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It registers in that
place within us.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.042 align:middle line:84%
>> It becomes a means for us
to have a spiritual experience.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, witnessing some
kind of beautiful piece

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:84%
of architecture like Taj
Mahal or Gothic cathedral

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and listening to
a piece of music,

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
those are all
activities, I think,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that can induce spiritual
experiences in a very, very

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:90%
powerful way.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It was both coming
from the divine source

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:90%
but also mediating access to it.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a kind of spiritual
experience that one can have

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that feels ultimately real.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:52.030 align:middle line:84%
That feels-- some experience
of the spirit, a sense

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:90%
of infinite consciousness.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And we need to take a higher
step in the evolution.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to a spiritual
consciousness, something which

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
is going to be truly able
to comprehend the unity that

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
underlies us, and
it's not just simply

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:84%
to escape out of
the world, but it

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.090 align:middle line:84%
is to be an embodied
spiritual consciousness

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.100 align:middle line:90%
here in the world.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Spirituality, I think
it's a very private affair

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that
depends on experience.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on recognition
of our higher nature.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Somehow we are more
than we think we are.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:84%
We can experience ourselves as
something much larger and much

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.190 align:middle line:84%
higher, much more
beautiful than we

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:84%
are aware of in our everyday
state of consciousness.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There are actually
different ways of finding that

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that goes beyond
our ordinary consciousness.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:10%
All spiritual traditions have
talked about those things,

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:10%
and we can get to a space that
is impersonal, vast, infinite,

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:10%
empty.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:16.050 align:middle line:10%
And you do that by
rising above the mind,

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:10%
literally, in the sense
that the chakras are

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.210 align:middle line:10%
one above the other.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:90%
There is another way.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is going
deep inside the heart.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.850 align:middle line:84%
There also, you'll
find something

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.404 align:middle line:84%
that's way beyond your
small individuality.

00:39:28.404 --> 00:39:31.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the transformative
processes have something

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in common, and that is often
a person that undergoes such

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:49.250 align:middle line:84%
processes is able to reach
deeper within themselves

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:84%
to a place that they
did not know before.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The question is
what is that place,

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:57.340 align:middle line:90%
and what can we call that?

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I like the word
soul, in the sense

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:06.140 align:middle line:84%
that it means our innermost
center of individuality,

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.340 align:middle line:84%
a place of connection
with the divine,

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and a place that can help us
harmonize the entire psyche

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:90%
and personality.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the locus of
the evolving consciousness

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:90%
in a human being.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So attaining soul
consciousness is

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:33.187 align:middle line:84%
a key step in the process
of spiritual unfoldment.

00:40:33.187 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Sri Aurobindo suggests
that deeper within,

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
we are a spiritual being who has
come here upon earth in order

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:84%
to participate in this
evolution of consciousness.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And this spiritual being
works through our soul.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is a portion
of the divine being

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:06.210 align:middle line:84%
that has descended into
this evolution and stands

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:84%
behind our life and
throws out its intimations

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:90%
to us, but from behind a veil.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like a kind of layer
that separates us from a deeper

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
core, which is
certainly more divine.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:35.040 align:middle line:90%


00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a layer of this dark
energy, that kind of separates

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.174 align:middle line:90%
us from who we really are.

00:41:45.174 --> 00:41:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
that we can work through,

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:90%
that we can transform.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:84%
If you go deep
enough, you really

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.700 align:middle line:84%
find that there is genuine
sense for beauty, discovery

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of the divine within,
that we have that higher

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:84%
ideal even if we
don't necessarily

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:90%
completely impersonate it.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think most of
us have some sense,

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
some experience of
the soul behind.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have had some
kind of promptings of that,

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:84%
have had some glimpses
that there was some greater

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:84%
realities, that something
seems to be guiding

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:29.600 align:middle line:84%
the things that are occurring
in our life in some way.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What is that little voice
in you that knows what's right

to collect a higher

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to collect more wisdom.

Historically, one
of the ways that I

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.790 align:middle line:84%
have connected to
my intuitive wisdom

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.490 align:middle line:84%
is through the
use of a pendulum.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:42.380 align:middle line:84%

I access that kind

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.800 align:middle line:90%
of daily intuitive wisdom.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the hospital
and I was paralyzed,

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I had to find another
way of doing it.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, I
imagined doing the pendulum,

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.120 align:middle line:90%
using the pendulum.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.577 align:middle line:90%

00:54:03.846 --> 00:54:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the
intuitive process,

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't find it as easy to
connect to myself deeply

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.358 align:middle line:90%

But there's a bit
of a paradox there,

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:21.540 align:middle line:84%
because on the other hand,
I think that I am actually

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:30.540 align:middle line:84%
in that space more, because a
lot of my cognition and memory

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:35.077 align:middle line:84%

have been eroded.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a lifelong practice to
find your inner guru again,
