forgiveness for him,

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.330 align:middle line:84%
what I realized when I
finally found him and was

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.590 align:middle line:84%
able to talk to him is that
I said, here's the truth.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The truth was is I
loved you so much

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and my heart was so
broken when you left.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's
heart was so broken,

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and it was broken because
we loved you so much.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I turned that
love into anger.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I realized now that you
weren't trying to hurt us.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Your life was just happening
the way it happened.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.950 align:middle line:84%
There was not intent
to do me harm.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I want you to know
that though I don't condone

those actions, I don't
like the actions you took,

forgiveness for you.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.980 align:middle line:84%

forgive me for having

I would say that's the core.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.670 align:middle line:84%

we did or didn't do,

that our thoughts
and our consciousness

are part of a chemical reaction

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of suggesting
that, for example, when

you're listen to the
radio, the show comes

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.330 align:middle line:90%
from inside the radio.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But just like the
radio, the brain

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is actually
receiving information

01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and then translating it into
our physical expression.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%

important, but it is not

>>What if it were
possible that we

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.860 align:middle line:84%
could upgrade our
mental software,

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.760 align:middle line:90%
our emotional software?

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We could upgrade
it to a place where

01:29:06.490 --> 01:29:08.410 align:middle line:90%
love was the operating system.

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:11.720 align:middle line:90%


01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.400 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that feeling
of love, everything changes.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Your worldview changes.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Your beliefs change.

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You can just fall in
love with someone,

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you have happiness

01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
at just waking up in the
morning and brushing your teeth,

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.390 align:middle line:90%
because you're in love.

01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
What if that was possible for
us as a whole human species

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to actually integrate
and download

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that software into our
hearts and our minds

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and live life with that belief,
that everything in creation

01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.340 align:middle line:84%
was loving, that everybody
was kind, that everybody was

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:50.380 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, and we all
got to play in a world

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
where we treated each other with
honor and respect and kindness?

01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:57.870 align:middle line:90%


01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And it starts today.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.190 align:middle line:84%
It starts right now
for you and for me.

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:07.725 align:middle line:84%
And I honor you for being
willing to make a new choice.

>>NARRATOR: One night,
I had a wonderful dream.

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything was aligned,
one-- I, all human beings,

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
the animals, nature, God.

01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It was like a huge, magic
globe, a beautiful spaceship

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:47.615 align:middle line:84%
Earth in which only a
single energy pulsated,

01:30:47.615 --> 01:30:49.010 align:middle line:90%
connected to everything.

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.800 align:middle line:90%


01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And then in this dream,
Moritz asked me again,

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Mommy, when I'm grown
up, will we still

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.470 align:middle line:84%
be here, the animals,
the whole Earth?

01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:05.374 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
destroying everything.

01:31:05.374 --> 01:31:09.670 align:middle line:90%


01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:13.320 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
knew the answer.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's in our hands.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.060 align:middle line:90%
We are the creators.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.520 align:middle line:84%
We decide what we manifest
and what we don't.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we continue
our distraction,

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
it's only our own
responsibility, no excuse.

01:31:29.190 --> 01:31:32.436 align:middle line:84%
Our condition and
the world's are one.

01:31:32.436 --> 01:31:37.848 align:middle line:90%
Then let's change.

01:31:37.848 --> 01:31:45.240 align:middle line:90%


01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:50.305 align:middle line:84%
And we can make a
change right now.

01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:53.167 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel like
it, share with me

01:31:53.167 --> 01:31:58.770 align:middle line:84%
the following moment for a
collective manifestation,

01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:01.836 align:middle line:84%
making a dream come
true, a better world

01:32:01.836 --> 01:32:07.248 align:middle line:90%
created by all of us now.

01:32:07.248 --> 01:32:12.168 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to gently touch
the area of your heart.

01:32:12.168 --> 01:32:19.548 align:middle line:90%


01:32:19.548 --> 01:32:23.484 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in joy.

01:32:23.484 --> 01:32:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And exhale your gratitude
for being one with God

01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:32.202 align:middle line:84%
and a godlike creator
of everything.

01:32:32.202 --> 01:32:36.060 align:middle line:90%


01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you hold
your Earth in the space

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:45.746 align:middle line:84%
of your heart, this beautiful,
magic planet that gives us

01:32:45.746 --> 01:32:46.246 align:middle line:90%
light.

01:32:46.246 --> 01:32:50.600 align:middle line:90%


01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in joy.

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:55.270 align:middle line:90%


01:32:55.270 --> 01:33:01.406 align:middle line:84%
Now, you send the loving
gratitude from your heart

01:33:01.406 --> 01:33:02.398 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

01:33:02.398 --> 01:33:06.870 align:middle line:90%


01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:11.182 align:middle line:84%
And wait till the Earth
sends you back love.

01:33:11.182 --> 01:33:15.870 align:middle line:90%


01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And she will always send
you love, because she's

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.450 align:middle line:90%
nothing but love and loving.

01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:28.740 align:middle line:90%


01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Send your loving
gratitude to the universe.

01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:34.090 align:middle line:90%


01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:39.614 align:middle line:84%
And wait till you feel
showered back by love.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:46.418 align:middle line:90%


01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:50.780 align:middle line:84%
See a calm and harmonious
world blossoming

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.954 align:middle line:84%
after a collective,
planet-wide awakening.

01:33:52.954 --> 01:34:00.420 align:middle line:90%


01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Fear of suffering and
dying become senseless.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.600 align:middle line:90%


01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Material fears
become unnecessary.

01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:12.605 align:middle line:90%
Fears of loss become needless.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:16.580 align:middle line:90%


01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:21.530 align:middle line:84%
See the whole Earth,
all of us, in bliss,

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.715 align:middle line:84%
with the surprising
understanding

01:34:23.715 --> 01:34:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that our collective dream
is reality, a healed Earth,

01:34:31.890 --> 01:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
all creatures living
in peace and respect.

01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:38.960 align:middle line:90%


01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We all back in love with
us and Mother Earth.

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:51.534 align:middle line:10%
We are awake in the dream.
