>> We like to make geologic
features out of our trash,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
build mountains out of
it, or, in this case,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:84%
fill in an epic wetlands
landscape with trash.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
We landfill more
than pretty much

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:84%
any other developed
country on the planet.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> At one time, the bay was
lined with approximately 28

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.765 align:middle line:84%
landfills, and they've all
been closed except for Redwood

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:36.565 align:middle line:90%
Landfill.

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about legacy
materials that are in that--

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
all your toxic paints,
your lead, your mercury.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's been sitting
here for 60 years,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's just rotting and
leaching into this bay.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:13.069 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.402 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see we've already
got some tomatoes in there.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We want a city that's
going to be the first city

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
in the whole country,
if not in the world,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to go to 100% recycled,
100% no waste.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason
why we have someone

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
named Robert Haley as
the zero-waste manager,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%
because we're 78% there.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%
But that's not good enough.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Right, Robert?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> San Francisco has a
goal of zero waste by 2020.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
We're a good part
of the way there,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
but we're still landfilling
over 400,000 tons a year.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
This is where most of San
Francisco's trash comes.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.115 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like the
smell of garbage, huh?

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We've cut our landfilling
in half since the year 2000,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're at the lowest level
of landfill on record in San

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Francisco that I can find.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Our records go back
to the early '70s,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
but the future
would be it's empty.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.188 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.188 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
We want to try to
keep everything out

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:90%
of the landfill--

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
no incineration.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Reduce, reuse, recycle,
compost everything.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.433 align:middle line:90%
Can we get all the way to zero?

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, that remains
to be seen, but we're

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.308 align:middle line:90%
going to go as far as we can.

00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
You can just barely see the
tip of the Golden Gate way

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:90%
off in the distance.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of see the
part of the dome of city hall

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.797 align:middle line:84%
We've got the University of San
Francisco, the towers up there.

00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
commercial buildings.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.670 align:middle line:90%
There's a school.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:90%
There's offices.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
There's over 800,000 people
living in San Francisco.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
There's maybe 50,000
businesses, 350,000 households.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Every person has
to take everything

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that they touch consume,
discard and deal

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.342 align:middle line:84%
with it properly for us
to achieve zero waste.

00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:90%
It's going to take all of us.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.412 align:middle line:84%
>> So all I'm going to ask is
you don't break the fence line,

00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:42.495 align:middle line:90%
and stay inside the cones.

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We're advocates of waste
reduction and recycling.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.775 align:middle line:84%
We've been exceeding
goals since they

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:90%
started establishing goals.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:84%
100% of the concrete
will be recycled.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It'll be put into
trucks and driven

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to crushing and
recycling facilities,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
where it'll most likely
become aggregate base

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:90%
for new construction.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a rebirth.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.358 align:middle line:90%
You take it.

00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go to a grave.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It gets transformed
into something else.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And now it takes on a new
life in another building,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
another sidewalk,
another street.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.228 align:middle line:84%
And people walk on
this all day, and they

00:05:21.228 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
don't realize just you could be
standing on a building that's

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
100 years old.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> This is construction
and demolition debris.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the heavy stuff.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the building
just gets knocked down.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it gets deconstructed.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
When you deconstruct, you can
really utilize the material.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
This is just construction
demolition material

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
from this morning
at this facility.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a
person doing it.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a
machine doing it.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It kind of takes a bit of both.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So the wood's going in these
two sides, cardboard down there.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Toilet seat, everything
comes through here.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up in the
'60s, I grew up in fields.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
There were endless hills
of chaparral and places

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:90%
to play all around our house.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.735 align:middle line:84%
By the time I left San Diego,
I literally saw all of those

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
get developed with
tract housing.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It kind of got deep in me
that what we were doing

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.966 align:middle line:84%
was not really in touch
with the environment.

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
This is our beautiful city hall.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can get in there
and see what's going on.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I really had this sense I
had to do one of two things--

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
either do something
for people or do

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:90%
something for the environment.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.125 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
inextricably linked.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a job.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
What I do is who I am, and
it's really satisfying.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little cafe,
mostly drinks and some snacks.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things are packaged
a little better than others.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of containers, they
can be recycled pretty well.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:90%
The stirrers are wood.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.095 align:middle line:90%
Those can be composted.

00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
This kind of stuff is a
little harder to deal with.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It's multi-layer packaging.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Straws, not a big fan
of straws, personally.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about zero
waste back in the 1990s,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and we actually
passed resolutions

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco setting a
goal of 75% landfill reduction

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
by 2010 and zero waste by 2020.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We can recycle or compost
pretty much everything here.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:90%
That was around 2001, 2002.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So we took basically what
was a philosophy and ideal

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
and made it into an actual
city policy end goal.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> If you can't make it, go up.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.565 align:middle line:84%
We got a whole
bunch of keys here,

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and you got to know which one
goes where and what day they're

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:90%
supposed to pick up.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if you forget,
they're not too happy.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.292 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's happy when you
got to leave their garbage.

00:08:58.292 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They got a shoot here so
all the apartment buildings,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they can throw their garbage
in one area, and it goes down.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:90%
See? someone wrote on here--

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.965 align:middle line:90%
That's when they have service.

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Let it heavy on me.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go on me.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:32.284 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:33.084 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:33.084 --> 00:09:38.485 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.485 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Make my bed for the night.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:90%
There she goes.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:90%
They can dump it back in here.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.272 align:middle line:90%
Pick it up.

00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
You're like backdoor
Santa Claus here.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> When you put material
in your black trash bin,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
it goes straight
to the landfill.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
We're not sorting those
containers at this point.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you do at
the street level

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.964 align:middle line:90%
really makes a difference.

00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
We created a very convenient
simple program, three streams--

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:84%
recycling,
composting, and trash.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We've got recycling in
virtually every building in San

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Francisco.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Virtually every residential
building, apartment building,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
virtually every business,
every institution

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
has recycling in place.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We passed mandatory
recycling and composting

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.953 align:middle line:84%
which says you have to have
recycling and composting.

00:10:45.953 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
been about working

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
with the people who believe
in it, and care about it,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and can facilitate it.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a split truck.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
So on one side is the recycling.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:90%
You see it says recycling.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And one side is the trash.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:90%
It says garbage there.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And so each of these
doors open separately

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.436 align:middle line:84%
at the right place
at the facility.

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
This is coming from basically
all the bins in San Francisco

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:90%
out on the street.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
He's loading this
material into the hopper

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
so that it can go up the
conveyors onto the sorting

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's something in here
that shouldn't be in there.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:12:05.224 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of this facility
is to pull the wrong things out

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and separate the right
things into categories

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.097 align:middle line:84%
that can be sold to
places that are going

00:12:14.097 --> 00:12:15.305 align:middle line:90%
to make it into new products.

00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:84%
For every ton you see
here, by recycling it

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
we can save maybe 70 tons of all
the logging slash, the mining

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
tailings, all the
waste that comes

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:90%
from producing oil and energy.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:90%
These are resources.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
the end of the line.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's where they're trying to get
some of the last little bits--

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the broken glass, the small
lids, things like that.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
This rotating belt
magnet is pulling metal

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.242 align:middle line:90%
off this conveyor.

00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
The items going
into this bin right

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.608 align:middle line:90%
here are like small metal lids.

00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:90%
This is just from this morning.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps coming in.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
You got to get it out
of here every day.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:90%
You can't let it pile up.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of this is white office
paper, or office pack.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of our paper goes to
Asia, especially China.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where most of the
paper consumption is.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And by consumption, I mean
they're making products

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:90%
and exporting products to us.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.402 align:middle line:84%
You can also see some
beautiful bales of aluminum.

00:13:41.402 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are actually
worth some money.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:51.725 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There's green, brown,
plastic, all colors, and cans,

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.796 align:middle line:90%
all colors.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Recycling is a 24-hour thing.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a whole bunch of
people pushing shopping carts

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:90%
and digging through trash.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
It's really a collection
and money-type business

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
All day and all night,
every recyclable container

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:90%
is being processed.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> This place has been
here since the 1970s.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been in this particular
location 34 years.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It's because of efforts
of people like this

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have a Department
of Environment,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
that we have the ability
to negotiate these issues

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:90%
on a political level at all.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Recycling centers contribute
to the overall zero-waste

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
initiative, and there's no
way we'll achieve zero waste

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.325 align:middle line:90%
without recycling centers.

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
be 100% pretty soon.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It's inevitable that there'll
be outlets to recycle everything

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.430 align:middle line:90%
that we use.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> This is buyback center
glass, very high quality,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.733 align:middle line:84%
easy to recycle, easy
to process for us.

00:15:18.733 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of glass
that works really

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:90%
well for making new containers.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.089 align:middle line:90%
I see money in this pile.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Glass works for recycling.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Its cradle to cradle.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.367 align:middle line:84%
You can take the
same wine bottle,

00:15:42.367 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
make it over and
over and over again.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It gets consumed locally,
whether in San Francisco

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:90%
or Oakland.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:90%
It's recycled locally.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And they make new
bottles in Oakland.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a kind of
a closed-loop system.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard that some of the
glass in the Bay Area could

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.635 align:middle line:84%
even have glass from as
far back as the gold rush,

00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:00.435 align:middle line:90%
theoretically.

00:16:00.435 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's
certainly possible.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:90%
This is processed material.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
This is ready to go
to make new bottles.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So this is green.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
If you do it the right way,
it never becomes garbage.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> From sand, and back to sand.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Plastic bags, urban tumbleweeds.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.599 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
You use things like financial
incentives to encourage people.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
to, you pass laws

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that just say this is
what you have to do.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But short of that,
what you want to say

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is this is the culture
of San Francisco.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
In San Francisco, this
is what people do.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And then people will
tend to naturally follow

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:90%
that social more.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of
the education process.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
We're looking
exactly at this cart

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.665 align:middle line:84%
and what's there leaving
a very targeted feedback.

00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
>> From here, I supposed
to audit these bins at this

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
resident's house,
educate these guys,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
making sure they put the right
things in each of their bins.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:90%
>> This is contamination.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I need to tag this bin,
let them know that people,

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:90%
they need to fix that problem.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.126 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:35.368 align:middle line:84%
>> To keep the recycling
and composting clean,

00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
it's important that everybody
put it in the right place

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
efficient way to do it.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
The trick about paper is
if it's wet or food soiled,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:90%
you should compost it.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's clean, you
should recycle it.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We cut them slack on that--

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> This feels like
a bunch of compost.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.317 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:17:57.317 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so as you can see,
we have a lot of food scraps

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:90%
in here.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'll leave a
friendly reminder

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
saying, please
remove food scraps

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:90%
from landfill to the compost.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.645 align:middle line:90%
Copy to take back to the office.

00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Copy for my residents.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:84%
This is what I pretty
much do every morning.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> That tag will actually
generate an evening outreach

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:90%
team.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll get a copy of that tag
brought back to the office.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Folks will receive
that, and then they'll

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
come back and knock on the door
to speak to the resident face

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.717 align:middle line:90%
to face.

00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> This is good.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Door to door throughout
the entire city.

00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:44.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Marvin.

00:18:44.872 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Little bit messy.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Look, I don't throw it out.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I arrange it and again re-use.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't like everything
only buying, buying, buying.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Why not we want to save all?

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is our responsibility.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the responsibility
of human being.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to make everybody happy
and make my life good, good,

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and better.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Then when-- this is my belief--

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
when I will die, when
the Last Judgment Day,

and they recognize, oh,
this isn't that bad,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
they start to do it too.

They are 92 years old.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This restaurant, the compost
and recycle percentage is

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:90%
almost 90%.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
They have signage
all over the place,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and everybody knows what
they're supposed to--

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And blue goes this.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> --and what they're
supposed to put in each can.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It helps.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is what's
in the green bins.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
There's some things we don't
want, like the aluminum can,

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:90%
the juice box.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm seeing mostly food,
yard trimmings, soiled paper,

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:90%
compostable plastics.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
These green ones are
all compostable bags,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:84%
so we're seeing
people using a lot

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.585 align:middle line:84%
of compostable plastic
bags, compostable plastic,

00:24:28.585 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:90%
compostable plastic.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:90%
That is not a compostable bag.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Good material.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But once again, it's
trapped by a plastic bag.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:90%
This is like 99% compostable.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
it may not look that
great right now.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:84%
But by the time it's processed,
it will look like black dirt.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Compost is so ironic.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just full of mystery.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely valuable.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's loaded with life, even
though you can't see it.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:90%
This is magic.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We're a very dense city, and
we don't have places here to do

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
the actual composting.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have to export
our compostables.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, we're surrounded
by farms and vineyards

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:90%
not too far away.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So we send the material out
to composting facilities

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:84%
on the perimeter
of San Francisco.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It gets made into very
high-quality organic compost.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes back to
the farms and vineyards

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and comes back as food
and wine to the cities.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So we've created, essentially,
a closed composting loop.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Soils become hardened if you
don't feed them enough organic

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:90%
matter.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Soils become unhealthy.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we need,
literally need, compost

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
as part of our whole
cultural practice

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to keep soils in the
kind of condition

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
where we can produce
healthy food.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I became interested in health.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like at one point
I couldn't-- right or wrong--

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I
couldn't find anything

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
in a store that
was healthy to eat.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
raise my own food.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, I realized,
well, I think I'm a farmer.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I became involved
in farming for health

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and then found out that
I like compost more

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:90%
than I like farming, actually.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And so I work as a consultant.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I like the tools of farming.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I like turning the Earth.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I like what it smells like and
that it's an ongoing creation

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what I love
about farming.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happens here that is
very beautiful and interesting

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is we take a piece
of material, food,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:90%
and then we turn it into this.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the red wiggler,
if you will-- earthworm.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Without these guys, we
can't get that job done.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The earthworm's taking
in this material that

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
has protein-rich bacteria
on it, consumes those.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:90%
And what passes out is a manure.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like having cows, or pigs,
or chickens manuring your soil.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the soil is a
product of a microbe's gut.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.517 align:middle line:84%
All of this dark material
that we're looking at,

00:27:15.517 --> 00:27:17.850 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, has come
through the gut of a microbe

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.007 align:middle line:90%
at one time or another.

00:27:20.007 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is the full
cycle, if you ask me,

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:84%
on why we want this
not in the dump.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But we want it to
come back to us

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
as farmers so we
can decompose it

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
into a simple material
called humus that goes back

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:84%
out into soils that we've
lost during farming operations

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:90%
over a hundred years.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> By the cooperation
of the cities,

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and the compost companies,
and the farmers,

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
it's just driven compost
prices down wonderfully,

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and we can offer our product
for a little bit less than

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:90%
otherwise.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:90%
So there is a full circle.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> In nature, there's no waste.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.017 align:middle line:84%
All waste is food
for something else,

00:28:00.017 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way it should
be in an industrial economy

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The water heater
here, a microwave, a fan,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
old-style toaster,
Christmas light.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know there's
a global dumping crisis

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:90%
in e-waste.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in the industry, computer
industry, for 20 years.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It's really not the right
way to do it to throw away,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
because electronics
contain toxic materials,

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.810 align:middle line:84%
such as lead, cadmium,
brominated retardant plastics,

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as their
precious metals.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:84%
When it's not done
property, 80% of this

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.687 align:middle line:84%
is going somewhere
to kill somebody.

00:28:48.687 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the documentary
that changed my life.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I saw a piece of this clip in
the PBS program by Bill Moyers.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, I didn't
realize that we are

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:90%
causing so much global dumping.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> After they have
dismantled the computers,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.996 align:middle line:90%
they burn the useless parts.

00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Every day, villagers
inhale this dirty air.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm looking at this, and
this is a pretty shocking story.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I couldn't
get this out of my mind.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But although the drinking
water is no longer drinkable

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and the air smells foul, the
populace of Guiyu is still

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:84%
largely ignorant of the
health impacts of the imported

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:90%
poisons.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is almost like
you saw a person about to die

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
on the street, and you
walk a few blocks down.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.965 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to just
let it go like that,

00:29:56.965 --> 00:29:58.590 align:middle line:84%
or am I going to do
something about it?

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example
of a customer.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
building customers.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
We service every single
tenant in the building.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:90%
These are our buildings.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:90%
That's our building.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:90%
That's our building.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Basically, which one is not?

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example of our kiosks.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.898 align:middle line:84%
People are putting this
down, and then our staff

00:30:26.898 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:90%
will come and pick it up.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:90%
This is the Burlingame hub.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
This is where we ship all the
items back from our eco-center,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
we do the sorting.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We decide what items can be
salvaged for responsible reuse

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
in the US, what
item can be fixed,

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:84%
what item needs
to be dismantled,

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and what item needs
to be recycled here.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So when an item
comes in, if there's

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
an item that's reusable, it'll
be put on this conveyor belt.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> As you can see
with this one here,

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:84%
it actually doesn't
display anything.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But it power's on, so it's
still worth some money.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a CD,
CD drive, speakers.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything can be
recycled in the world.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of how
much of a cost it is.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.510 align:middle line:84%
How much do you have to
process it to recycle it?

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:84%
21% of items we are able to
fix for responsible reuse,

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.332 align:middle line:84%
whether as a whole
unit or as a part.

00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:39.360 align:middle line:90%
A cracked iPhone 4 screen.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The other 79%, we
basically take it apart.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:90%
There's RAM.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.820 align:middle line:90%
There's mixed copper.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:90%
There's CPU boards.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Over here you can
see the aluminum.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The better the sorting, the
cleaner the stream you get,

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:84%
the higher percentage of
recycling you can get.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Now they are going to
be taken to be shredded.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>> This is old shredded
electronics after some

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
of the base metals have been
recovered by another recycler.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Some kind of a sliding
block, and a gear,

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and some circuit
boards, and a battery.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> For so long, we looked
at this as a waste.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm a miner, this is an
incredibly valuable resource

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:84%
if you look at this as an ore,
as a raw material ore, which

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.800 align:middle line:90%
is exactly how we look at it.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> This is basically large
mixed rigid plastic from San

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Francisco.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:84%
For us, the really hard stuff
are the assembled products,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.768 align:middle line:84%
the composite
items, the plastics.

00:33:20.768 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind
of facility that

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.780 align:middle line:90%
can help us crack that nut.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.898 align:middle line:84%
>> I think plastics are
a really cool material.

00:33:35.898 --> 00:33:37.190 align:middle line:90%
We can make cool stuff with it.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:90%
You can do many things with it.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.310 align:middle line:90%
It makes our life safer.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
It makes our cars lighter,
our planes lighter.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And it makes the
bottles that we drink

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:84%
many beverages out of
unbreakable and cheaper

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:90%
to ship.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
advantages to plastics,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
which used to be called the
space age material, right?

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, well, we're not so
much sure we love it anymore

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
because we find
it in our oceans.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting our sea life.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
We see it scattered
throughout the environment,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're not so sure we like
it as much as we used to.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I came to the same
conclusion 20 years ago.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There's literally hundreds of
kinds of plastic when you talk

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.100 align:middle line:84%
about the resins, the
colorants, the additives,

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:90%
the different sub-properties.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.127 align:middle line:84%
You can't just mix
plastics together.

00:34:20.127 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't even initially tell
what they are very easily.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to deal not only with
segregating them by the family,

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:90%
by the type--

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.510 align:middle line:84%
so polyethylene, or
polypropylene, or ABS.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.495 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds and thousands
of grades of plastics.

00:34:35.495 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> There's high density.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:90%
There's medium density.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:39.572 align:middle line:90%
There's low density.

00:34:39.572 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:90%
There's linear low.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:90%


00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:48.510 align:middle line:84%
After we've separated the
plastics by type and grade

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
we then send that to
our extrusion line.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
What the extruders do
is they melt the plastic

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:90%
into one homogeneous material.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:84%
That material's then squeezed
out through a die plate

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.160 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of
little holes in it.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out just
like spaghetti strands.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They get dipped into a water
bath, where they solidify.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:84%
After they've been solidified,
we chop them into little pieces

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that we call pellets, the
currency of the plastics

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the shape and
type of plastic and properties

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that you would buy from a virgin
producer of plastics making

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.020 align:middle line:90%
plastics from petrochemicals.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So we sell to printer
manufacturers,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.895 align:middle line:84%
and we sell into
very demanding parts.

00:35:31.895 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You can see a
mirror finish here.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I can maybe show
you the actual molded part,

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and you can see what a
shiny surface it has.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.060 align:middle line:84%
This is almost unheard
of in recycled plastics.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
This step enables us to
literally close the loop.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> A question that a
lot of people ask is,

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.988 align:middle line:90%
how do I get rid of things?

00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's not
really the right question.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not good enough
just to sell a product

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.784 align:middle line:84%
and have no
responsibility anymore.

00:36:03.784 --> 00:36:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They have to be part
of the whole loop.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The first place
would be to design

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:84%
with durability, reusability,
and recycling in mind.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The right question is, how
do we best utilize resources?

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We're at the Goodwill
headquarters in San Francisco,

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is where it all
happens, all the sorting.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is where all the
donated stuff comes in.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:39.230 align:middle line:84%
It's sorted into these
boxes, separated out

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.320 align:middle line:90%
into various categories--

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:51.747 align:middle line:84%
housewares, linens, DVDs, CDs,
boxes full of the stuff, books.

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:55.970 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest categories
that Goodwill gets is textiles,

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and it's growing.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:08.888 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.888 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We get a lot of
old stuff in here,

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes we get a
lot of nice stuff in here.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, who's giving
away this nice stuff?

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'd like to be
in a position like that

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:90%
to give away good stuff.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The good-quality stuff is
put on the top conveyor belt,

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:90%
things that can be resold.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the things that
can't be resold--

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're torn
or they're stained--

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
go on the bottom conveyor
belt. And the top one

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:84%
goes into Goodwill's
resale system.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:84%
The sad piece of this
is that if this goes on

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.708 align:middle line:84%
to the shop floor at Goodwill
and doesn't sell after a month,

00:37:54.708 --> 00:37:56.250 align:middle line:84%
then the sheer volume
of stuff coming

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.070 align:middle line:84%
through the system
on a day-to-day basis

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:84%
requires this to be moved
out to the shop floor

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to make room for
more stuff coming in.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The stuff on the shop floor
gets taken off the racks,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and it gets put
into these big bins

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
where people come
and root through it,

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and they buy things
for $2 apiece.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> This has a little
battery in it.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And you push that battery,
and it makes a sounds.

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.203 align:middle line:90%
The kids like that, see?

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have oodles of them.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I give maybe about
15 toys away a day.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is
sort of a grab bag.

00:38:33.658 --> 00:38:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I just saw what was on the top.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that it's
worthwhile, just

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.322 align:middle line:84%
for my own personal
collection but also to resell.

00:38:41.322 --> 00:38:44.110 align:middle line:84%
This is Hendrix, but
it's pretty much trash.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The clothing and textiles at
this point when it's in a bale

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:84%
is worth $0.22 a pound, so $0.22
times 1,000 pounds per bale.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.210 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop here.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be shipped
overseas to people

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:90%
that resell items over there.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.870 align:middle line:84%
It could go to a large-scale
recycler that then breaks it

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
down and builds it
back into recycled yarn

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.570 align:middle line:84%
or into insulation for houses
and so on and so forth.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is we should
never ever throw garments out

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:84%
in the garbage destined for
landfill, because that item can

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.700 align:middle line:90%
be rebought by someone else.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It can be brought back
again, and then rebought,

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and then rebought,
and then rebought.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, at the
end of its useful life,

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:84%
when it's really
threadbare, even then

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that could become a
completely new thread

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that will be made back
into another garment.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Put simply, we really
should be thinking about,

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:84%
where does it come from,
and where is it going to?

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, we're
recycling, composting 80%.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
That means we're struggling
with the last 20%.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just a complete
product design

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:84%
flaw to make some of these
products in this way.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's thousands
and thousands of products.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.540 align:middle line:84%
It would be very hard to
make a law for each product.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So instead, we're looking at the
real problem products-- plastic

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.938 align:middle line:90%
bags, Styrofoam containers.

00:40:22.938 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And there should never be
toxic materials in the trash.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:30.626 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.626 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we
should meet Sushma

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.720 align:middle line:84%
because she heads up the
toxics reduction program area.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:42.042 align:middle line:84%
And Sushma's office is right
here, and there she is.

00:40:42.042 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Sushma Bhatia.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.045 align:middle line:84%
She is my equivalent
but for toxics.

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of what I have to
deal with are toxic products,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:84%
products that contain toxic
or hazardous chemicals that we

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.900 align:middle line:90%
cannot always recycle or reuse.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
We want to try and divert
those toxic chemicals

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:90%
from the landfill stream also.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I was doing a lot
of artificial nails.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have a very
bad rash on my body,

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.220 align:middle line:90%
but that's most on my face.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:84%
My lips are even
swollen, and I have

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to get into the emergency
room for a couple of times.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.360 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We have customized programs
that we create for businesses

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:84%
versus residents
versus city agencies.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Each of these populations use
different kinds of products.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They have different
kinds of needs.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And we offered training classes,
and Heidi was the very first

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.480 align:middle line:84%
one to take us up on the offer,
which is why she's our hero.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When we buy the nail polish,
we already see the ingredients.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.784 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't contain toxics here.

00:41:55.784 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a separate campaign
for dry cleaners around dry

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:90%
cleaning solvent.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Looks like you got
a spill on this one.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.025 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing big.

00:42:16.025 --> 00:42:16.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Over 80% to 85% of dry
cleaners use this really toxic

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.610 align:middle line:84%
solvent called
perchloroethylene.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
goals as a city was

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to try and get
these dry cleaners

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:84%
to use a safer solvent,
a solvent that's

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:84%
better for their health and
better for the environment.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We discovered that wet
cleaning, which uses essentially

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.910 align:middle line:84%
water and soap, is the most
environmentally preferable

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:41.870 align:middle line:90%
solvent.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had a couple of deaths
in the family that were cancer

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:49.010 align:middle line:84%
related, and we don't really
know if that was a cause

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of being exposed to the
dry-cleaning solvents for such

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
a long time or not or if it's
just a natural occurrence.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But why take that risk
when there's alternatives?

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Like to do my
dishes, of course.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> For residents, we are
creating a lot of safe disposal

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
options because we found
that most residents have tons

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
of chemicals in their houses,
and they don't know how to get

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:90%
rid of them.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Look for a product that
says caution and not

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:23.680 align:middle line:90%
something like danger--

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --because danger is the
highest level of toxicity

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.230 align:middle line:90%
or health impact.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yikes.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> As a household,
as a resident,

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.990 align:middle line:84%
we can generate so many
different kinds of materials

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that can be classified
as hazardous waste,

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:40.750 align:middle line:84%
things like cleaning products,
personal-care products,

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and then there's medicine.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.118 align:middle line:84%
We've heard from residents
that oftentimes they'll

00:43:47.118 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:84%
buy a medicine-- it
could be an Advil

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.835 align:middle line:90%
or something for a headache.

00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And they'll take a pill,
and the rest of the bottle

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:84%
just sits in their medicine
cabinet until it gets expired.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they don't
know what to do with it.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We learned that most
people just want

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to drop off their unwanted
medicine at the point of sale.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.856 align:middle line:84%
They simply want to go back to
the pharmacy and drop it off.

00:44:06.856 --> 00:44:09.490 align:middle line:84%
There's 24 different sites
all over San Francisco

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:90%
neighborhoods.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So any resident in
San Francisco now

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:16.290 align:middle line:84%
has the opportunity to get rid
of their medicine properly.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you very much.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> What we've done is
we've installed a safe

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
medicine-disposal bin, and
residents can easily put

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.640 align:middle line:84%
their unwanted
medicine in that bin.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Just in nine months of
running this program,

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:84%
we've collected about
six tons of medicine.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that six tons of
medicine that we would not

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.830 align:middle line:84%
have collected
would have otherwise

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.200 align:middle line:84%
ended up in the waste-water
treatment facility

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:90%
or in our landfills.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been in the business
just about five years now.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in an
environmental services company

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:90%
prior to that.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions that
kept being asked to me over

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and over again was,
well, it's really nice

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that you can handle all
my hazardous materials.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But the real question
is, is can you handle

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.580 align:middle line:90%
my bio-hazardous materials?

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I found that there was
a massive need for it.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We've selected this
particular facility

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.070 align:middle line:84%
because they're a very
large-scale veterinarian

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:13.870 align:middle line:90%
service.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:84%
They literally have all of
the waste streams represented

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.380 align:middle line:90%
for bio-hazardous waste.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The white container here
is for pathological waste.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So what you might
find in here are

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.803 align:middle line:84%
things that are from
neutering procedures,

00:45:32.803 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:84%
That should be handled
as pathology waste,

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and those will all go
into this waste stream.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.870 align:middle line:84%
This would be
chemotherapeutic waste.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.410 align:middle line:84%
That would be anything
like gowns, gloves, masks

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to being anything
else that's used

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.480 align:middle line:84%
in the administration of
the chemotherapeutic agents

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.200 align:middle line:84%
for their patients,
and in this case

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.500 align:middle line:84%
it's the animals that
they're giving this to.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And the red container is for
the bio-hazardous material,

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.050 align:middle line:84%
which would be your
sharps, anything

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that would be considered
to be potentially

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.910 align:middle line:90%
infectious material.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The blue container up here
is for pharmaceutical waste.

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I as a driver will come
in and lock this shut.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Once it's locked shut,
this entire container--

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.800 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, with all
that plastic in it--

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.320 align:middle line:90%
will end up in an incinerator.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a chemical first
and a therapeutic agent second,

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.550 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing about it
that's actually recyclable.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you
can do is destroy it.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like we're
pushing our problem somewhere

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.950 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:57.580 align:middle line:84%
We're pushing our
problems into the future.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:02.890 align:middle line:84%
We're pushing our problems
onto other societies.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:06.230 align:middle line:84%
We're pushing our
problems onto nature.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:10.880 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is just being
lazy and being sloppy.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.340 align:middle line:84%
People would say I'm
an idealist because I'm

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.250 align:middle line:84%
looking for a better
future, a more ideal world.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.280 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also very
realistic about what

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:84%
we can do now to take steps,
even big steps, towards that.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
A very simple example is we
need better energy conservation

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.930 align:middle line:90%
and renewable energy.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We are at a project site
we call UC Davis Biogas Energy

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Project, where we test the new
technologies for converting

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.930 align:middle line:84%
waste into bioenergy
and fertilizer products.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.480 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been working with
Ruihong Zhang at UC Davis

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.770 align:middle line:84%
for some time now, and she's
developed some really good

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:90%
anaerobic digestion technology.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's at the point now where
it's being commercialized.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> 70% to 80% of this
will go into the biogas.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We want to power our
composting trucks with chili

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:12.070 align:middle line:90%

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.200 align:middle line:84%
San Francisco does
not exist in a vacuum.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.710 align:middle line:90%
We import almost everything.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.567 align:middle line:90%
We export a lot of things.

00:48:25.567 --> 00:48:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So we really have to work
with a lot of different people

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:33.060 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of different places in
a lot of different dimensions.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> This project is actually a
joint project between General

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Mills from
Minneapolis, Minnesota,

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Olam company from
Singapore and from here

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:45.000 align:middle line:90%
in Williams, California.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.950 align:middle line:84%
This project reflects the
need for large volumes

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.590 align:middle line:84%
of organic matter to
compost to put out

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:54.200 align:middle line:90%
on thousands of acres of land.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:84%
This is tomato pulp from
canning varieties of tomatoes.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.250 align:middle line:84%
These have been harvested
as whole tomatoes.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we have this beautifully
moist but not overly wet

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:14.960 align:middle line:84%
seed and skin that I can mix
at about one-third of volume

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to rice hulls and almond
processing waste that

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.720 align:middle line:84%
will give us a great material
that will help the next crop.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It is actually steaming.

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Compost is this simple,
beautiful process that is

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.770 align:middle line:90%
a reflection of us learning.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We're building
compost that increases

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:36.530 align:middle line:90%
the health of our soil.

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.403 align:middle line:90%


00:49:39.403 --> 00:49:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is very exciting
to us because this is going

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:42.695 align:middle line:90%
to be a closed-loop system.

00:49:42.695 --> 00:50:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We're competing for water.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.880 align:middle line:84%
We're competing for all
the material resources.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.490 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
change the way we do it.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Every single piece
of things we put out,

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.270 align:middle line:90%
we have to recycle them.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:29.308 align:middle line:84%
And going to this concept
of cradle to cradle.

00:50:29.308 --> 00:50:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It has to get back to
the cradle to cradle.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Recycling is
just the beginning.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.030 align:middle line:90%
It's really about people.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's about trying to do
more than just survive

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.618 align:middle line:84%
and actually be
productive, to actually put

00:50:50.618 --> 00:50:52.410 align:middle line:84%
more back into the
world than we're taking.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that's what
zero waste is all about.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.540 align:middle line:84%
my parents, driving them nuts,
picking up trash off the side

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:90%
of the road.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I used to collect
even bottle caps.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Don't make the nail
polish contains toxics.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Not only nail polish--

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.360 align:middle line:90%
now we even ask for cosmetics.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.800 align:middle line:90%

>> So I guess my choices
are to keep it simple.

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, regular soap.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.518 align:middle line:90%


00:54:27.518 --> 00:54:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We believe in zero waste, so
you wouldn't want a big trash

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.120 align:middle line:90%
can.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.380 align:middle line:84%
We actually really do
use this little thing

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:90%
as our trash can here.

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:37.710 align:middle line:90%

>> If you need to do any
composting or recycling,

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.060 align:middle line:90%
call me up.
