00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>So, Drunvalo, tell me a little
bit about your background.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.492 align:middle line:84%
I know you started
in astrophysics

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and then you switched
to fine arts.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little
bit about that journey

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:90%
from physics to fine arts.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, I started in the
University of California

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:10%
at Berkeley, California.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:10%
And I did start in
physics and mathematics.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I got all the
way to the last quarter

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that that wasn't
what I wanted to do in my life.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I switched to fine
arts and painting, which

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:90%
seems like a crazy thing to do.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I switched from my left
brain to my right brain.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
important thing

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to do when you consider
the work that we're

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
talking about here,
because this is

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
an integration between the
left and the right brain,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.309 align:middle line:84%
between physics and art
and science and religion.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>And in the ancient
days, those two things

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
were very connected,
weren't they?

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Almost all of the
ancient philosophies

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
considered art and science
and mathematics and religion

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.711 align:middle line:90%
were all interrelated.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%

your spiritual background.

What has been some of
your spiritual training,

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:90%
or experiences that you've had?

background is very varied.

[CHUCKLES]

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I began in life as a Catholic.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Catholic
schools, and I did

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:90%
the traditional Catholic scene.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
However, at one
point in my life when

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I was still young, in my 20s, I
completely flipped out of that

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and became Jewish, to
the dismay of my parents.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point, I
became attracted to Sufism

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and studied with Hazrat
Inayat Khan and Murshid Hasan

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and many other Sufi teachers.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I spent about 11
years in Sufism.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And in studying
Sufism, I realized

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that all the world's religions
were interrelated in a way

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't ever really
suspect when you're just

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
in one or the other.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And then something
happened to me one day.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Actually, from Sufism, I
began to study Hinduism.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was studying meditation
with a Hindu teacher,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:90%
exactly as he told me to do it.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And something happened that
wasn't in the book sort of.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
My wife at that time
and myself decided

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
we were going to
study meditation.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And we were very
serious, and we sat down

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
in front of a
little altar and we

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
began to say the
mantras and et cetera

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that we were told to do,
and to try to understand

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:90%
what meditation was about.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And one day, just seemingly
popped into our experience

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
these two very tall angels
appeared in the room.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:90%
They were about 10 feet tall.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
One of them emitted kind
of a Kelly green color,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and the other one sort
of an ultraviolet light.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And they were identical.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing they said was

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that they were not separate
from us, but that they were us.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
We didn't understand
at all what that meant.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:84%
That didn't mean a
thing to us at the time.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, as they-- and they
began to keep appearing two,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.375 align:middle line:84%
three times a day
for many years.

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Would they talk to you
and give you guidance?

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>They gave us both
information and guidance.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote this all
down in little journal

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
every time so we can remember
exactly what it all was.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And they began to lead
me to different teachers.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting,
because they would just give me

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
a phone number, and
they'd say, this

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.942 align:middle line:90%
is somebody, whoever it was.

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when you
get this in meditation,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
you go, well, I wonder if this
is really true, Especially

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:90%
the first time I ever did it.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>I bet.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>And I dialed the phone.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
it was this person.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were completely
open to me coming,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and I would go there and
study whatever it was.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They lead me to about
70 teachers this way,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
of every kind of religious
and spiritual background

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up going from
Sufism into Hinduism

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to Tibetan Buddhism to Taoism
to everything there is, almost.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But really, the main thread
through all of this--

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
something that I never
understood when I was a child--

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
when I was little, I guess
maybe 15 or so years old,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
this American Indian
came to visit us.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
His name was Good Deer, and Juan
Concha was his American name.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And him and a few
other Indians came

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to visit my sister
and my family.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.327 align:middle line:84%
And then they came every year
for 35 years, or 30 years.

00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>What did you think about that,
them always coming like that?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>I didn't know what it meant.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand it.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I just thought they were
these friends of my sisters.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But later in life, I
knew beyond any doubt

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
at all that it was the Indians
that actually initiated

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
within me the scene
of these angels,

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and not the Hindu mantras
and things that I was saying.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you a
real quick little story.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
About six months
afterwards, the angels

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
told me that I had to go
see my sister in California.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was to go by myself, and I
was to spend exactly three days

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:90%
and then return.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.181 align:middle line:84%
And so I went there,
and the Indians

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:84%
happened to be there
at that moment.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.696 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't mean a thing
to me at that moment.

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
They were there
on the first day,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and then they left
right after that.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.094 align:middle line:84%
And so other than
that, nothing happened.

00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of waiting
for something to happen,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happened.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And so exactly on the
third day, exactly the time

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.505 align:middle line:84%
when I knew that that
point in time was up,

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I packed my things in my car.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.410 align:middle line:90%
I started my motor.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to drive away.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I just got out to give
my sister one more hug.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And just as I started to
leave, she says, oh, I forgot,

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to give you
something the next time

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.461 align:middle line:90%
I see you.

00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And so she went into the
other room and she came back,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and she had her hands
cupped like this.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the
American Indians--

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
this is the Taos Indians
I'm talking about--

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
did a ceremony for you in
Akiva that they've never

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
done for a white man before,
and that it was for you

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:90%
to help you find your way.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they opened
up the hands, her hand,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and in there was a little tiny
fetish carved out of stone

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:90%
that the Indians had carved.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
a little deer.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But the deer was made of
a stone that on one side

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
was the exact color
of one of the angels,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and on the other side was the
exact color of the green angel.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So it was purple on one
side and green on the other.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that, it just
[POOF],, instantly I understood.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you how.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I just knew.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the first times
when very powerful events began

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:90%
to happen in my life.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was going back to
Vancouver, British Columbia,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:90%
where I was living at the time--

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and I was up around
Washington somewhere--

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
a little doubt
came into my mind.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, is that really true?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that I understand
that the Indians are really

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
the connection behind
what this is about?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.862 align:middle line:84%
And I asked goddesses,
would you give me a sign?

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever even
asked for a sign before,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:90%
but I did.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, will you give me a sign?

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say no more
than a minute later,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw something beside the
road that caught my eye

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:90%
so much that I had to stop.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I backed my car up
along the freeway,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
pulled aside, got out, and
walked over to the fence

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and looked.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And sitting maybe about 25 yards
away out in this flat field

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
was maybe 150 or 200
crows, black crows,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
in an absolute perfect circle
all facing to the center

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and looking at each other.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.624 align:middle line:84%
>>It looked like somebody
had drawn a circle,

00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:07.814 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
standing like this.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked at them,
and they didn't fly away.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there
and I must have

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
looked at him for about three
or four or five minutes.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they flew
away in a bunch.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.083 align:middle line:84%
And I walked back to the car and
I said, that was a good sign.

00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:20.225 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.342 align:middle line:90%
That was a good one.

00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:23.425 align:middle line:84%
>>You had more training
with the American Indians,

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and more formally
after than that?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>As the years went
by, I began to spend--

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I had probably more training
with the American Indians

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:90%
than anyone else.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I remembered
my life with them.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:90%
I was an American Indian.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I was a Taos Indian
in my last life,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and I know every
minute of that life.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And they have recognized and
told me that this was true.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you always have those
memories of that lifetime,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:90%
or did they come to you?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I didn't always
have those memories.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know any of
that until certain times.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a very complex subject.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
What some people
call a walk-in--

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I actually walked into this
body on April 10 of 1972.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And only for about 30 minutes
did I remember who I was

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and where I came from and
what that was all about.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you forget,
because the movie of life

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
here is so real that
you just forget.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
You know when you're
in a movie, sometimes

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
you forget you're in a
chair you're watching?

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, this one's really real.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And you just forget it.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until about
three years later, when one day

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I was who I was
and everything was going on.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Although I had very interesting
experiences going in my life,

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
I was actually

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.985 align:middle line:84%
from a different
consciousness level

00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and that one day the angels
came in and said, well,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
we think you are
ready to remember.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
to remember what?

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
And they said, lay down.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And I laid down, and my mind
opened is all I could say.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And for two weeks, I
barely moved off the bed

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was remembering everything
in, like, fast forward.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I could remember now every
minute from the time I left

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
a different place--
not a different planet,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
but a different way
of being than here,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:90%
a different consciousness--

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:90%
to the moment that I sit here.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.866 align:middle line:84%
I can remember the entire
process of coming into here.

00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:31.157 align:middle line:90%
>>So how do you like life here?

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>I like it a lot, actually.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:90%
It's real hard.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things you talked
about in the seminar was you

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
spent a lot of time
actually talking

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
about history, what
happened to the planet

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.421 align:middle line:90%
Earth, our earth's history.

00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And that history
is something that's

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
very different from what
we've been taught in school.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>The history that we are
given in our history books

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:90%
is just a shadow of the truth.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like if 10
people sit and watch

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
something happen,
some kind of event

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
somewhere like an
accident scene,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
each one is going to have
a different idea about what

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, the people
that wrote the history books

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.704 align:middle line:84%
were generally the
people who won the wars,

00:12:30.704 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:84%
because it was always wars
that these things were centered

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:90%
around--

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%
generally, pretty much.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so whoever won the war
became the person who decided

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
what it was that happened.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, if Hitler
had won World War II,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
our history books would
read real different.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
We would see us as the bad
guys, and it would just

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
be totally different.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we get a one-pointed
of view of what happened.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
At this moment,
there is a great deal

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:84%
of evidence coming
up around the world

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that is beginning to break
down all of our beliefs,

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and how old we think we are,
when everything started.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that everything
started approximately 3800 BC

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:90%
in Sumeria.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence now
is totally destroyed.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:90%
That just cannot be true.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>You said that something
happened 13,000 years ago

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.474 align:middle line:90%
that's still affecting us.

00:13:25.474 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, 13,000 years ago,
there was a continent

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that we've all talked about
but nobody really believes it.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Plato described it.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really believes it.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was called Atlantis,
and it was really there.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And something
happened on Atlantis.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it began
about 16,000 years ago

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:10%
with a comet that struck the
Earth right near Atlantis.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And there was something
that occurred on Atlantis

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:10%
that the effects of that
we are still feeling today.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And the problems that we
have and everything else

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:84%
were a direct result of
what happened at that time.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was a particular
section of Atlantis

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that were very different than
the rest of the people there.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And they initiated
an experiment based

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
upon what is called the
Merkabah, which we'll probably

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:90%
talk about at some point here.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And they set up an
external Merkabah

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that went out of
control and began to rip

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:90%
the dimensional levels apart.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And that Merkabah
is still rotating

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic, which many
people consider or call

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:90%
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:10%
It's based on
tetrahedral fields,

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:10%
and it's a triangular field
that comes out of there.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
in that experiment

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:84%
almost caused the
Earth to die, meaning

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:84%
not to be able to be
used as a star seed,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
as a base to grow
cultures that go

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
on to other levels
of consciousness.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
ascended masters--

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and the ascended masters
have been around here

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
for a long time; even before
Atlantis they have been here--

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:84%
did everything they could to
try to heal the situation,

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and at one point realized
that it was almost unhealable.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And the situation
in Atlantis began

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.869 align:middle line:84%
to deteriorate beyond
our belief right now.

00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And we think it's getting
bad here with our environment

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
now and all this kind of stuff.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
It was much worse then.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot worse.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Are we still
affected by this field

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that was set in motion
16,000 or 13,000 years ago?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>We sure are.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there have
been many experiments

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
by both our governments,
the secret governments,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
the outer governments, and
certainly ET races that

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.862 align:middle line:84%
have set up experiments, some
that we don't know of and some

00:15:58.862 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that we do know of,
like the Philadelphia

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Experiment and the
Montauk Experiment,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and other ones
that have been used

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to try to correct that
experiment that happened there.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Because that experiment is
not only affecting Earth,

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's affecting huge areas of
space at distances away from us

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:90%
that we can't really understand.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:30.755 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.755 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, I want to
talk a little bit

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
about the "Flower
of Life," which

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
is the name of the seminar.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And you've talked about how
this particular geometry has

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
appeared in Egypt,
in Turkey, in Greece,

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in Ireland and England--
all these different places.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the meanings that

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:90%
are contained in that geometry?

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.092 align:middle line:10%
>>The Flower of Life is
an image, like you said,

00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:10%
that has been found
all over the planet.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an image that,
without training,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
without inner training,
would look just

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
like 19 circles on a wall and
wouldn't seem like anything.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But with the proper
training, you

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
can begin to infer what
its true meaning is,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:90%
which is more than--

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
it would be very
hard to believe,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
if you were just listening
outwardly to something

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
like this, what
I'm about to say.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But actually, contained in
that image is the very creation

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.920 align:middle line:84%
image, a single
image of a field,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
through which everything
in existence was created.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Without exception--
all life forms,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:84%
the very shape of
your body right down

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%
to the color of your eyes.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
All biological life forms,
all crystal structures,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:90%
all mathematical formula--

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
everything in existence,
on all levels of existence,

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
were created by a
very simple pattern.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And that is the image.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>It's almost like the DNA of
life, you might say, sort of?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it actually created
the DNA pattern also.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It's more primary than even
those types of concepts.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
In the workshop, we
will go into detail

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:84%
to show that to the
mind, because that's

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:90%
an important thing.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Going back to Atlantis just
for a moment, when things began

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to fall apart on a dimensional
level, at one point,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
a very specific
point in our history,

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
we fell from a very high
level of consciousness.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We dropped through these
dimensional levels,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
which are consciousness levels--
down, down, down, down, down,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
from a place that right now
we don't even have the ability

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to imagine where we were at, we
were so high, all the way down

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to this place now called
Earth where we are now,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
which is the absolute--
almost the absolute bottom

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.962 align:middle line:84%
of the barrel of consciousness,
of self-aware consciousness.

00:19:00.962 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
We think we're the
greatest thing around,

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.378 align:middle line:84%
and we're really the
lowest thing around.

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>You mentioned
before this Merkabah,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
which is many things
but also a breathing

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
process, a style of
breathing that you

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
call chronic
breathing that you say

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:90%
we used to do 13,000 years ago.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And in this fall, we lost this
ability to breathe this way.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little bit
about what this breathing

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
method is and why it's so
important for us to learn it?

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, before we fell, we
used to breathe in a way that

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:90%
is real different than now.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
In this space that I'm
holding right here,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
there is the air and your
oxygen and your nitrogen

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and all the trace
elements and everything.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
There is something else in there
that the Hindus call prana.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the life
force energy itself.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And these two things
are mixed together.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.617 align:middle line:84%
However, prana, unlike air,
cannot go through walls

00:19:52.617 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:90%
or into solid lead or something.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Prana passes through everything.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
There is nowhere,
even in a void,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
the prana is everywhere
and everything.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
We used to take the air in
through our mouth and our nose,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:90%
which is into our lungs.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But we took the prana in
through the top of our head

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and from below our feet
up through the perineum,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
through a tube that still
today exists through our body.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>We still have that now?

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>It's still there.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's not being used except
in a few highly trained people

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
like certain Tibetan Lamas
and certain people that

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:90%
understand about this.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But the average person
walking down the street,

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
this isn't even
functioning-- though it

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:90%
could be at any moment.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:10%
When we breathe that
way, the prana as it

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:10%
came down through the
top of the head, passed

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:10%
through a particular
gland in our body,

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.352 align:middle line:10%
which is called
the pineal gland.

00:20:43.352 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, the pineal
gland, which sits

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:10%
right in the center of that tube
as it passes through the body,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.376 align:middle line:10%
is an eye.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:10%
We usually think
of it as a gland.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:10%
But people who've studied
this have looked at it

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:10%
and said, gee, this
looks just like an eye.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
It's round.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:90%
It's hollow.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It has a lens on it
that focuses light.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It has color receptors inside
of it, just like this one.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's looking up.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It's getting the light
that comes from above.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed,
its purpose, is

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to receive the prana from
above and to send that

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:90%
throughout the whole body.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
When we breathe in
that way, then we

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
interpret the one reality
in a different way.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Or in other words, we see
something totally different.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And we see ourselves in
a totally different light

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:90%
than we do now.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's how we
were breathing before.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we fell, we
stopped doing that

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and we started taking the
prana in through here.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The result of that
is what is called

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
good and evil consciousness.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
We are a polarity consciousness.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
We see everything as black
and white, good and evil,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:90%
female-male.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:84%
We see ourselves as inside
of a body, and everything

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
out there as somehow
being totally unrelated,

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:90%
which is not truth.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:90%
That's an illusion.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that everything
is related to everything else.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But we don't see that,
because of the way we breathe.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, many other
things began to happen.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
We started eating food,
which we never did before,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and our body became
denser and we

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:84%
went into a denser
level of existence.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>You teach this Merkabah
breathing in the workshop?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>In the workshop,
after about four days

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of training-- which
it takes a long time

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
understand, there's

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:84%
an energy field around
the body that is actually

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:90%
55 feet in diameter.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
remember that field--

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:84%
it's a crystalline
energy field--

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
before we can begin
the breathing.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But once we get the breathing
going and reestablish

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that flow in you,
then very slowly--

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps very
quickly, depending

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:90%
on you and your past training--

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you will very quickly begin
to perceive the reality

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in a different way,
which will ultimately

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
lead you into an
entirely different level

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>And this is something
that anybody can learn?

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be a--?

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>It's easier for some, because
a lot of people have had

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of
spiritual training--

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and not just in this life,
but in many lives before--

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
though everybody is fully
capable of doing this.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Even people that
you would never--

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:10%
people who are insane sort
of, and things like this

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:10%
still have that capability,
because God or the spirit

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:10%
of God is within everyone.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:10%
>>And what's it like?

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:10%
>>Once you reestablish
the breathing

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:10%
and you also reestablish
something else,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:10%
which we call the connection
with the higher self, when

00:23:53.610 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:10%
these two things are connected
again into your essence,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:10%
your life changes
rather dramatically

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:10%
and you begin to
see something that

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.062 align:middle line:10%
is very, very hard to explain.

00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
From my point of view,
there's absolutely

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
no difference
between you and me,

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
or between me and anyone else
or the walls or anything else.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything's alive.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Everything is conscious.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one spirit
moving through everything.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The other way around,
the connection

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
back from the reality to you,
also takes on a new meaning,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
like the crows sitting
in the circle out there.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:90%
This is actually you.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
This would be you,
communicating with you.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing is alive.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>I talked to a number of people
who had taken the seminar,

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and they said that just
immediately, their whole lives

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:90%
began to change.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.485 align:middle line:84%
Things that were
old patterns, that

00:24:55.485 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
had been there for a
long time, just suddenly

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:90%
start shifting, shifting.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It was almost kind of like
a personality earthquake.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>We exist in many, many,
many levels of consciousness.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.319 align:middle line:84%
We kind of think that
we are this body,

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.235 align:middle line:90%
and that's kind of it.

00:25:08.235 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't the truth.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.976 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that we exist on
many levels of consciousness.

00:25:12.976 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:10%
>>The other thing
that you talked about

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:10%
in teaching people
the Merkabah breathing

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:10%
is that it's actually
a vehicle of ascension

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:10%
to take people from the third
to the fourth dimension.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a
little bit about that?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I guess you'd have to
explain a little bit about what

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:84%
it means to go from what
third and fourth dimension is.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Third and fourth dimension
is an understanding

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of the realities that is
Melchizedek in nature,

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
or is many, many, many other
higher levels of consciousness

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:90%
see it that way.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
The American Indians see
this going from the fourth

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth world.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
There's actually no difference
between those thoughts.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
All realities begin
from the great void.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The American Indians see
the great void as a world,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and we count it as zero.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But these different
dimensional levels

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.810 align:middle line:84%
are simply different
wavelengths of realities.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Wavelength is the
key to everything.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.305 align:middle line:84%
Any physicist will know
what I'm talking about.

00:26:12.305 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It is the ultimate
key to anything

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that you can discuss
or talk about,

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:84%
because everything in
this reality is waveform.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.885 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these
worlds that we exist in,

00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
like this one, when you
look into the heavens

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and you see your stars
or you go into any point

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
into the atomic atoms or into
something like this room,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
there is a wavelength that
is associated with this.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.309 align:middle line:84%
So you could go into why
it's this wavelength--

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:90%
and I could explain that.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I will in a workshop,
but it's complex.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But this world that we
call the third dimension

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:84%
has a wavelength a
7.23 centimeters long.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.740 align:middle line:10%
It happens to be the
distance between your eyes,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.692 align:middle line:10%
or the distance
across your hand,

00:26:54.692 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:10%
or the distance from
the tip of your nose

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.399 align:middle line:10%
to the tip of your chin.

00:26:57.399 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:10%
It's in our bodies all over,
in many, many, many places.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you go up in between each
of these dimensional levels,

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:84%
there is voidness and
then a new reality.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And there is an infinite
number of them, or at least

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:90%
almost infinite.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:90%
It's right in this room.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:90%
They're all here.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.558 align:middle line:84%
They're all superimposed
over each other.

00:27:16.558 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>So you can access any
one of them, potentially?

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>If you know how to do it, it's
very easy once you know how.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
You can change your
consciousness wavelength.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
You will literally
disappear right out

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:84%
of the room, body and all,
and reappear into a new world.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these
different dimensional worlds

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:90%
are separated by 90 degrees.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
This is hard to explain now.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who are
aware of UFO phenomena,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
you seeing these UFO streaking
across the sky and making

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
a 90-degree turn and
then disappearing,

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:90%
the beings on there are all--

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
a UFO is not like an airline,
where everybody gets in

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and the airline takes you there.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Those people on there link
together their consciousness,

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and they make a very specific
change inside of themselves,

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.966 align:middle line:90%
which happens to be 90 degrees.

00:28:07.966 --> 00:28:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they do this
through their breathing

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and their connection,
they make the entire ship

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:84%
disappear and move into
the dimensional level

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:90%
that they tuned to.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a certain
tuning process

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that's done with your breath and
with your understanding and all

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Can one person
make that shift?

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>One person can make the
shift, and two or more

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
can do it in a very special way.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I never believed that we
would be doing that on Earth.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
This training here
is only on how

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:90%
one person can make the shift.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
However, we will probably
be discussing the grids

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.940 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And the information on how
two or more can do this

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is in the grids at this point.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And that phenomena, which is
a very high-level ascension

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.280 align:middle line:84%
process, will more than likely
begin to take place here

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.579 align:middle line:90%
on Earth at some point.

00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>So that's what
people are beginning

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
to do in learning
this Merkabah, is

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
beginning to learn how to
make those shifts from one

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:90%
dimension to another?

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, in the beginning stages,
it's how to connect with higher

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:84%
self, how to realize this
entire reality is just light,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and that it's connected
intimately to what

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking and
what you're feeling,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and that water can be
literally turned into wine,

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
things can take place--

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
which are what the Hindus
called the siddhis, the powers--

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.030 align:middle line:84%
levitation and a
lot of other things.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:84%
These are simple
things that have to be

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:90%
mastered and understood first.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, as time goes
on and in conjunction

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:84%
with your higher self,
which will lead you

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.637 align:middle line:84%
through the steps at
the proper rate for you,

00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:90%
then at the right moment--

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
we will teach 17 breaths,
which will lead you

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:84%
into a very specific
understanding of the Merkabah.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And the eighteenth breath
will be taught to you

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:84%
from your inner self, which will
be the one that will teach you

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:84%
how to make this 90-degree
turn, and you'll literally

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.166 align:middle line:84%
go into the other
dimensional levels.

00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:24.804 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things you
talked about in the workshop

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.240 align:middle line:84%
as something that's
going on Earth

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.110 align:middle line:84%
right now is affecting
us very directly,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:84%
specifically in terms of men
and women-- their relationships,

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and the communication
between men and women,

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and how that has kind
of gone out of sync now.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about why that is

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and how they can be fixed,
before we all kill each other?

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>To understand what's
going on with men and women,

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to go off the Earth
and look at the solar system.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
The rotation of the
planets around the sun

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and the axis that we are
tilted to the sun and the way

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that we rotate around the
sun are all major factors

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
in determining the consciousness
that is on the Earth.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And in 1950, we began to slowly
make a change on cosmic levels

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that culminated on
August 7 of 1972.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And in 1972, there
was a major explosion,

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:38.260 align:middle line:84%
you might say, on the sun that
changed the axis of the sun

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:90%
by approximately 16 degrees.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And what has now happened
is the sun is now

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.390 align:middle line:84%
rotating in a different
plane, where the planets are

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
rotating-- if the
sun was like this,

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
the planets are sitting at
about 16 degrees and rotating

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.030 align:middle line:90%
as though nothing happened.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Though they are making orbital
changes, they're very small.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the planets
are the feminine aspect

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:84%
of the solar system and
the sun is the male aspect,

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and the male and the female
aspect of the environment we

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:84%
live in is out of
phase with each other,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
in human terms what happens is,
when a male speaks to a female,

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
she literally hears
something else.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear what I'm
really communicating to you.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you
communicate back to me,

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing something
slightly different.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.170 align:middle line:84%
We did some experiments when
we had a mystery school that

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.190 align:middle line:90%
was in New Mexico for awhile.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And we took people
who were married

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:84%
or had relationships that
had an emotional bond.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And when they would get
upset over something,

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:84%
we'd sit them down and we'd
have a third person sit there

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and we'd say, OK, we'd say if
the woman was upset to the man,

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.500 align:middle line:84%
we'd say, put it in one sentence
or less why you are upset.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And she would say something
very, very simple.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.420 align:middle line:90%
She would get it down--

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm mad at you because you
take the car every Sunday,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we say to them, OK,
repeat it back word for word.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:12.651 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't do it.

00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:15.025 align:middle line:84%
He would repeat it back, but
it wouldn't be what he said.

00:33:15.025 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:90%
It'd be something else.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And we'd say, no, say
it exactly the same.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And it sometimes takes
five, six, seven, eight,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:84%
nine attempts before he
could say it word for word.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And then he would repeat
back to her his side of it,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.015 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't
repeat it to him.

00:33:33.015 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And we did this over
and over and over,

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.190 align:middle line:90%
and we began to realize--

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:40.810 align:middle line:84%
we knew of the cosmic
aspect of what was going on,

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:84%
but we could see clearly what
was happening on Earth levels.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And so the divorce rate--

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:84%
which, prior to 1950,
which was when this really

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.042 align:middle line:90%
started to come in on here--

00:33:54.042 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:84%
if somebody got married then,
they were married pretty much

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:90%
for life.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But by 1972, as these things
begin to really change

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
on big levels, we're
in a place now where

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
it's almost impossible
to remain connected.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
communication problem.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I am studying this to the best
of my ability in every way

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I can to try to find an answer.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know if there is--

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
anything you do right now is
going to be like a band aid

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:90%
until the reality changes.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And it will.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
There will come a time
very, very soon when

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:84%
the axis of the Earth is going
to change its relationship

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, and
the Earth is going

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:84%
to go into a new
orbit around the Sun.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And it will take
many years for it

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:90%
to come into stability again.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But just the shifting
of the axis--

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that alone will help much of
the communication problem.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
be awhile before we

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:84%
will be able to
easily be together

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.240 align:middle line:90%
as one, like we used to be.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's talk a little bit about
the whales and the dolphins.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
the dolphin brain,

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:84%
what the dolphin
brain is like and why

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.890 align:middle line:90%
we're so connected with them.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Most people on Earth see
the whales and the dolphins

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:84%
as just being these interesting
animals in the water,

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're not really aware
of the incredible significance

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:90%
that they have for us.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It would be real hard for me,
in a short period of time,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to truly put across everything
that I know about this to you.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you
an example, speech

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.490 align:middle line:84%
begins when a brain reaches
approximately 1,000 grams.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.060 align:middle line:10%
This is science has
figured this out,

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:10%
approximately 1,000 grams,
which is about two years old.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:10%
When a human being reaches
about two years old,

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:10%
suddenly they can communicate
because their brain

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:09.870 align:middle line:10%
size has reached this
critical mass size.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The largest other animal
besides the whales

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:90%
and the dolphins, the apes--

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.620 align:middle line:84%
when they're fully mature,
their brain is about 750 grams.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And so someday, when
they reach 1,000 grams,

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.440 align:middle line:84%
they should be able
to start communicating

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:90%
like we are right now.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins reached 1,000
grams in their evolution.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for sure, but
approximately 30 million years

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.010 align:middle line:90%
ago--

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:90%
30 million years ago--

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:84%
the dolphins were
reached and were

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:84%
able to communicate on a
level at least as a child does

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:90%
as a two-year-old.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment,
an adult human being

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:84%
has a brain approximately
1,500, 1,550 grams.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:90%
That's an adult human.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:07.790 align:middle line:84%
An adult dolphin has
about 1,800, 1,850 grams.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They have a much
bigger brain than ours.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They have areas in the
brain that we don't even

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:90%
know what it is.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know what
it does or what it's for.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And the complexity
argument, without going

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.860 align:middle line:90%
into a lot of this--

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.850 align:middle line:84%
we as humans when we
interpret the one reality,

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:84%
we use primarily light,
which is the stuff that we're

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
using through film
here now, that's

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.300 align:middle line:84%
where about 90-something
percent of our communication

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:90%
comes from, from the reality.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And sound is another
small part of it.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
These are two
little tiny slivers

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.800 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
lot more on there

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.647 align:middle line:90%
in the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:37:51.647 --> 00:37:53.230 align:middle line:10%
There's brainwaves
that are coming out

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:10%
but we're not using that,
which you can call telepathy.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:10%
There's power lines, and there's
microwaves and gamma rays

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:10%
and on and on, gamma rays--
all the entire spectrum

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:05.970 align:middle line:10%
of all this stuff.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.710 align:middle line:10%
This is all communication
from the reality.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're living on
these tiny slivers,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and blind to the rest of it.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins are
able to perceive

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:84%
100% of the entire
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So when they
perceive the reality,

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
they perceive something so
vast, so much farther beyond

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
where we're at that
you can't even--

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>So if we're looking at
something and they're looking

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
at the same thing, they're
seeing something very different

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:30.660 align:middle line:90%
from what--

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.243 align:middle line:84%
>>They're seeing
something a whole lot

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:35.055 align:middle line:84%
different than
what we're seeing,

00:38:35.055 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:84%
a greater level
of communication.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're really
important to us

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:45.245 align:middle line:84%
because we have a genetic
connection to them.

00:38:45.245 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a very
controversial subject.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
But we will discuss this
in detail in the workshop.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But we have a
relationship to them

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that is real, real,
real important.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a
relationship to their home

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:07.090 align:middle line:90%
planet, which is not on Earth.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Though they initially came
from outside of this galaxy

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago-- now,
realize the depth of time

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.010 align:middle line:90%
they've been here.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Man's been here two, three,
four, five million years.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
exactly what it is,

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:90%
but it's not been a long time.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins have been here
for 35 to 50 million years.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The whales have been here
at least 500 million years,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.100 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to
the very beginning

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
of when civilizations
began to be formed on here

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and hold all this
vast knowledge.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.500 align:middle line:84%
They are ancient,
ancient, ancient beings.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And they came here at that
time 500 million years ago--

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.830 align:middle line:84%
they were still ancient
beings even then--

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:90%
coming from another place.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And they initially
came into this galaxy

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and did not come to Earth
first, but came to a star

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
that we call Sirius, and
specifically to Sirius

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:84%
B-- and very specifically,
to the third planet

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.270 align:middle line:84%
out from the surface of Sirius
B, which is a near solid water

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.460 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:84%
They first came there,
and then discovered

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.630 align:middle line:84%
something about
Sirius A and Sirius B,

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.690 align:middle line:84%
which is that
Sirius A and our sun

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.520 align:middle line:84%
are gravitationally
linked together.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.340 align:middle line:84%
We are connected like
brother and sister.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We move through space together,
even though Sirius A appears

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:84%
to be in a tremendous
distance away from us,

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we are linked
together as closely

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.675 align:middle line:90%
as the Earth is to the Moon.

00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a fate
that is together.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And they recognized this a
long time ago, and for that

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.330 align:middle line:84%
reason came to this solar
system and came to Earth because

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.149 align:middle line:90%
of the water that was here.

00:40:57.149 --> 00:40:58.690 align:middle line:84%
They would have gone
to Mars or Venus

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.106 align:middle line:84%
if there was a lot
of water there.

00:41:00.106 --> 00:41:05.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was water on
those planets a long time ago.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Both of those planets had
oceans and were covered.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:84%
They look very much
like this place.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Are the dolphins trying
to communicate with us?

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I know we're trying
to talk to them.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Definitely.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The whales began their
communication with us

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.510 align:middle line:84%
in approximately
the early 1950s.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We were never able to capture
a killer whale, an orca

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:84%
whale, though we tried
many, many, many times.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And the orca whales, one year
after making the decision

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to try to come in closer
to us, six orca whales

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
just moved up the boats
and just sat there--

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:84%
didn't even flip a flipper,
just allowed themselves

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
to be taken into captivity,
because they wanted to begin

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:90%
the communication process.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And many dolphins have allowed
themselves to be taken in also,

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:54.700 align:middle line:84%
though there are a few
dolphins that actually did not

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.120 align:middle line:90%
want to be taken in.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And it has kind of affected
them in a real negative way.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:06.889 align:middle line:84%
But most dolphins have
volunteered to make this step.

00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's talk a little bit
about sacred geometry,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:90%
what sacred geometry is.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You've said that it's
a universal language.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And you spend some time
in a seminar looking

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
at the basic elements
of sacred geometry

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.000 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
these building blocks of life.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.830 align:middle line:10%
Can you talk a
little bit about why

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:10%
that's important to your work?

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, first of all, we
will use sacred geometry

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.220 align:middle line:10%
in the workshop a lot.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll be using it throughout.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
For almost maybe
three days, we'll

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
be talking about using
that as a language to talk

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.686 align:middle line:90%
about other things.

00:43:01.686 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be there
to teach sacred geometry,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.580 align:middle line:90%
though that's what happens.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
That's not actually my goal
or my purpose and all of that.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The real purpose
in the workshop is

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to discuss ascension
and immortality,

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious moving
from one world into another.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:10%
And in order to do
that, there simply

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:28.291 align:middle line:10%
are no human words to discuss
some of the concepts and ideas

00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:29.290 align:middle line:10%
that will be brought up.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.610 align:middle line:10%
They don't exist.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And so in order
to do that, I have

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:38.560 align:middle line:10%
to go deeply into the
person's inner-beingness

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:10%
and work with what is called
sacred geometry, the images

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:10%
that the creation
were created through,

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.610 align:middle line:10%
and use that as a
language to discuss

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:10%
certain concepts
and ideas and things

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.190 align:middle line:10%
so that a communication
can take place.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that in our cellular
memory, this information

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.620 align:middle line:90%
that you're accessing?

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>It's on cellular levels.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
It's on even deeper
levels than that.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:06.340 align:middle line:84%
It's all the way down to atomic
levels and even deeper levels

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and that the sacred
geometry is right there

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:84%
in the atomic levels
it's in everything.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing that
sacred geometry is not in,

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:90%
without exception.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you think that
the crop circles

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are an attempt to communicate
with us through some

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.700 align:middle line:90%
of that language?

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, my understanding of
the crop circles is just--

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:10%
I know very little
at this point,

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:10%
and my inner guides have told
me that my teaching on what

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.075 align:middle line:10%
that is about is yet to come.

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They said I had to
go to England first.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going there
very soon, in July.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that
will be the time

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.240 align:middle line:84%
when they communicate to me
what that is really all about.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And what I do know is that
it is a very high-level form

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry that no
ordinary human beings could

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.229 align:middle line:90%
possibly do when you know this.

00:45:01.229 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's been
people like Doug

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and whatever these two guys
names that said, I did it.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.164 align:middle line:90%
We were the ones that did this.

00:45:07.164 --> 00:45:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, while
they were telling

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.731 align:middle line:84%
that on British television that
they were the ones that did it,

00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:13.230 align:middle line:84%
there were crop
circles being formed

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:90%
at that very moment in Canada.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.434 align:middle line:84%
The levels of communication
and mathematical communication

00:45:19.434 --> 00:45:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that are coming from these
that people are beginning

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.970 align:middle line:84%
to recognize would
require someone

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of incredible mathematical
and physics background

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to even understand,
let alone create, these things.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.606 align:middle line:84%
The one message that
has been coming up,

00:45:41.606 --> 00:45:43.480 align:middle line:84%
at least through the
work of Richard Hoagland

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and a few other people that
have distinguished and seen

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:54.980 align:middle line:84%
this work, is that the
mathematical message that

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.150 align:middle line:84%
has come forth from at least
two or more of these images

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.540 align:middle line:84%
is a star tetrahedron
inscribed in a sphere, which

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is like a three-dimensional
Star of David.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the primary
electromagnetic energy fields

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:90%
that is around the human body.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.180 align:middle line:84%
It terminates one hand length
above the head, one hand length

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:15.980 align:middle line:90%
below the feet.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that tube we talked
about runs through that

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.790 align:middle line:90%
and connects through that.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And it is the primary
doorway into the other levels

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of higher
consciousness, and it is

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:90%
the basic key to the reality.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And whoever it is that
is making these things

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:84%
have described this basic
key both third-dimensionally

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and fourth-dimensional
mathematically to a tee.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And so whoever is doing this is
talking about the same things

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
discussing in the workshop.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll let you know
if I ever find out.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:52.675 align:middle line:90%
I don't know yet.

00:46:52.675 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Another thing that you
talk about in the seminar

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:84%
are the Egyptian
mystery schools,

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and what was taught
in those schools

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.969 align:middle line:84%
and how they relate
to the pyramids

00:47:10.969 --> 00:47:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and what's really being
communicated with the pyramids.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>In the workshop,
we will go into one

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptian mystery schools,
the Egyptian Mystery School

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.720 align:middle line:90%
of Akhenaten, the Law of One.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.080 align:middle line:10%
And we will give
the information that

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.210 align:middle line:10%
has only one time in
the last 6,000 years

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.190 align:middle line:10%
been presented on the earth.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.920 align:middle line:84%
This is very
important information

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:90%
about right eye of Horace.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The left eye of Horace--
which the left eye

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.920 align:middle line:84%
is controlled by the
right brain, which

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:90%
is the feminine aspect of us.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And that information was
given many, many times

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and still is being presented
in many levels of the earth.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the feminine
aspect, the psychic aspect,

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.450 align:middle line:84%
the sexual energies
and the tantras

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and the emotional body of work.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But the male aspect, the
patterns and the knowledge

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and the connecting other
side of the information that

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:84%
was necessary, was
only released once

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and has only been written
once in the world,

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.240 align:middle line:84%
though it is written
in its entirety

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
just in a single pattern
in the flower of life.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's so simple that most
people can't decipher it.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we will go into the
Egyptian mystery school,

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and how this
relates to ascension

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:90%
and their beliefs of it.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We will give the
exact patterns that

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
were used during that time, and
how they used the Great Pyramid

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.890 align:middle line:84%
as a tool for
initiation and ascension

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and also Resurrection,
and the ideas

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.430 align:middle line:90%
that they had behind all that.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We in present day
time will not be

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.040 align:middle line:84%
using the system
of understanding

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.430 align:middle line:90%
that they had then.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But by understanding
their system,

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.800 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to
understand yourself more.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why a lot of that
is brought up in the schools.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:06.294 align:middle line:84%
>>You talk about Thoth,
a friend of yours.

00:49:06.294 --> 00:49:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about what

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.330 align:middle line:84%
his influence has been in
your life, and who he is?

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:16.540 align:middle line:10%
>>I had no experience in
this kind of consciousness,

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.550 align:middle line:10%
at least not for a very,
very, very long time.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:25.700 align:middle line:10%
And so I had no memories
of the Earth's history

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.380 align:middle line:10%
and how this it
all occurred here.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very
important for me

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to first of all
get those memories

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and to understand that.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So the angels were
the ones who led me

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to this person who has lived
on Earth for a very long time.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:45.190 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the
ascended masters.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And though he's not
one of the oldest ones,

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.330 align:middle line:84%
he is a pretty old
ascended master.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:84%
He ascended during the early,
early stages of Atlantis--

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.600 align:middle line:84%
not the earliest stages,
but relatively early stages

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, and went
through ascension

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.880 align:middle line:90%
approximately 52,000 years ago.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, he has been alive in the
same body continuously nonstop

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.790 align:middle line:84%
without any break or
death for 52,000 years.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.302 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, he makes
a pretty good teacher.

00:50:16.302 --> 00:50:17.510 align:middle line:90%
He's been around a long time.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:middle line:84%
He's studied just
about everything.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.800 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that initially
said as above, so below,

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.630 align:middle line:84%
because he began to realize that
all levels are interconnected.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:32.510 align:middle line:84%
During Atlantis, his
name was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Later, when he started, actually
a person who worked with him,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Ra, started Egypt, and he
began to function through

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.600 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian schools, he
changed his name to Thoth,

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.240 align:middle line:90%
which is T-H-O-T-H.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>You said that Thoth
is one of the people

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that you got a lot of
your information from.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>There was about 70
different teachers

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.702 align:middle line:84%
that have come into my
life in various ways.

00:50:57.702 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
in physical form.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were not,
and various teachers.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Thoth has been a big
teacher in my life.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.400 align:middle line:84%
He's given me much
of the information.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the percentage is

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that's out at this workshop,
but it is a large percentage.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Also, for some
people out there, I

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.100 align:middle line:84%
said his name was
[INAUDIBLE],, and then it

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.170 align:middle line:90%
was Thoth with during Egypt.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:84%
It's also the same
person as Hermes

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:25.630 align:middle line:90%
during the time of Greece.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Literally, Thoth started Greece.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:33.070 align:middle line:10%
It says of Pythagoras,
who is given credit

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.440 align:middle line:10%
for starting in Greece--

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:10%
which is the father of modern
day science, et cetera.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:10%


00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.410 align:middle line:10%
He says right in his writings
that Thoth came to him

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:45.480 align:middle line:10%
and took him by the hand and led
him under the great pyramids,

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.620 align:middle line:10%
from whence he understood
the geometries, which

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:10%
was the geometries of the
tetrahedron, from which

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.590 align:middle line:10%
everything that he
learned came from there.

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.850 align:middle line:84%
It was in Egypt that
he learned this.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>You said that
Thoth is immortal.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.700 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to be immortal?

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, kind of the first
thought of immortality

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is that means you're going to
be able stay in a body forever.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.840 align:middle line:10%
But that's not immortality.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:10%
That's a trap, because staying
in one body is not desirable.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.580 align:middle line:84%
However, what is a definition,
or at least the definition

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.660 align:middle line:84%
from our point of view
of what immortality is,

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is not having a break
in consciousness so

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that the consciousness
remains intact.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Your memories remain
intact continuous

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.070 align:middle line:84%
as you move from one level
to another, and there

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.790 align:middle line:84%
not being any break, and
that you leave from one level

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to another at will
when you decide to.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:46.640 align:middle line:90%
This is immortality.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And so Thoth stayed in
this body for 52,000 years.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.830 align:middle line:84%
He could have left
a long time ago.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But any person that reaches a
certain level, any spirit that

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:84%
reaches a certain level of
understanding their reality,

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.470 align:middle line:84%
realizes that there is only one
god, there is only one spirit

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:middle line:84%
moving through everything,
and that there's

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.940 align:middle line:84%
a reason for the
creation of all of this,

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and that as god moves through
these kinds of people that

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.930 align:middle line:84%
have this understanding,
they realize that there

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:17.870 align:middle line:90%
is a purpose for staying back--

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that it is sometimes
useful for a certain being

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:25.030 align:middle line:84%
not to go on, but rather
to remain and to help

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that aspect which
that kind of person

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.724 align:middle line:84%
would see that
aspect of themselves.

00:53:30.724 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.390 align:middle line:84%
In Hindu terms, it's
called the Bodhisattva vow.

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what he did.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.290 align:middle line:90%
He did a Bodhisattva vow.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:39.660 align:middle line:90%
He stayed here.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.910 align:middle line:84%
However, he just left
a couple years ago.

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But even his leaving
was compassionate.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The leaving was tied into
the events of the present day

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.239 align:middle line:84%
time, which were
designed to raise

00:53:50.239 --> 00:53:51.530 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness of the Earth.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>You talked in the workshop
about these 83,000 sacred sites

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.260 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth,
and how they're all

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.070 align:middle line:90%
connected by sacred geometry.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the beginning of all
of that goes back to Atlantis

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:15.390 align:middle line:84%
again, when the experiments that
took place that began to rip

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:19.090 align:middle line:84%
the space time continuum
apart of the Earth--

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:23.650 align:middle line:84%
it was decided a
long time ago that,

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.250 align:middle line:84%
in order to find a
solution for everybody

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:90%
involved in all of this--

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.030 align:middle line:84%
life wants to find a
solution for everybody.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't want to punish
the bad guys and just

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.720 align:middle line:90%
the good guys.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Life really wants to find
a solution for everything.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
decided to do was

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.970 align:middle line:84%
to create what in
present day terms

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.680 align:middle line:84%
would be called a Christ
consciousness grid of energy,

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.010 align:middle line:84%
which is an actual
electromagnetic field

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.820 align:middle line:90%
around the Earth.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about 60 miles
above the Earth.

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It's around the planet.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.680 align:middle line:90%
It's very geometrical in nature.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a dodecahedron,
which is made up

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.000 align:middle line:90%
of 12 pentagonal shapes.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to create this field
synthetically or alchemically.

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.930 align:middle line:10%
They knew that we
were going to fall,

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.800 align:middle line:10%
and so they wanted to
create a stepping stone back

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.000 align:middle line:10%
up to the higher
dimensional levels.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And so 13,000 years ago when we
fell, a little less than that,

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:25.080 align:middle line:84%
on a fourth-dimensional level,
they created a grid of points

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.760 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They physically created them
on a fourth-dimensional level,

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and then went to a very
specific spot in Egypt

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.300 align:middle line:84%
the size of an atom,
which at that time

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:40.640 align:middle line:84%
was out about one mile away from
where the Great Pyramid sits

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.650 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And they made a hole one mile
into the Earth approximately,

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and that hole happened to
be aligned with the axis

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that the Christ conscious
consciousness grid would

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.900 align:middle line:90%
someday be created on.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:56:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They tuned to the possible
grid of the Earth,

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and they then laid out from
there both a logarithmic

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and a Fibonacci spiral and
placed the great pyramids

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.530 align:middle line:90%
exactly on that spiral.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:16.050 align:middle line:10%
Present-day scientists have
discovered this spiraling

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.560 align:middle line:10%
effect of the great pyramids
from aerial photography,

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.670 align:middle line:10%
and have re-found this hole
that I'm discussing right now.

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And from there, there are
places all over the Earth

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.260 align:middle line:90%
that are really geomancy.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.660 align:middle line:10%
They are nodal points
of energy lines

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.790 align:middle line:10%
that run through the Earth.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:42.530 align:middle line:10%
They are the very grid points
that are around human beings.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have slowly, over
13,000 years, people--

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.450 align:middle line:84%
could be in China, could be
in Tibet, could be in Peru.

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Certain tribes would get
this inner information

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.870 align:middle line:10%
that they needed to go
to this certain spot

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.020 align:middle line:10%
and build these certain
temples and everything.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.140 align:middle line:10%
And they would build them.

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:10%
But they were really just
reconstructing what was already

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.850 align:middle line:10%
there on another
dimensional level,

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:08.450 align:middle line:10%
bringing it down into the
third-dimensional level,

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:12.420 align:middle line:10%
until today we have over 83,000
sacred sites all over the world

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.720 align:middle line:10%
that are all interconnected
by logarithmic or Fibonacci

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:10%
spirals, all mathematically
delineated back to this single

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.750 align:middle line:10%
point in Egypt--

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.290 align:middle line:10%
and to another point on the
other side of the Earth,

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:10%
called Moorea, which is the
south pole of the Christ

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.100 align:middle line:10%
consciousness grid.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>And Robert Hoagland
has said that--

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Richard Hoagland.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Richard Hoagland has said that
the same relationship exists

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:38.842 align:middle line:90%
with the pyramids on Mars.

00:57:38.842 --> 00:57:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:45.930 align:middle line:10%
>>What Richard has discovered
is that the angles and the lines

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:51.850 align:middle line:10%
between the sacred
sites on Mars,

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:55.740 align:middle line:10%
just as the crop circles do,
mathematically delineate a star

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.480 align:middle line:10%
tetrahedral field
inscribed in a sphere--

00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.720 align:middle line:10%
which, again, is the key.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So even the ancient
Martians knew

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.330 align:middle line:84%
that the key to their reality
was the star tetrahedron

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.195 align:middle line:90%
inscribed in a sphere.

00:58:06.195 --> 00:58:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Though, there is much, much
more to that, and a lot

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Hoagland
has no idea about.

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And we will discuss all
of that in the workshops.

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>This grid that is
around the Earth that

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.620 align:middle line:90%
was started 13,000 years ago?

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>A little less.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>A little less.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.180 align:middle line:90%
What stage is it in now?

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.221 align:middle line:90%
What's happening with it?

00:58:25.221 --> 00:58:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>It was completed on
faith February 4, 1989.

00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:31.667 align:middle line:90%
>>What happened?

00:58:31.667 --> 00:58:32.467 align:middle line:90%
>>It was completed.

00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:33.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Who did that?

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it wasn't any
one particular person.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
It was thousands upon
thousands of people

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:44.710 align:middle line:84%
over many thousands of years
doing all kinds of things

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:48.880 align:middle line:84%
to create buildings and
chant chants and move

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.070 align:middle line:84%
crystals around,
and a lot of things.

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:55.690 align:middle line:84%
There was a great fine-tuning
that took place in the early

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.506 align:middle line:90%
'80s up to about--

00:58:57.506 --> 00:59:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:05.630 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty well culminating
in about 1990, 1991,

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:10.060 align:middle line:84%
but the primary
work was completed

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.784 align:middle line:90%
by February 4 of 1989.

00:59:12.784 --> 00:59:14.200 align:middle line:10%
If you remember,
there were people

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.450 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, especially
Europe and the United States,

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:22.502 align:middle line:10%
who just had to go to
Peru to Machu Picchu

00:59:22.502 --> 00:59:23.460 align:middle line:10%
to put a crystal there.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.060 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know why,
but they had to do this.

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Or they had to go
to Saqsaywaman.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They had to go to some
place around the world,

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to the great
pyramids, and chant.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Or usually it was
involving crystals,

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.690 align:middle line:84%
because crystals can hold
programming in thoughts,

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and that can continue on
even after the person leaves,

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:46.110 align:middle line:84%
which are means of fine-tuning,
or changing, the geomancy.

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And by making the
change in the Earth,

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:52.540 align:middle line:84%
make the change
around the Earth.

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So there was a great deal of
fine-tuning of these sites

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that were necessary to get the
grid to form a standing wave

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:00.010 align:middle line:90%
pattern up there.

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's all there now.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>What is the significance
for us in the fact that this

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.130 align:middle line:90%
has been completed?

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Without the completion of this
we would be in real trouble,

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:12.770 align:middle line:84%
because the level
of consciousness

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are on now would
ultimately destroy itself.

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.820 align:middle line:90%


01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.450 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're doing
that at the moment.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Right now, most
science gives the Earth

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.035 align:middle line:84%
no more than about 50 years
maximum before all life on it

01:00:29.035 --> 01:00:29.835 align:middle line:90%
would be dead.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But this grid was
important to get completed,

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
because different
levels of consciousness

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
must have the grid there before
the consciousness can actually

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.970 align:middle line:90%
happen.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:50.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have a grid, too.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
The everyday conscious
that we know,

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.780 align:middle line:90%
we have a grid up there also.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just slightly lower than
the one that's on there now.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of
triangles and squares,

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's a different
kind of energy field.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Our governments have been
aware of this for a long time.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
They've placed all their
military installations

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
all around the world exactly on
the nodal point of this grid,

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.069 align:middle line:84%
or on the spirals
that come off of it.

01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That's very obvious
by looking at it.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Much of the Cold War that's
been going on in the world

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
has been trying to
control this grid,

01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
because whoever controls that
grid controls the consciousness

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And Russia was the first
one to become aware

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Christ conscious
grid, the dodecahedron field,

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.002 align:middle line:84%
and that it was being
formed up there.

01:01:36.002 --> 01:01:38.405 align:middle line:84%
There are very real things
that can be detected.

01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:42.060 align:middle line:90%


01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And actually, to
be real specific,

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
every single species
of life, even

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
if there's just two little
tiny bugs of one species

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.859 align:middle line:84%
and that's all there
is in the whole world,

01:01:53.859 --> 01:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
a grid that stretches

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.650 align:middle line:90%
around the whole entire planet.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:00.740 align:middle line:10%
And so there are
these grids that

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.420 align:middle line:10%
are geometrically
spherical in nature,

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.810 align:middle line:10%
though they are made
up of straight lines--

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.390 align:middle line:10%
most of them, anyway--

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:11.370 align:middle line:10%
that extend from an
average-- this is just

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:13.020 align:middle line:10%
an average-- field
of about 60 feet

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.830 align:middle line:10%
in the Earth to an average of
about 60 miles above the Earth.

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:19.450 align:middle line:10%
And they're all
interpenetrating each other.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
If you were to see them
from off the Earth,

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
it just appears a blue
glow coming off the Earth.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
biological life fields

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, which are
reducing at the rate of, what,

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.450 align:middle line:90%
30 a minute or something?

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.386 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.386 --> 01:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
figures on this exactly.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I think there were 300
million species in world

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
at the turn of the century,
and now at the moment

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:51.190 align:middle line:90%
there is only about 150 million.

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
So maybe 3 million to--

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I think it's 300 to 150 million.

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the number is,
it has decreased by one-half

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.020 align:middle line:90%
at this moment.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness of
the Earth is going away.

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is becoming
an unconscious place

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
very, very rapidly.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But on another level
of looking at it,

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
simply transforming itself

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
to a fourth-dimensional
level of the Earth,

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
because there is another
world right here on Earth

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
right now where there's
a whole lot of life.

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:28.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's very conscious.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's aware of us, though
we are not aware of them.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>You said some of
the Indian tribes

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.855 align:middle line:84%
had gone to this
other dimension.

01:03:34.855 --> 01:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of the Indian tribes
left a long time ago--

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:38.150 align:middle line:90%
long time.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The Anasazis, for example, left
a long, long, long time ago.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.880 align:middle line:10%
The Mayans set up their
fields there a long time ago.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And certain other tribes--

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the aboriginals, et
cetera, in Australia

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:57.700 align:middle line:84%
have already their places in
the fourth-dimensional world.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
They have already been set up.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.616 align:middle line:84%
>>So they're here,
but they're not here?

01:04:00.616 --> 01:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>They're here and there
both simultaneously.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is
a species does not--

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:10.272 align:middle line:90%
you cannot destroy life.

01:04:10.272 --> 01:04:13.630 align:middle line:90%
A species simply leaves.

01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:16.310 align:middle line:90%
And so it has chosen to leave.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't want
to be here anymore

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't feel good
anymore, and so it leaves here

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and it just [SOUND EFFECT]
goes to nothing,

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:28.210 align:middle line:90%
and reappears in another world.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And on another world,
all the animals

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and all the life that we know
that are dying everywhere

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is really just being
reborn somewhere else.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
So we're not losing anything.

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformation--
a translation is

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.696 align:middle line:90%
what the [INAUDIBLE] call it.

01:04:43.696 --> 01:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%


01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's talk a little bit
about the Greys, who they are

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.212 align:middle line:84%
and what their
interest in us is,

01:04:57.212 --> 01:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
with them now.

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us who they are?

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the Greys are beings
from, well, it's complex.

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They exist on many different
dimensional levels, not just

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the third-dimensional
level, though they

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
do come from planets
outside of our system.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:26.220 align:middle line:10%
They are a very vast race
that exists in many areas,

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.200 align:middle line:10%
though most of the Greys
that are coming to Earth

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.140 align:middle line:10%
and influencing Earth are
from an area of Orion,

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:37.550 align:middle line:10%
specifically the middle star
of the Belt of Orion, which

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.270 align:middle line:10%
is a highly polarized place.

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:42.640 align:middle line:90%


01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And they are little people.

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:46.430 align:middle line:10%
They're just a little
over four feet tall,

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:50.600 align:middle line:10%
with very large heads and
big eyes and grey skin.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were part of
the Lucifer Rebellion,

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
which we will talk
about in the workshop.

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the Lucifer
Rebellion, Lucifer

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
decided to create an external
Merkabah rather than a living

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
field Merkabah that
we discuss in there.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
There's two ways that life
can work with or generate

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:15.292 align:middle line:90%
these fields.

01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
One is the one where you do
it through your breathing

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.585 align:middle line:84%
and through your aura,
through your consciousness.

01:06:19.585 --> 01:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is where
you make an external one

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:24.150 align:middle line:90%
and you get in it.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys became
so involved in this way

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of being that they first severed
their love connection with God,

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
which was necessary
in order to do this--

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
from their point
of view, anyway--

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
from all life.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.260 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to become separate.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And they ultimately ended
up with no emotional body.

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And so mentally, they
understand the whole thing.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
They understand how it all
works on all kinds of levels.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally, they
don't have any.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So they have, you might say, a
left brain and no right brain.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.450 align:middle line:90%
They're just logical.

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And they have multi-purpose
for being here.

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
They are very concerned about
the experiment that took place

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis, because
much of their problems

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that are happening are because
of what took place there,

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
even though this
appears to exist

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
in deep space
relative to us here.

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
However, because of what
happened in Atlanta also,

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
which is something sort of
complex for me to get into.

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We actually have Greys blood
in us, small amounts of it.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
life has allowed

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:46.554 align:middle line:90%
them to do experiments on here.

01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the experiment
is that they're

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
interested in is that we as
an entire dimensional level--

01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
not just the galaxy or
solar system or anything,

01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
but the entire spectrum of life
that's in the third dimension--

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is about to make a translation
into higher levels, which

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:12.424 align:middle line:84%
will go through something that
you might call the Great Wall.

01:08:12.424 --> 01:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
This is hard to explain
here, but a very

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
high dimensional level.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
capable of doing that,

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
because in order to do that,
you must have a living Merkabah

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:24.760 align:middle line:90%
field.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're going
to go through the great void

01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of all great voids.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And no thing can go through,
including their spaceships.

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And so in order
to go through, you

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
must go through a spirit
connected to God with love.

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
how to do that anymore,

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
so they've come here
to see if they can make

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
a connection with us to join a
certain aspect with their genes

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
with our genes to
create a third race.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.979 align:middle line:84%
And maybe through that third
race, a certain aspect of them

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
make it through.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this what these
abductions were about?

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:08.069 align:middle line:90%
>>The abductions, yeah.

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:12.773 align:middle line:84%
It really began-- they did
a lot of experimentation.

01:09:12.773 --> 01:09:14.189 align:middle line:84%
They've been here
for a long time.

01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:19.069 align:middle line:84%
They did big experiments
in 1912 and in 1933

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
with the Philadelphia
Experiment,

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
which was headed by
Tesla but controlled

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
by their understandings
and their technology.

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And they've done other ones--
the Montauk experiment in 1983.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And they will do other
ones in the future.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>The cattle abductions--
is that also the Greys?

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.040 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>It is true that they
actually did abduct the cattle.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
They took them
aboard their ships

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and did high-level laser
operations on them.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Linda Howe, who
worked for ABC, did

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
a movie called "The
Strange Harvest," if you

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
want to pick that one up
and see if you'll understand

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.176 align:middle line:90%
what that's all about.

01:09:58.176 --> 01:09:59.550 align:middle line:84%
When she first
started doing that

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and got all the
funding through ABC,

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
she thought it was either
the governments or some cults

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
or someone doing this, and she
investigated it like a murder.

01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper
she got into this,

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
she began to realize
that there's no way

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that anybody could do this.

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The level of operations would
require thousands and thousands

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
of highly trained physicians
to be able to do this.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
We can barely do the operations
that were done on these cows.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>What were they doing?

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>They were removing
the breathing apparatus

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.845 align:middle line:84%
and the sexual organs
primarily, because those

01:10:34.845 --> 01:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
were the areas they
were interested in,

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:39.140 align:middle line:84%
the breathing of the cows
and the sexual energy.

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
These were the primary things
that they were concerned with,

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
though there were other things.

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
They would sometimes remove
other organs and things out

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:46.635 align:middle line:90%
of them.

01:10:46.635 --> 01:10:47.926 align:middle line:90%
>>Did they also take the blood?

01:10:47.926 --> 01:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You said they took all
the red blood cells.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.134 align:middle line:84%
>>This was the final
clincher that she realized

01:10:55.134 --> 01:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that it couldn't have
been us, because there's

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
no technology on Earth
that could do this.

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Many, many, many of the
cows-- in fact, most of them--

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:07.330 align:middle line:84%
were found without one single
red blood cell in the body.

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Whoever it was removed
every single red blood

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
cell out of the body,
leaving not even one.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any technology
that can do that--

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:middle line:90%
nowhere.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.425 align:middle line:84%
And these abductions
or mutilations

01:11:21.425 --> 01:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of the cows were found
all over world everywhere,

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
even on isolated islands and
everywhere, though they were

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
mostly found on the border
between Colorado and New Mexico

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
because the main
underground base--

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and they had lots of these
huge underground bases--

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.130 align:middle line:90%
was in Dulce, New Mexico.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.934 align:middle line:84%
And it was convenient for
them to do that there.

01:11:40.934 --> 01:11:43.010 align:middle line:10%
They were interested
in the breathing,

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:48.000 align:middle line:10%
by the way, because
this breathing I

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.750 align:middle line:10%
talked about, how we were taking
the prana in through the mouth?

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
All of the animals that
we brought into us,

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.310 align:middle line:90%
that we cultivated--

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Domesticated?

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Domesticated.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Began to, by what's called
in physics resonance--

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
like if you took a
room full of clocks

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and you've got them swinging,
the most powerful one

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.415 align:middle line:84%
will very soon get
all the other clocks

01:12:11.415 --> 01:12:13.760 align:middle line:90%
swinging exactly the same.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And so us humans are
very powerful breathers.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.307 align:middle line:84%
And as we brought
these animals into us--

01:12:19.307 --> 01:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
the cows and the dogs and the
horses and all these other

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.440 align:middle line:90%
ones--

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
they began to breath
just like we did.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was for this
reason that they

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
began to do the
experiments on the cows,

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because they were the ones that
we had the closest link with,

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
because we ingest them as
well as having close to us.

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.196 align:middle line:90%
>>What are they doing now?

01:12:38.196 --> 01:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, at one point they
began to then switch to humans

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and begin to abduct human beings
and do experiments on them,

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.780 align:middle line:90%
primarily sexual experiments.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And they took hundreds of
thousands of them and did

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%
experiments, and then began
to take hundreds upon hundreds

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of thousands-- it's
up into the millions--

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of people, literally take
them right off the Earth

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:04.440 align:middle line:84%
onto fourth-dimensional
levels and aboard their ships,

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and took the sperm from some
of the males and the ovaries

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
from some of the
females, and combined it

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
with their sperm
and their ovaries

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and put them into
the females, and then

01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
when the baby was three
or four months old

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
would take the baby
out and bring it

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
onto the ships aboard the
fourth-dimensional level

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and raise them in test
tube type situations.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.537 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way they
can reproduce right now.

01:13:29.537 --> 01:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
That's their normal
way from doing it.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They have no
ability to procreate

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.360 align:middle line:90%
in a normal, natural way.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this what some of the
missing children might be?

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of the
children, the hundreds

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of children
that are just gone,

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:44.430 align:middle line:90%
are taken from them.

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And many, many people that are
just gone are taken from them.

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And they have created
an entirely new race.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And their intention
originally was

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate all the
humans on the Earth

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and to replace us
with this new race,

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
though it's highly unlikely
that that will take place

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.480 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's zero chance,
though they will attempt to.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Why is that unlikely?

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Only because I know what
the future's going to be.

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
But they will attempt.

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And Armageddon is part of
what that will all be about.

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
They were forced to leave Earth.

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They've now set up
their bases on Mars.

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:30.929 align:middle line:84%
And our governments
are aware of this now,

01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
though I can't get
into this all now.

01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
They are aware
that they're there.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.312 align:middle line:84%
And our outer governments-- not
the inner secret governments

01:14:38.312 --> 01:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
which were aware of
this a long time ago,

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but the outer
governments and NASA,

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.950 align:middle line:90%
are aware of the situation.

01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:47.610 align:middle line:90%


01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But I will rather discuss this
in detail in the workshop.

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of
abductions that we were

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.730 align:middle line:84%
seeing, I guess it was
in the '70s and '80s,

01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
when people were
being abducted--

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.740 align:middle line:90%
is that going on now?

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it still going on?

01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Very, very little.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are not able to enter
into our atmosphere except

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
for very short periods of time.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain this right now,
but Earth is making them sick.

01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there is still
few isolated experiments

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.900 align:middle line:90%
that they can do.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But the massive experiments
that they were able to do before

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.020 align:middle line:84%
is now no longer
possible for them.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
But it is also not
necessary for them,

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:29.350 align:middle line:84%
because they have
created this race

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:31.066 align:middle line:90%
that they needed to create.

01:15:31.066 --> 01:15:38.340 align:middle line:90%


01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:41.107 align:middle line:84%
>>What do you think about some
of these disaster predictions

01:15:41.107 --> 01:15:41.940 align:middle line:90%
that have been made?

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.523 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people around talking

01:15:43.523 --> 01:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
about earthquakes and natural
disasters, and poles shifting.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
opinions on that?

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.630 align:middle line:10%
>>First of all, there
have been many predictions

01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:56.281 align:middle line:10%
from a long time ago--
people like Edgar Cayce, who

01:15:56.281 --> 01:15:57.780 align:middle line:10%
was one of the first
ones to predict

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:02.480 align:middle line:10%
the shifting of the polls, and
Nostradamus and other people

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.370 align:middle line:10%
who have made these predictions.

01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:07.770 align:middle line:84%
But the events
that have happened

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:10.110 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth in
the last few years,

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and specifically since the
explosion of the sun in August

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
of 1972, have altered the
course of events in such a way

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that predictions are
not accurate anymore.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a new turn of events
occurring on the Earth now,

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
the likes of which
no one in existence

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:37.690 align:middle line:90%
anywhere has ever seen before.

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that does not fit

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
into any of the
patterns that are

01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
known by any life on any
level of existence at all.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It appears as though God
is intervening directly

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
on Earth in a unique way
to create something--

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.370 align:middle line:90%
whatever God loves to create--

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that is different
than what anyone

01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:07.700 align:middle line:90%
who has seen into the future.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And so predictions are highly
unreliable at this point.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:18.870 align:middle line:84%
For example, Edgar
Cayce was almost 100%

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.820 align:middle line:84%
accurate until 1972,
and then [SOUND EFFECT],,

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.030 align:middle line:90%
he dropped way off.

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:26.390 align:middle line:10%
Nostradamus was about
80% accurate until 1972,

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:28.370 align:middle line:10%
and then [SOUND EFFECT],,
dropped way off.

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And so were a lot of the
predictions from various people

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.681 align:middle line:84%
who had made these predictions
before that time about things

01:17:33.681 --> 01:17:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that would happen and
when the poles would shift

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.950 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean a thing anymore.

01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.490 align:middle line:90%
We're in freefall.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
We're changing at
rates and in ways

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:49.810 align:middle line:84%
that are impossible by
normal ways of thinking.

01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can't tell it, because
we're inside the system.

01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the
incredible speed

01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that evolution is moving
at, because we're inside

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.200 align:middle line:90%
the system that's moving.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.800 align:middle line:84%
If we were outside
the system, we

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.605 align:middle line:84%
would be in awe at what's
happy here on Earth.

01:18:06.605 --> 01:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you think there
will be a pole shift?

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.950 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah, that's
almost inevitable.

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:15.070 align:middle line:10%
There will be a pole shift,
though the kinds of violence

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.620 align:middle line:10%
that normally are associated
with a pole shift--

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.520 align:middle line:10%
the continents
going up and down,

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.110 align:middle line:10%
and huge tidal waves that
are hundreds of feet high,

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:30.470 align:middle line:10%
and huge blocks of the entire
south pole moving toward

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.490 align:middle line:10%
the equator at 1,700 miles
an hour and these kinds

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:34.650 align:middle line:10%
of things--

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:36.450 align:middle line:10%
this may occur.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But because of the nature of
the changes that are happening

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and because of something
that I can't quite

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
explain about who
we are becoming

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and what we are becoming
aware about ourselves

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to control
the reality as a planet,

01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
we may find that the
environment, even

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
though the poles may
shift, may not be

01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:01.200 align:middle line:90%
nearly as violent as we think.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And we may find ourselves--

01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
it could possibly actually be
a very beautiful experience.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.920 align:middle line:90%
That's very possible.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.230 align:middle line:90%
My feeling on this--

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is going to go against
what a lot of people think--

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:17.964 align:middle line:84%
there are many people
saying, go out and dig holes

01:19:17.964 --> 01:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
in the ground, put
lots and lots of food

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and guns and ammunition,
and hold on for the worst

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
because all hell's
about to break those.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So really, what you're
preparing for is

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that time right before
the poles shift,

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
because when the
poles shift we will

01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
go through an electromagnetic
null zone for about three

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and a half days, and
then after that time

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.712 align:middle line:84%
be on a totally different
dimensional level of the Earth

01:19:38.712 --> 01:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
whereby anything that's
happening on this level

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:42.340 align:middle line:90%
won't make any difference.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
That's preparation prior to
the time when all the systems--

01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:48.039 align:middle line:84%
the social systems,
the financial systems,

01:19:48.039 --> 01:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and all these kinds of
things-- break down,

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
which is real normal
for them to break down.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that why everything's
breaking down now?

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.730 align:middle line:90%
It is heading in that direction.

01:19:57.730 --> 01:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But there will come
a time, probably,

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
when the breakdown
will be complete

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:07.600 align:middle line:90%
and the streets will be wild.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And you will be able to see this
in the electromagnetic fields

01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The scientists will be
able to see the correlation

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
in the magnetic field that
will be directly linked

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.000 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on in there.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>And talking about the
poles shifting, what do you

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
recommend people to
do to be prepared

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%
to deal with this coming thing?

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:31.822 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it doesn't really hurt
to prepare on a physical level,

01:20:31.822 --> 01:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
to get the food
and everything else

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that you may need
in an emergency.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But that in itself is
not going to get you out

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:43.322 align:middle line:90%
into the higher levels.

01:20:43.322 --> 01:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>You can't eat your
way out of this one.

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>There's no way.

01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:46.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that implies that
if you can just hang on

01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
long enough, when you
get to the other side

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.560 align:middle line:90%
you'll be able to walk out.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And as the governments
have found,

01:20:57.090 --> 01:20:58.673 align:middle line:84%
and especially the
secret governments,

01:20:58.673 --> 01:20:59.990 align:middle line:90%
that just isn't true.

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going through a
dimensional consciousness

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:03.170 align:middle line:90%
change.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And though that may
help a little tiny bit

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning as we
pass through these changes,

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
the only real help
is who you are,

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
what your character is, how
much your heart is open,

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and how well you are able to
love and to connect with God.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the most
important work is

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
working on your inner
self of who you are.

01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
This is more important
than preparing with food.

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the little bit of
time that we have left,

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
this is the area that we
suggest that you work with.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have very
specific instructions

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:48.122 align:middle line:84%
in the workshop on
exactly how to do this.

01:21:48.122 --> 01:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>And will you tell people how
to recognize the signs of it

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.270 align:middle line:90%
coming, or will they know?

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>We will give what
normally occurs,

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.785 align:middle line:84%
what life has seen on other
planets in other places that

01:21:58.785 --> 01:21:59.745 align:middle line:90%
are similar to this--

01:21:59.745 --> 01:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
we could tell you
what normally occurs.

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:04.200 align:middle line:84%
However, because the
situation is so unusual,

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
we cannot tell you
what's going to happen.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
that a lot of people

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
are waiting for
the poles to shift

01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:13.770 align:middle line:84%
or waiting for this
big change to happen.

01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And their thoughts are
so much into the future,

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.776 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
preparation for the future,

01:22:20.776 --> 01:22:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that that is a
hindrance in itself.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.480 align:middle line:84%
The only place that any kind
of true change can take place

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is here and now at
this very moment.

01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's much
more important to not

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.710 align:middle line:84%
be so concerned about
when it's going to happen.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So you know it's
going to happen.

01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But to shift your focus
back to the present time

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to make changes
within yourself at this time,

01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
because you can't make
changes in the future.

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
You can only make
them here and now.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it even possible that,
with enough people focusing

01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness in
a different way, what

01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
we expect might
happen may not even

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
happen the way we
expect it to be?

01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It may be something
totally unexpected.

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And then at this
point, I believe

01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:05.410 align:middle line:84%
that's what's going
to happen, that we're

01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
going to see something
that nobody ever

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.670 align:middle line:90%
thought was going to occur.

01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And I will go into
what I see occur.

01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the ascended masters of
the Earth and many other levels

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that are
associated with the Earth.

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
They see something
happening that

01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is truly extraordinary
and very positive.

01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for
fear for what's coming up.

01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:35.060 align:middle line:90%
This is another thing.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Many of the people
are saying, look out.

01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
This horrible thing
is going to happen.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.330 align:middle line:90%
It's coming.

01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, there is a
death process occurring.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
birth process occurring

01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that is truly remarkable
and very beautiful.

01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you can identify
with the death process

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or you can identify
with the birth process.

01:23:56.070 --> 01:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And we suggest you identify
with the birth process,

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%
because what is about to occur--

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%


01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.340 align:middle line:84%
there just is no
reason to be afraid.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.740 align:middle line:90%
It is really beautiful.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And though it's
extraordinary, it's

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
well within the
realms of who we are

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to handle
these kinds of changes.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And when the time comes, each
person, wherever they are

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and whatever they have
available to them,

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.280 align:middle line:84%
will have everything
they need and will

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.790 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what
they need to know,

01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:38.797 align:middle line:90%
and will move forward perfectly.

01:24:38.797 --> 01:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to be
forgotten, and no one's

01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:42.320 align:middle line:90%
going to be left out.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not like the old vision
of the good guys will make it

01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and the bad guys
will stay behind?

01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>That's an aspect
of our consciousness,

01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
the polarity consciousness.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Polarity consciousness sees
everything as good and bad.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It sees there being the
great white brotherhood,

01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:01.735 align:middle line:84%
and it sees this
being the dark--

01:25:01.735 --> 01:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say the
light and dark,

01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:04.776 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean skin
color or anything.

01:25:04.776 --> 01:25:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about nature.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.047 align:middle line:84%
It sees there being
the beings of light

01:25:09.047 --> 01:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and the beings of
darkness, and that there's

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
this war going on between them
and the fighting that goes on.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.660 align:middle line:90%
But really there's only one god.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And God created all of it,
with purpose and meaning

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
behind all of it.

01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:25.309 align:middle line:84%
>>So if God created
the dark with meaning--

01:25:25.309 --> 01:25:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>God created everything.

01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything that God
didn't create on any level

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:29.930 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And from a higher-level
being outside

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of polarity consciousness,
these two forces

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:39.290 align:middle line:90%
actually work together.

01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And it has to do with timing.

01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The dark force will come
to a consciousness--

01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
it could be a person or a planet
or a solar system or a galaxy--

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.776 align:middle line:84%
and it will do everything it
can to keep it from evolving.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And the light force
will come in and do

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.250 align:middle line:90%
everything it can to evolve it.

01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And they appear to
be working together.

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is their
actions have a timing

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
element to it so that
the consciousness either

01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:14.170 align:middle line:84%
goes up or down depending
what God wishes,

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
whatever is the will of
God, at the right moment.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It keeps it from
going up or down

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.090 align:middle line:90%
until the right moment happens.

01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like in birth, you want a
baby to be born at nine months.

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it to
be born at five months,

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to
be born at six years.

01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you want it to
be born at nine months.

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And so timing is very important
in everything in life.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.071 align:middle line:84%
Springtime-- when the plants
come in, when they go,

01:26:44.071 --> 01:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
when the seasons
and anything else--

01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:47.440 align:middle line:90%
everything has its timing.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And the dark and light
forces moving together

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:52.450 align:middle line:84%
cause the timing of
all the events in life

01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:54.510 align:middle line:90%
to happen at the right time.

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
consciousness moving up,

01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:02.310 align:middle line:84%
the trials, the errors,
the temptations, the demons

01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and everything else,
and the darkness that

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:07.140 align:middle line:84%
happens around
them and the fears

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
that keep people from going
up, are very, very important,

01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
as well as the revelations and
the opening and the good things

01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that happen in life,
all these things

01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
blend together to
form who you are

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and who I am that allow us
to move at the right moment.

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>So then we really
don't need to be

01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:27.010 align:middle line:84%
afraid of the dark
force or the fear?

01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>At one point in our life,
yeah, the fear was important.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But we're coming to a
time when fear is not

01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
important-- in fact,
is not desirable.

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:39.530 align:middle line:84%
There will be a time when a
letting go of fear and a moving

01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
into the higher levels
will happen to all of us,

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and there will be this
opening that I could only

01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
describe with words
that would never be--

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
there's no way to
actually describe

01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
an experience on something that
isn't in our consciousness.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But we will come to
this stage one time

01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:05.225 align:middle line:90%
when we will go beyond fear.

01:28:05.225 --> 01:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>But you don't mean
by this that there

01:28:06.850 --> 01:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is no difference
between light and dark,

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that there's still
significance as

01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to what choice you make in terms
of where you put your energy?

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>It is important that we
strive to reach the highest

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
ideal that we can reach,
and to resist the dark

01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
and to move into the light.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.500 align:middle line:90%
This is our nature.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Our nature of who we are as
humans is to try to make this--

01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that you can just
go out there and do anything.

01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean at all.

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I just mean that hidden
behind all of this

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
is another nature that is beyond
what we can really normally

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.540 align:middle line:90%
talk about in good and evil.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, we still
need to strive and to--

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Are there people who have
chosen one path or another?

01:28:49.630 --> 01:28:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>There are people
who have decided

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.380 align:middle line:90%
to work for the dark forces.

01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, I've decided
to work with the Great White

01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Brotherhood of
the Earth in order

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:05.240 align:middle line:84%
to bring forth the grid,
which is their main purpose

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and function, to bring
in the right-brain aspect

01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:13.660 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this a critical
time on Earth

01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:17.100 align:middle line:84%
now with this grid
being completed

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and all these changes
that are occurring?

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the truly
critical time, the time

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:25.090 align:middle line:84%
when a lot of higher levels
of consciousness of the Earth

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:29.780 align:middle line:84%
were very concerned whether
or not we would even make it

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:33.270 align:middle line:90%
as a planet, we're beyond that.

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We're now onto a plateau
of consciousness.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.370 align:middle line:90%
We will definitely make it.

01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:41.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, put it another
way, we've already made it.

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.524 align:middle line:84%
It's now a matter of
living it, though it's hard

01:29:44.524 --> 01:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
when you look out into the Earth
and see all the stuff going on.

01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:49.010 align:middle line:90%
It looks like, we've made it?

01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like we made it
with all the problems going on.

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But on a fourth-dimensional
level and even higher,

01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
the earth has reached a level
that is, you might say, safe.

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like when a
baby reaches a certain level

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:08.220 align:middle line:90%
of gestation, then it's OK now.

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
If it is born now, it
will still make it.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And we are in that state.

01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:14.910 align:middle line:90%
We have made it as a planet.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.270 align:middle line:90%
We will make it through.

01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:19.260 align:middle line:90%
We will survive.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Except that it's now
looking like we're

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.960 align:middle line:84%
going to go beyond the
expectation of just

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.070 align:middle line:90%
mere survival.

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We may go very rapidly
into extremely high levels

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:34.900 align:middle line:84%
No one really knows,
but it looks like that's

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:36.220 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.280 align:middle line:10%
>>If you're trained in
this Merkabah breathing,

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.530 align:middle line:10%
will you have a better shot
of making it through this?

01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:45.290 align:middle line:10%
>>If you know how to
create the living Merkabah

01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:49.910 align:middle line:10%
field around your body, which
is by counter-rotating fields

01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:53.420 align:middle line:10%
of energy created by your
thoughts and your emotions

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:56.670 align:middle line:10%
that creates a disk
that extends 55 feet out

01:30:56.670 --> 01:31:00.270 align:middle line:10%
from your base of your
spine around a sphere that

01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:02.480 align:middle line:10%
actually looks, on
a computer screen,

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.615 align:middle line:10%
just like a flying saucer.

01:31:03.615 --> 01:31:04.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:07.090 align:middle line:90%
It looks just like one.

01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:10.560 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the Merkabah,
your thoughts and your feelings

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.520 align:middle line:84%
become thousands of times more
powerful than they are now

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and you are able to create
a magnetic field that

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.800 align:middle line:84%
will keep your
memories intact so

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that as you pass
through these fields

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.730 align:middle line:84%
you become immortal
from that definition

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and there is no
break in your memory.

01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, what
happens to most people

01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:35.230 align:middle line:84%
when the magnetic
field collapses,

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:38.050 align:middle line:84%
their memories and
their mind are erased

01:31:38.050 --> 01:31:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
start all over again.

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And they go back and they take--

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>It's like reincarnation.

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's not
exactly reincarnation.

01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation is jumping
from the same place upward.

01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
This is [SWOOSH] all the
way back to beginning.

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like unplugging
a computer when you've got

01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:58.710 align:middle line:90%
all your programming in there.

01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:00.240 align:middle line:90%
You'll lose it.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.920 align:middle line:90%
And so the Merkabah will-

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>It's like Save
on the computer.

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:04.955 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it's like Save.

01:32:04.955 --> 01:32:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't lose it.

01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to move
through the dimensional levels

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:09.410 align:middle line:90%
without any--

01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:12.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll remember this, everything
that's your new memory.

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You'll be aware all
the way through,

01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.992 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be aware of
the other side also.

01:32:16.992 --> 01:32:18.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Can you take someone
with you if you're

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.120 align:middle line:10%
trained in this Merkabah?

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're trained in
certain levels of the Merkabah

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
experience, two people can bring
approximately 150,000 people

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.410 align:middle line:90%
with them.

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Without that
particular training,

01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:32.900 align:middle line:84%
which is not given
in this workshop--

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
you are first trained on
individual understanding

01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
of this, and that can
only bring yourself.

01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you going to later
maybe teach the other?

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>That's up to God.

01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:50.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:52.790 align:middle line:90%
The key to the Merkabah is love.

01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The Greys can't do it, because
they don't know what love is.

01:32:58.310 --> 01:33:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole key is to
be able to open your heart

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to unconditional
love to all life.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, then
the counter-rotating fields

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.340 align:middle line:84%
will balance against the
thoughts and the knowledge

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and be able to create
a living field.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Without the love, if you
can't open your heart,

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.750 align:middle line:90%
then you can't perceive.

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, though we give the
understanding of all of this,

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
for some people they may have to
go into other training programs

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:33.978 align:middle line:84%
to begin to open that
aspect of themselves.

01:33:33.978 --> 01:33:40.740 align:middle line:90%


01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>What about the children
who are being born now?

01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Why are they coming in, and
do they have this training

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and do they have
this information?

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Starting in 1972 also,
there were a small group

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of children that were
born on the Earth that

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
became the apex of
a huge pyramid that

01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:05.650 align:middle line:84%
kept growing and growing
and growing that is now

01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:09.360 align:middle line:90%
encompassing the whole Earth.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I can almost say that
every single child being

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:18.000 align:middle line:84%
born at this moment is a very,
very unusual person, a very

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.390 align:middle line:84%
high interdimensional being from
another level of existence that

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:25.470 align:middle line:84%
is beyond our ability to
communicate who they really

01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:26.470 align:middle line:90%
are.

01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are millions
of these children

01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
being born every minute
all over the planet now.

01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:36.020 align:middle line:84%
There are millions upon millions
upon millions of these children

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that have that form this pyramid
that, at the right moment,

01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
will awaken as a single
body of consciousness

01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and will affect the whole Earth.

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, they already started
to awaken in 1985.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You can go back to the article
of Omni Magazine in January

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of 1985 and see what Omni
magazine has discovered

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.170 align:middle line:84%
about the children of China
and these incredibly psychic

01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:03.970 align:middle line:90%
children.

01:35:03.970 --> 01:35:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
children in China--

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and Omni magazine
has verified this--

01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that were able to do things
like take a group of them

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
in a room--

01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:20.482 align:middle line:84%
and Omni magazine assumed
that it was all a hoax

01:35:20.482 --> 01:35:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that these kids
were really psychic

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.610 align:middle line:90%
like the government said--

01:35:23.610 --> 01:35:27.071 align:middle line:84%
and they would take a
book, and they would just

01:35:27.071 --> 01:35:29.570 align:middle line:84%
flip through it, rip out a page,
crumple it up, and stick it

01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:31.020 align:middle line:90%
under their arm.

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And all these kids could read
every single word on there.

01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't make one
single error at all.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.529 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
they tested them,

01:35:41.529 --> 01:35:43.320 align:middle line:84%
the more that they
realized that this isn't

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.290 align:middle line:90%
just ordinary psychic ability.

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a flawless perfect
psychic ability.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And there were hundreds if not
thousands of these children.

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, now there's millions upon
millions upon millions of them

01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.700 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Every country.

01:35:57.570 --> 01:35:58.945 align:middle line:84%
>>All over the
world, though they

01:35:58.945 --> 01:36:04.000 align:middle line:84%
are mostly in China, Japan,
United States, Canada, Europe,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Russia, and more on
the northern aspect

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
than on the southern
aspect of the world.

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And though I'm not real sure,
because I haven't followed this

01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:16.470 align:middle line:84%
lately, if that's now extending
into the southern hemisphere

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it's
now everywhere.

01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:24.690 align:middle line:84%
There is no more
reincarnation going on.

01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:27.180 align:middle line:84%
This is our last
life for everybody.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:28.680 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Most people think,
I've been reincarnating

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:31.980 align:middle line:84%
for a long, long,
long, long time.

01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.900 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.950 align:middle line:84%
This is your last
time in human form.

01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And though there may
be a few exceptions,

01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:43.760 align:middle line:84%
all the children and all
the life coming in now

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
are very high
interdimensional beings,

01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and when the time
is right, the world

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is about to see something rather
remarkable take place coming

01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:53.862 align:middle line:90%
from the children of the Earth.

01:36:53.862 --> 01:37:04.204 align:middle line:90%


01:37:04.204 --> 01:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>How are you going to get
all this information out?

01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to get
this out to the world?

01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>The real way that this
will go into the world

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is through people who
live it and make it real.

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:18.710 align:middle line:84%
They in turn live it and put
it into the grid, from which

01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:22.670 align:middle line:84%
the people of the world
will become aware of it

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:26.530 align:middle line:84%
through their internal aspect
and through their dreams.

01:37:26.530 --> 01:37:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And they will think that it's
coming from within themselves,

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.560 align:middle line:84%
though it's really coming
from within themselves

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.340 align:middle line:90%
as an Earth body.

01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:39.350 align:middle line:84%
However, what I've
been directed to do now

01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:46.080 align:middle line:84%
is to allow this to
come out in a video form

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.200 align:middle line:84%
so that it can be taught by
other people around the world.

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to start
a facilitator program where

01:37:53.530 --> 01:37:57.120 align:middle line:84%
people, though it's become
impossible for people to see me

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.880 align:middle line:84%
because I'm booked solid for
another year and there's no way

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
people can any longer get
into a direct living class,

01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:16.090 align:middle line:84%
so in April 1993 we
videoed a living workshop

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:17.660 align:middle line:90%
in Dallas, Texas.

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about
52 hours of video

01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:24.300 align:middle line:84%
of all of this information
in great detail.

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And those videos are now
going to be shown by people

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
all around the world who
have been to the workshops

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and who understand
what this is about

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and who have been practicing
the meditation so that people,

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.860 align:middle line:84%
though they aren't able to
come and see me personally,

01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
will be able to see it
through these videos.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I think one of the things that
I felt in a seminar was that

01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:49.650 align:middle line:84%
what was happening
on an external level

01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:52.577 align:middle line:84%
or what was happening on
a level of the left brain

01:38:52.577 --> 01:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
was just a small piece
of what was going on,

01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that what was going on was all
of the interdimensional work

01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and all the shifting
that occurred.

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
That was really what
the workshop was about.

01:39:01.130 --> 01:39:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>It is.

01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:03.610 align:middle line:84%
The information
that is presented

01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:07.750 align:middle line:84%
is really the least important
aspect of this work.

01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The most important
is what takes place

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.010 align:middle line:84%
between you and
your higher self,

01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and the dimensional releases
and changes that go on.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.146 align:middle line:84%
That will go on even
if you're with videos

01:39:18.146 --> 01:39:19.020 align:middle line:90%
or if you're with me.

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.055 align:middle line:84%
It won't matter, because it's
God that's directing this

01:39:22.055 --> 01:39:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and it has nothing to
do with me personally.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And so these workshops should
be able to function just as

01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:35.470 align:middle line:84%
well from a video as
they do from me sitting

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:36.940 align:middle line:90%
there and actually doing it.

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>You've also said that once a
person's memory is activated,

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
they won't need you or
any teacher anymore.

01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Once their connection
with higher self

01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:50.610 align:middle line:84%
takes place, which is just
them on another level,

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:54.150 align:middle line:84%
then at that point all the
guidance that they need

01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:57.250 align:middle line:84%
during this time and all the
times that will then come,

01:39:57.250 --> 01:40:02.290 align:middle line:84%
they will no longer need
me or teachers like me.

01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.410 align:middle line:84%
They will be able to
get their inner guidance

01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:06.890 align:middle line:90%
from within themselves.

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just a stepping
stone to this level,

01:40:09.190 --> 01:40:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and after that they don't need
me anymore, or anything else.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:17.140 align:middle line:84%
They will be able to know
whatever they need to know,

01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and they will know how to
access whatever they need

01:40:20.050 --> 01:40:22.727 align:middle line:90%
to know from within themselves.

01:40:22.727 --> 01:40:23.701 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:34.920 align:middle line:90%


01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
is your purpose?

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:38.480 align:middle line:90%
What have you come here to do?

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I'm not real important
in terms of all of this,

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:46.880 align:middle line:84%
except that my main purpose
was to simply witness

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and to watch this so that it
goes back to the Melchizedek

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
levels of consciousness, and to
just view what's happening here

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.520 align:middle line:90%
because it's so unusual.

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But my second
purpose was to remind

01:41:03.330 --> 01:41:06.720 align:middle line:84%
the Earth of the Merkabah so
that we could remember what

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that was, because it
is important for us

01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
to remember the Merkabah
fields so that we can make

01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:15.810 align:middle line:84%
this translation in
a smooth, easy way,

01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:18.240 align:middle line:84%
because we need
that remembrance.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.220 align:middle line:90%
It's the key to everything.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And on kind of personal
level, although it also

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:32.470 align:middle line:84%
has its cosmic level to it,
I'm studying relationships--

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
those are the only three
things that I'm doing.

01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:41.740 align:middle line:84%
My work in terms of the Merkabah
is on one level just beginning,

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:44.470 align:middle line:90%
but for me it's closing.

01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And another level of this will
be brought forth pretty soon.

01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:53.555 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
all I'm here to do.

01:41:53.555 --> 01:41:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The children are
the ones who are

01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:59.018 align:middle line:84%
going to make the real
changes in the world.

01:41:59.018 --> 01:42:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, Druvalo, thank
you for this work.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
presenting it to us.

01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>You're welcome.

01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:09.800 align:middle line:90%
