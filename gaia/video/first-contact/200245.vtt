that they might
actually communicate

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Can I prove that the
ship was Bashar's craft?

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:90%
No, of course not.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I can't even prove that it
came from another world.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But if we have the ability to
create that kind of technology,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
a ship that can hover silently
and take off like a speeding

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
bullet without any visible
means of propulsion

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and without making a
sound, then somebody

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
has been able to keep that
technology a complete secret

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
from the public for the past
40 years since the sighting.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's assume for the moment
that the unidentified flying

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
object they witnessed was
in fact an extraterrestrial

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:90%
spacecraft.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
If so, it raises
several questions.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible for
ETs to travel hundreds

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:90%
of light years to Earth?

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Why do so many
reports of ET beings

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:90%
say they look similar to us?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
If they are here, why don't they
land openly and make contact?

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
This documentary will
address these questions

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and many others.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But the answers may be far more
unexpected than we imagine.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:10%
Channeling, UFOs, and ETs have
been controversial subjects

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:10%
for decades, sparking heated
debates between believers

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:10%
and debunkers.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:10%
Of course, no photo or film
can offer absolute proof

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:10%
that such things are real.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:10%
However, some of the
information introduced

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:10%
by Bashar, the ET being
reportedly channeled

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:10%
by Darryl Anka, has
already impacted

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:10%
the lives of thousands of people
around the globe since 1984.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.740 align:middle line:84%
These messages contain new
insights and perspectives

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
regarding the nature
of consciousness,

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
theories of physics and
possibly a glimpse into a larger

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
The only thing required for
this journey is an open mind.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The first question-- what
exactly is channeling?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Channeling is a
natural, altered state.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
the ability to do it.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we all do
it from time to time

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
if somebody is doing
what they love to do,

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
following their
passion in the zone.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
That's a channeling state
when you're doing something,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're totally
caught up in it,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.532 align:middle line:84%
and you're not paying attention
to the passage of time.

00:11:52.532 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems like five
minutes has gone by.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:90%
You look up.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It's been three hours.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a channeling state.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
A painter who paints
a painting who's

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
focused on that
and nothing else,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
a singer that's
lost in the song,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
an actor who becomes the
character, an athlete

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.415 align:middle line:84%
at the peak of
their performance,

00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:11.968 align:middle line:84%
a teacher passionate
about educating students.

00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that's most important to

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
me is to demystify this whole
concept of what channeling is.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it is not
outside the realm

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:90%
of normal human experience.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Channels and mediums have
existed in many cultures

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
The Oracle at Delphi
is one famous example

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Greece.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The people of that time would
rely on such seers and mystics

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
for guidance in both
personal and worldly matters.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The Bible tells the
story of King Saul who

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
asked a medium in
the city of Endor

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
to call upon the spirit of
the prophet Samuel for advice.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
In more modern times,
a psychic called

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce, known to many
as the sleeping prophet,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
delivered thousands of
messages and information while

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:90%
in trance.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Today, that
information is archived

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:84%
at the Association for
Research and Enlightenment

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:90%
in Virginia Beach.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Many point to a woman
named Jane Roberts

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
as the first modern
channel who, in the 1960s,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
is said to have brought through
a spirit entity known as Seth.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:10%
>> It is only when you do not
know yourself that you fear you

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:10%
are evil and afraid to
look within yourself.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:10%
But when you open
up those doors,

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:10%
you are amazed by the
immensity and the grace

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:10%
of your own being.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> One day I was introduced
to a channel named Tom Massaro

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.482 align:middle line:90%
at a public channeling event.

00:13:45.482 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I went to listen for a while.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.815 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the information
was very interesting.

00:13:48.815 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
very helpful information

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to have
the ability to help

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
people make positive
changes in their lives.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
the entity actually

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
offered to teach a
channeling class.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
how is that possible?

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought channeling
was something

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:90%
that just happened to someone.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.268 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it was something
you could teach or learn.

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I went into the class
not because I thought

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I was going to become a
channel, but just because I

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:90%
wanted to further my research.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
However, during one of
the guided meditations

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
in the class, I
experienced what I can only

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
call a telepathic contact
from Bashar and his people.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that one instant,
a memory actually

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:84%
came back of having
made an agreement

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
before this life with Bashar
to do this channeling with him.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I understood in that
instant that the UFO

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
had been shown to
me by him on purpose

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
to get me to start
learning, start questioning,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
start finding out
what was going on.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And it led me to
learn about channeling

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
so that when the
time came to fulfill

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
the agreement I had
made to channel Bashar,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I would be ready.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.845 align:middle line:84%
I'd have enough information
so that I wouldn't be scared.

00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I would know how
to move forward.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I would understand
that channeling

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:90%
was beneficial to people.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, well, first--

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- am
I hallucinating?

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is this a side
effect of the meditation?

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Is this real?

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it my imagination?

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But in that one instant this
was going on in my head--

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't telling anyone--

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
the entity coming
through the teacher

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:84%
stopped talking to the
class and turned right to me

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and said there is an entity
here for you right now if you're

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:90%
ready to begin.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:90%
That was startling.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And even more startling,
I glanced over,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that one of
the other classmates

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
somehow had picked up
on the image of Bashar

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
I saw in my head.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually sketching
it on a piece of paper.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, OK, this
is not just my imagination.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
There's two outside
validations here

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
that something
real is happening.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The question that
remained, though--

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
was Bashar really
a separate entity?

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Or was I just tapping
into another aspect

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:90%
of my own consciousness?

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Either way, I realized that
if I pursued the channeling,

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I would be exploring
uncharted waters.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Along with the
events in the class,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:10%
the UFO sighting suggested
that Bashar might truly

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:10%
be an independent entity.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But mainstream
society and the media

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
usually ridicule
people who report UFOs.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
What would they say if
I said that an alien was

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:90%
speaking through me?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the class, I
was approached by a woman

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
named Margo Chandley.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And she was writing
a doctoral thesis

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
on the connection between
channeling and psychology.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And I became one of the subjects
that she studied for her paper.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So she would invite
me to her house,

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.128 align:middle line:84%
and she would
invite friends over.

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And I would channel for
them while she took notes

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
in order to write her thesis.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.595 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first week
there were five friends.

00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the next week
there were 10 friends.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And word of mouth started to
spread that this was going on.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there were 20
friends and 30 friends.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And before we knew it, I had to
start channeling twice a week

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:90%
to accommodate everyone.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we had to start
holding public events in order

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:90%
to handle the crowds.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And word of mouth
kept spreading.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I found
myself channeling in cities

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:84%
And so, really, my
public channeling career

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:90%
started in 1984 with Margo.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Did I choose this path from
a higher level of existence

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
before I entered this life
as Bashar has proposed?

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
When I think about it,
there were hints and signs.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Most were subtle, but one
in particular stands out.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:10%
When I was little, we lived
in this old West Hollywood

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:10%
apartment building.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:90%
One day, dad was at work.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Mom was in the kitchen.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing by
myself in the living room.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, this small
swirling whirlpool of light

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:84%
appeared and floated in
front of me in mid-air.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:90%
It just hung there.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I remember being
transfixed and feeling

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
like it was some kind of
window to somewhere else.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually
hear a voice, but it

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
felt like someone was sending
me a message from the other side

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
of the light.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Looking back now, I
wonder if that moment is

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:90%
where my journey really began.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> When Darryl first made
his connection to Bashar

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and started to channel, it was
a little challenging for him,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
because of Bashar's
intense energy.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:10%
And as I watched Darryl
work to get out of the way

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:10%
to let Bashar's
energy come through,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:10%
I realized that it was just
Bashar's passion and excitement

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:10%
in bringing through the ideas
that he wanted to share.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But most of all,
I loved his humor.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a member of SETI.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:10%
Do you know SETI?

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, we understand.

is funny about us?

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> What isn't?

>> I'm such a dreamer.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I dream of
meeting my true love.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You dream of
meeting your true love?

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Look in the mirror.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.868 align:middle line:90%

bit eccentric, but--

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:10%

>> --I was wondering--

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:10%
>> A bit eccentric?

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because talking to an
alien through a human is not

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:90%
eccentric enough.

[LAUGHTER]

00:19:18.878 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you have films
in your reality?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we just come watch you.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, perfect.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Before I started
working with Bashar,

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:10%
I had a very
traditional work life.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:10%
I had careers in
banking and finance,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:10%
as a university
professor, and also

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:10%
as a psychological counselor.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1985 as part of my
exploration of psychology,

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I happened upon a lecture being
given by Bashar at an expo.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Upon hearing him
speak, I was so amazed

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
at the clarity and the
cutting-edge nature

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
of the psychological
information he was providing.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
From that point
forward, my life moved

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
bringing together

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:84%
all of my business experience,
all of my teaching experience,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and all of my counseling
experience into one

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
form of work that incorporated
everything that I had learned.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I became so passionate about
sharing Bashar's information

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
as a way of helping to improve
the lives of both the people

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and the animals on our planet.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> While it's possible for
a channel to filter or color

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
a telepathic message, I think
the most important thing is

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the message
rather than the messenger.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Is the information empowering
or is it controlling?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Is it love based or fear based?

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Is it integrative
or disconnecting?

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it positive or negative?

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the bottom line
is use the information that

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.568 align:middle line:84%
works for you, that
speaks to your heart

00:21:01.568 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and just leave the rest behind.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:84%
The channeling class taught
me to alter my brainwaves

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:90%
to match Bashar's frequency.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
He does the same
thing on his ship.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in the middle, our
vibrations meet and harmonize.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
When they do, my body becomes
like a biological resonator.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And my personality
starts to mirror his.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:10%
>> That's an EEG cap.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be
recording your brainwaves

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:10%
as we measure various states
that we'll be exploring today.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And looking up here,
we can see that each

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of the electrodes that we
have hooked up on that cap

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
have achieved a level of
impedance that is accurate

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and that will properly
record the brainwaves

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:90%
without interference.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning
of the channeling,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the channel was capable of
holding on to, shall we say,

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or bringing through the idea of
about 1.5 to 2% of our energy.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:10%
In the ensuing years following
the initiation of contact

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:10%
with the channel, it
was thus then capable

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:10%
in the channel's body of
expressing our energy up

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:10%
to about 3%.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:10%
On average now, we are
expressing about 5%

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:10%
of our total energy.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're looking at a picture
of Darryl's baseline EEG.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:10%
And what I've done is to
record Darryl's baseline when

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:10%
he is not channeling and
compare that to his EEG

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:10%
when he is channeling.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, here is a picture of
Darryl's raw EEG baseline

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:10%
again, in which we see a
very rounded and rhythmic,

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:10%
dominant frequency, we call
it, in the posterior cortex

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:10%
or the back of the head.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And this is a good finding.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a positive finding.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it tells us that
Darryl's nervous system is

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:84%
stable and also
that he has what we

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
call good thalamocortical
functioning.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is a common
feature, a characteristic

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
that is found in individuals
who are peak performers.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have a picture
of what disconnects

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:90%
when Darryl begins to channel.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the areas in
blue, the functional Brodmann

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
areas, we call them, that are
not used when he is channeling.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And it appears
that he disconnects

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:90%
from his personal sense of self.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
He disconnects from
the experience of pain.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, what increases when
he begins to channel

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all,
his processing speed.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And processing speed is a
very interesting phenomenon.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is it
develops early in childhood.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And by about the age of 5 or 6
and certainly 9 or 10 maximum,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
we reach a set point.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And this set point
doesn't usually

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:90%
change during the lifetime.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And in Darryl's
case, it actually

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
went up when he
began to channel.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And it increased
when he listened.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The actual frequency
of the processing speed

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
was tuned to an exact
frequency all over the brain.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're looking at
Darryl's anterior cingulate

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:90%
while he's channeling.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
red areas there.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:10%
There is actually
gamma frequencies

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:10%
that I found in his
anterior cingulate.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And gamma frequencies
relate to the higher mind.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And gamma frequencies are
often found in Tibetan monks

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and people who meditate a lot.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
To summarize what I found
here and in Darryl's brain

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:84%
in comparison with
the channeling state,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:84%
he starts from a very
stable resting state.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And then he experiences changes
that statistically less than 1%

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.410 align:middle line:84%
of the population would
experience in the same way.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:84%
He increases his
processing speed.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
He tunes it exquisitely to one
frequency all over the brain.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he's able to
create a resonant holding

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
environment for the peak
performance or the channeling

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:84%
He pumps energy into
the right frontal cortex

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and the right auditory cortex
so that he can empathize

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and hear very, very clearly.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And because of the gamma
frequencies in the anterior

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:90%
cingulate, he can shift gears.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
He'll be able to shift gears and
navigate cognition, thoughts,

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and emotions very,
very flexibly.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And he'll be able to
interpret from a higher

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
perspective from a more
evolved place in his mind,

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.180 align:middle line:84%
much like from the
highest mountain top.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first
started channeling,

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the process of shifting into
the altered state took a little

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:90%
longer than it does now.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:84%
My breathing changed,
taking in more oxygen

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
to support Bashar's
higher energy.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I would also experience
a spectrum of emotions

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
as I slipped into
the channeling state,

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:84%
as my energy rose in frequency
on its way to synchronizing

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:90%
with Bashar's vibration.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Flashes of anger,
fear, and sadness

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
gave way to hope, happiness,
and love at which point,

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
our individual vibrations
would harmonize.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a period
of a few years

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:84%
where I stopped channeling
to pursue my film career.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I resumed
doing sessions,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I was nearly overwhelmed by
the emotional reconnection

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:90%
to Bashar's energy.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.876 align:middle line:84%
And a wave of compassion
washed over me.

00:27:00.876 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was coming home.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Most of the experience is like
being in a very dynamic, very

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:90%
energetic daydream.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I don't
really hear the words.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that if someone
is really deeply in a daydream,

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and somebody calls their name,
and it takes them five times

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:90%
to hear, it's like that.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:10%
I know there's an
interaction going on,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:10%
but it might as well be
taking place in another room,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:10%
in another house,
somewhere else.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
getting translated

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:90%
for someone through language.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm acting as a
biological translator.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.750 align:middle line:84%
My energy is taking on
the personality of Bashar.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:10%
It's not like he's in me.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no possession
in that sense.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm locking with his
frequency like a tuning fork.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And by matching
his frequency, you

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.933 align:middle line:84%
get a model, a representation,
a symbol of his personality.

00:27:54.933 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Because he's not
speaking English.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.933 align:middle line:84%
He's not speaking
any language at all.

00:27:57.933 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:90%
He's just sending thoughts.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But because I'm operating
on the same wavelength

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:84%
as I've been trained to do,
I'm having the same thoughts

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.350 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm able in our
culture to translate

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:90%
his ideas into our language.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.527 align:middle line:84%
I'm focused on these pictures,
these energy patterns.

00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:84%
When he's talking to someone, I
see all the different patterns

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that represent who they
are, what their beliefs are,

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
what their hopes are,
their dreams are.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's tapping into all
sorts of different sources

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:84%
He's tapping into their higher
mind into their memories.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.270 align:middle line:84%
He's tapping into higher
source, other beings

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:90%
from his world, other worlds.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
He's tapping into whatever he
needs to, like a switchboard,

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
to bring the information through
that answers the questions

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're asking.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly feeling
all these different energy

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:84%
webs and lines of
information coming

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and going, like some sort of a
galactic train station, almost.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And it just all
coalesces, this telepathic

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
hit, but is
sometimes represented

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
by symbols, by abstract shapes,
sometimes by literal images.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's just coming
so fast and furious.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And time is so
collapsed for me that I

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
can't do nothing but just
let it through and just watch

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:90%
the show.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.815 align:middle line:10%
And these things
just flow dynamically

00:29:16.815 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:10%
through me in such a way
that I can't pay attention

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:10%
to anything else.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm left a little
disoriented at the moment.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I have to wake up from
the dream and remember who I am

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:90%
and where I am.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But once I'm back,
I'm very energized.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.782 align:middle line:90%
It's very supportive energy.

00:29:30.782 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, it
tired me out a little bit,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:90%
because there was unfamiliarity.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:84%
There was resistance
to the energy.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
how to handle it.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I often say it's like
trying to shove Hoover

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Dam through a garden hose.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But once I let go, I
relaxed, I trusted him.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I stretched that way,
those energy paths out.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.027 align:middle line:90%
Then it became very uplifting.

00:29:54.027 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It became very supportive.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, when I come out of
it, I may not remember it.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It may fade like a dream.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But I retain the concepts
I need to retain for me.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.720 align:middle line:90%
It works for me as well.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I can apply them in my life.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really
remember the conversation.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear it.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember some of
the images that I had.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm left with this
feeling of balance,

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
this feeling that
everything is OK,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
this feeling of possibility,
infinite probability.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:90%
And I just feel good.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
people will be coming

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:84%
to these sessions
for years and years

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and that develop a dialogue
and a relationship with Bashar.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But they've never actually
introduced themselves to me,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:90%
until one day they'll come up.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And they'll start
talking to me like I'm

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:90%
supposed to know who they are.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.305 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I'm sorry.

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I have no clue who you are.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's that sort of thing.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar-- by the way,
who gave you that name?

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I took a channeling class not
because I thought I was going

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:90%
to be a channel.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing
research into channeling,

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
but it was a series
of guided meditations.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the meditations,
the word Bashar was there.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, I thought it was his name.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:84%
He explained later that in their
society, they're telepathic.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
They don't need names.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
He knew we needed to
call him something.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And so that word was there.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I have since
understood that part

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of the reason that
word was chosen

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
is because part--
it's an Arabic word.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't speak Arabic, but part
of my background is Arabic.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And the word, even
though it's not his name,

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:84%
is representative
of what he does.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I was actually told
a couple of years

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.300 align:middle line:84%
after I started channeling that
the word Bashar means messenger

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.250 align:middle line:90%
or bringer of good news.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Many of you recognize
that there may

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:84%
seem to be from one perspective
an acceleration of negativity,

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
an acceleration of
violence, but really this

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is because you're at the end
of the cycle of limitation.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get it all out
on the table and deal with it

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.377 align:middle line:84%
Because there isn't
that much time

00:31:48.377 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:90%
left to deal with these things.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:10%
You have to get all
of the negativity

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.188 align:middle line:10%
out on the table in
front of your face

00:31:53.188 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:10%
so that you can consciously
decide what kind of a world

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.053 align:middle line:10%
you really prefer to have.

00:31:57.053 --> 00:31:59.470 align:middle line:10%
So now that you know you're
strong enough to deal with it,

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:10%
you're getting it all out of
your system as fast as you can,

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:10%
having the most extreme
examples come up,

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:10%
because you are strong
enough to deal with it.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:10%
So we call this the
rubber band analogy.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:10%
Fret not.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:10%
Despair not that
you have experienced

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:10%
that degree of darkness,
that degree of limitation,

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.610 align:middle line:10%
that degree of negativity.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Because the farther back into
darkness you pull the rubber

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
band, when you
finally let go, it's

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:84%
going to fly that much
faster and that much farther

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:90%
into the light.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
many scientists are

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.790 align:middle line:84%
skeptical of reports
of encounters

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.060 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials is
that many of the witnesses

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:90%
describe them as being humanoid.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:84%
The skeptics explain that in
a universe as vast as our own

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
with so many planets unlike the
Earth, the odds of alien life

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:84%
resembling us are
incredibly small.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And in general,
they're probably right.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Bashar himself has said
that most of the life

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that he's encountered
throughout the galaxy--

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:90%
they look nothing like us.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I think the irony is
that the skeptics have

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
had the answer all along, but
they've missed a vital clue.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It's probably true
that most alien life

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't look like us.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if the reports
of extraterrestrial humanoids

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.860 align:middle line:84%
are factual, it may be
that these beings are not

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:90%
really alien.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Assuming for the moment
that Bashar is real, who is he?

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Where does he come from?

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Why is he making
contact with Earth?

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of my people
began in a parallel reality

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:84%
on an alternate
version of Earth.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
The humans on that Earth
were technologically far

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:84%
in advance of the humans
in your civilization.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
However, they became focused
on technology and intellect.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Over generations, they lost
connection to their humanity.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.860 align:middle line:90%
They lost the ability to feel.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They even lost the
ability to reproduce.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They engineered love
out of their lives.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They accomplished great
technological and intellectual

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.780 align:middle line:84%
feats at the expense
of their emotions,

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
their physical bodies, and
their spiritual qualities,

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:84%
which they considered
to be inferior.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, they slowly
destroyed their environment.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.960 align:middle line:84%
In a last desperate attempt
to perpetuate their species,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
they moved underground and
began to clone themselves,

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.389 align:middle line:84%
but discovered that their
DNA was no longer viable.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
When the attempt to
clone themselves failed,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:84%
they genetically
mutated themselves

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.409 align:middle line:84%
into the beings you know
as the greys in an attempt

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to their dying planet.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:56.020 align:middle line:84%
However, they realized
that the only solution

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:84%
would be to find a viable
source of human DNA

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and introduce it back
into their genetic makeup.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.500 align:middle line:10%
They used their
advanced technology

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:10%
to shift into
parallel realities,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:10%
such as your own, where they
knew that humans must still

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:10%
exist.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But without emotions,
they had no understanding

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:84%
of the fearful impact
they would have

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
as they abducted your people
and extracted DNA in order

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to create our hybrid
civilizations,

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:84%
which took centuries
to complete.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:39.040 align:middle line:84%
We were designed to bring
emotionality and spirituality,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.350 align:middle line:84%
vitality and balance back
into the greys' civilization

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect more
fully with creation,

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:84%
so their culture
would never die out.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Although many of your people
experience these encounters

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
with the greys
traumatically at first,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.830 align:middle line:84%
we are grateful that
you chose to help bring

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:90%
our civilization into being.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
In our appreciation, we share
our knowledge and experience

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.840 align:middle line:84%
with you, with the vision
that your world will choose

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.020 align:middle line:84%
a more positive
outcome then the greys,

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
for we perceive that you
have been traveling down

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:90%
a similar path.

destruction of their parallel

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Earth gave rise to the
beings we call the greys,

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:84%
can we use that knowledge
to change our path?

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Or will we ultimately choose
to suffer the same fate?

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We must all answer this
question for ourselves.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:10%

was being created,

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:10%

reality.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And with the help of
their advanced technology,

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:84%
they transformed it
into our home world

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that became Essassani.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We have many forms
of animal life.

Along with us,
plants and animals

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
were brought to our world
from many different worlds

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:38.600 align:middle line:84%
throughout the galaxy in order
to create a balanced system

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:90%
in which we could reside.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.817 align:middle line:84%
Some of these forms of life
even came from your own world.

Our spaceships are our cities.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists
still believe there

is no way an ET
could get to Earth

that outdated concept,

is no longer as far
fetched as it used to be.

Scientists like physicist Miguel
Alcubierre and NASA engineer

Harold "Sonny" White have
developed a model for a "Star

than the thousands of years

>> In one dream, I experienced
myself being on the ship that I

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
saw with Bashar standing
there looking at me.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
look around the ship.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was all this--

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- frosted
crystalline-type material.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw another member of his
species sitting at a control

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:84%
console, but I didn't
see any controls.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And he telepathically
explained to me in the dream

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.880 align:middle line:84%
that their ships are actually
artificially intelligent.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they're actually
a representation of their own

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:84%
higher minds, and that the
pilot is actually telepathically

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.840 align:middle line:90%
linked with the ship.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:90%
They communicate.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so only the pilot
can see the controls,

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:84%
which struck me as really
cool and really efficient.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Because no one else can
fly that ship but the pilot

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.260 align:middle line:90%
that's connected to the ship.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Even though you are under
yourself a beautiful oasis

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in the sea of stars
that is your galaxy,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:84%
you are not as isolated
as you may think.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Traveling to your world
is not so difficult.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We can travel more
slowly, if we wish,

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:84%
through the manipulation of
electromagnetic and gravitic

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea, however, of going
from star system to star system

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:90%
happens in a very different way.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:30.530 align:middle line:84%
While you think of an object as
existing in a location, to us

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:84%
location is one of the
properties of the object.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
If you, thus, then have
an object at point A

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and you are able to isolate
it with an energy bubble,

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:45.110 align:middle line:84%
in a sense unlock it from
any particular reality,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and thus, then impose upon
it the vibrational signature

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.350 align:middle line:84%
frequency of location B, it
must stop existing at location A

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and instantaneously start taking
up residence at location B

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.610 align:middle line:84%
without actually having traveled
the intervening distance.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You have actually changed
its locational variable

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.035 align:middle line:90%
in its energy signature.

00:42:06.035 --> 00:42:09.296 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:09.296 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is an
accurate description,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.590 align:middle line:84%
then an extraterrestrial
civilization with this

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:26.370 align:middle line:84%
technology would be capable
of traveling light years

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.250 align:middle line:90%
in the blink of an eye.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the distances
between the stars

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.620 align:middle line:84%
would no longer be a barrier to
interaction with other worlds

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.420 align:middle line:90%
such as Earth.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:43.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.470 align:middle line:84%
To some degree, we have
addressed the first two

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:middle line:90%
questions about Bashar--

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.790 align:middle line:84%
who he is and where
he comes from.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But the answer to
the third question--

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.080 align:middle line:90%
why is he here?

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:84%
could herald one of the greatest
events in human history--

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:02.871 align:middle line:84%
open contact with a
civilization from another world.

00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I just hope
to God they're friendly.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.746 align:middle line:84%
And I hope we could
communicate and become friends.

00:43:09.746 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd say, hey, welcome.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I figure that if they have
the wherewithal to get here,

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:84%
they probably dropped
their craziness behind.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, that's a natural law.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:24.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can escape the planets
or go to other planets,

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.640 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be
kind, and loving,

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.290 align:middle line:90%
and have something to offer.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The opportunity to share
the perspective and to witness

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the being of somebody who had
been anywhere other than here

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.740 align:middle line:90%
would be fascinating.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It would just keep me
interested in what humans are.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
we can look at how

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:84%
we are in the context
of the life around us,

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:84%
the more we
understand ourselves.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So by looking at life
on another planet,

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I think we could just learn
a lot about what life is.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:11.140 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We do not mean this in a
judgemental or negative way.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.220 align:middle line:84%
We are to some degree
joking a little bit.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But why would we want to land
in an insane asylum where

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.435 align:middle line:90%
all the inmates have guns?

00:44:22.435 --> 00:44:23.716 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:23.716 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:10%
There have been
occasions when people

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.670 align:middle line:10%
in your society in these
interactions have said, Bashar,

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:10%
I know I'm ready.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to meet
you today, right now.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, all right.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:84%
There have been a few
occasions where we have

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.953 align:middle line:90%
agreed to see if that's so.

00:44:44.953 --> 00:44:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And we have named the place.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have named the time
that our ship will land.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And those people
have been there.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And as soon, in
all occasions, they

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:84%
see or sense that our
ship is approaching,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:03.110 align:middle line:84%
that our energy is growing,
they run in great fear.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people wonder.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they land?

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they just
reveal themselves?

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bashar has explained
that a lot of civilizations

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that are more advanced,
more integrated than ours

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
operate on a very high
frequency level of energy.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And because we tend to
compartmentalize things

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness, because we
give into negative definitions,

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.250 align:middle line:84%
fear-based
definitions, our energy

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is erratic, random, and of a
lower frequency, more often

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.900 align:middle line:90%
than not.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's likened
the idea to gears.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So a higher frequency
race will operate

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.910 align:middle line:90%
like a fast spinning gear.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And a lower frequency
civilization

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:84%
will be like a very
slowly turning gear.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you jam those two
gears together too quickly,

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:90%
you'll strip the gears.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.763 align:middle line:84%
They have to be more
synchronized before you

00:45:52.763 --> 00:45:53.680 align:middle line:90%
can put them together.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:10%
So basically, the way Bashar
showed me this is in a dream,

00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.430 align:middle line:10%
I saw his ship land.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And I saw him get out.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And i saw him walk toward me.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And as soon as he got--

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe
10, 20 feet away,

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I actually suddenly
lost my identity.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And I saw my body
through his eyes

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:84%
as if I became it, as if
I was absorbed by him.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And he said, see?

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.240 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like our energy is
so much more overwhelming

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:84%
at this high
frequency than yours

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is, that it can
actually overpower

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.500 align:middle line:90%
your sense of identity.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not fully integrated
enough to hold your own.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So we are delivering
information to you in the way

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that we are so that you
absorb it at your own rate.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:41.640 align:middle line:84%
You change at your own rate
when you're ready to integrate.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.400 align:middle line:84%
You upgrade your frequency
when you're ready.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you upgrade
your frequency enough,

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.730 align:middle line:84%
when you meet us halfway,
then our energies

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.380 align:middle line:84%
will be harmonized
and synchronized.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And you won't experience
this loss of identity

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:10%
or give your power over to us.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.270 align:middle line:84%
If we do it too soon,
too prematurely,

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.330 align:middle line:84%
we're not really
doing you any favors.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We'll actually be
very disruptive

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to not only your society,
but to you as an individual.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.008 align:middle line:84%
So the more you change,
the more you grow,

00:47:11.008 --> 00:47:12.550 align:middle line:84%
the more you become
more of yourself,

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:14.610 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll be like
us, the more compatible

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.170 align:middle line:84%
we'll be vibrationally,
and the more we

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.610 align:middle line:90%
can interact physically.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
contact will occur.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.430 align:middle line:84%
This for us is
how contact begins

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:31.930 align:middle line:84%
by the dissemination of ideas,
reflections, and information

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that give you the opportunity
to absorb them at your own pace,

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.940 align:middle line:84%
in your own timing, at
your own discretion,

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.780 align:middle line:90%
for we force no ideas upon you.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> If the messages delivered by
Bashar are intended to expand

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.870 align:middle line:84%
our awareness and prepare
us for physical contact,

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
what kind of information
do the messages contain?

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand
Bashar's messages,

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:84%
it's important to upgrade
old and outdated definitions

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.150 align:middle line:84%
into ones that are more
relevant for the 21st century.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Many of Bashar's
concepts require

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.380 align:middle line:90%
us to expand our awareness.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:84%
If we can perceive
reality in the same way

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that ETs experience it,
we create common ground.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And it brings us one step
closer to physical contact.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:24.350 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
The foundational
information is what

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:32.300 align:middle line:84%
we have referred to as
the five laws of creation.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.830 align:middle line:90%
The five laws are you exist.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:10%
Number two-- everything
is here and now.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Number three-- the one is the
all, and the all are the one.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Number four-- what you put
out is what you get back.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And number 5--
everything changes,

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.680 align:middle line:90%
except the first four laws.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They're not the laws of
physics which can change

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.140 align:middle line:90%
from dimension to dimension.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.590 align:middle line:84%
These are the laws of
existence, the very definition

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:07.100 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of existence,
which is true for everyone

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:12.170 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in every reality at
every time throughout creation.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:90%
They never change.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Every experience any of you
have ever had, are having now,

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:22.610 align:middle line:84%
or will ever have is some
combination of those five laws.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand with
clarity that foundation,

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.710 align:middle line:84%
you will understand exactly
how existence works.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.620 align:middle line:84%
You will understand
exactly how to create

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:90%
the realities that you prefer.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.980 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Physical reality is a reflection
of your state of being,

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.790 align:middle line:90%
your state of consciousness.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:53.400 align:middle line:84%
There really is
nothing outside of you.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.440 align:middle line:84%
You're not really
in physical reality.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Physical reality is within you.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:02.960 align:middle line:90%
It's within your consciousness.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It is a concept that you
are experiencing of yourself

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.680 align:middle line:90%
from a certain perspective.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:84%
However, we understand that the
way in which you have chosen

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to experience your
particular dimension

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of physical experience
is as though you

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:27.290 align:middle line:84%
are within a realm of space
and time as you call it,

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.710 align:middle line:84%
where you have taken your
energy, the high frequency

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:84%
energy of your spirit nature
and in a sense have lowered

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that frequency, crystallized
that frequency down into what

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
you call the experience
of physical reality.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to
remember in order

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to give yourself
more opportunity

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to choose and experience
the kind of physical reality

00:50:53.720 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:84%
you prefer is to begin to see
and experience physical reality

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:84%
as a reflection, similar to
the idea of the reflection that

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.490 align:middle line:90%
exists in your glass mirrors.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
You know that when you look
at your reflection in a glass

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:84%
mirror, you know that you're
not really over there.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And you know that if
you want to change

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the reflection in
the glass mirror,

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.270 align:middle line:84%
you don't go to the reflection
and attempt to make it change.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.130 align:middle line:84%
You must change
yourself in order

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.710 align:middle line:84%
to see the change
in the reflection.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So physical reality
being a reflection

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:36.060 align:middle line:84%
operates in much the
same kind of modality.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Any change you wish to see
in the so-called reflection,

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:42.840 align:middle line:84%
the outer reality,
must begin within,

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.510 align:middle line:84%
must begin within the
inner reality, which is you

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.030 align:middle line:84%
within your consciousness,
within your vibration,

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:90%
within your state of being.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It is all based
on state of being.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.143 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in physical
reality that is not.

00:51:57.143 --> 00:51:58.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
that there might

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.460 align:middle line:84%
be a physicalized component
or a physicalized reflection

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that you call chemistry,
or physics, or medicine,

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:90%
or science.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Those are still just
reflections of what you already

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:84%
believe in your consciousness
to be true for you.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's all based on belief.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on consciousness.

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on vibration.

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on resonance it's
all based on state of being.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why we say
circumstances do not matter,

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.680 align:middle line:90%
only state of being does.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it's state of being
that creates circumstances.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Circumstances don't
create state of being.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the other way around.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.280 align:middle line:84%
You never leave heaven
if you want a metaphor.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.570 align:middle line:10%
You never ever, ever
leave that state.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.060 align:middle line:10%
That's your natural state.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:55.680 align:middle line:10%
You are all only dreaming
that you've left,

00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.420 align:middle line:10%
but you're still there,
having this dream there.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.620 align:middle line:10%
You understand?

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:10%
You've all gone
to sleep in heaven

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.310 align:middle line:10%
and are dreaming you're in hell.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.634 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:09.634 --> 00:53:11.125 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:11.125 --> 00:53:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We are sometimes asked why
people choose to incarnate

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.030 align:middle line:90%
in physical reality on Earth.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are as many
reasons as there are people.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking, it's
an exciting place to be,

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:36.060 align:middle line:84%
especially now in this
age of transformation.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Many people want to
experience the idea

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:90%
of change and discovery.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember that in
a timeless state,

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:90%
you cannot experience change.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You cannot experience
discovery of new perspectives.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So by forgetting, in essence,
who you are as a spirit,

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.610 align:middle line:84%
as a greater being,
you can learn

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.970 align:middle line:84%
through a process of
physical space-time reality

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:04.240 align:middle line:84%
how to rediscover yourself anew
from a different perspective.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you create the idea
of the space-time framework,

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.200 align:middle line:84%
you give yourself an
opportunity to experience

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.555 align:middle line:90%
the process of creation.

00:54:12.555 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Time is, in a
sense, an illusion,

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.300 align:middle line:84%
even though the experience
of time is real.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is
that time is a side

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:32.170 align:middle line:84%
effect of your
consciousness shifting

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:36.550 align:middle line:84%
through billions of parallel
realities per second.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Parallel realities are
like frozen snapshots,

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.250 align:middle line:90%
like frames of film.

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:46.500 align:middle line:84%
They have no movement
in and of themselves.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And like your film, the only way
to create the illusion of time

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and movement is
to project a light

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.820 align:middle line:84%
through the different
frames onto a screen one

00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:01.770 align:middle line:84%
after the other in such a manner
as to create that illusion.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:05.072 align:middle line:84%
Because no frame has
movement in and of itself.

00:55:05.072 --> 00:55:07.530 align:middle line:84%
If you weren't shifting through
parallel realities billions

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of times a second, you would
have absolutely no experience

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.100 align:middle line:90%
of change whatsoever.

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything would be a frozen
snapshot like this, or perhaps

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:23.510 align:middle line:90%
like this, or maybe like this.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But you have to-- like
frames on a film strip,

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:84%
actually project
your consciousness

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
like the light of the projector
through a multitude of frames

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.200 align:middle line:84%
per second in order
to actually experience

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.920 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of any
particular time stream.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.570 align:middle line:90%
This is how reality works.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so as you shift
your consciousness

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.400 align:middle line:84%
like the projector beam
through those different frames

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of parallel realities, you
are creating this experience

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.480 align:middle line:90%
of change, and time, and space.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that all those
frames exist all at once,

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.910 align:middle line:84%
just like the projectionist
can take a strip of film,

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and stretch it out, and
look at all the frames

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:03.117 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, and look
at them in any order.

00:56:03.117 --> 00:56:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The only reason that the
projectionist can do that

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.130 align:middle line:84%
is because all the frames
exist now, simultaneously,

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:10.990 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The idea that they
come one after another

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:84%
is simply your
projection, your illusion.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the true
structure of existence

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is that everything
exists all at once.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:10%
To use your television
analogy, you

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.100 align:middle line:10%
know that if you are watching
a program on one channel,

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:10%
there are still hundreds
of other programs

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.380 align:middle line:10%
that exist at the same time,
but you only perceive the one

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.030 align:middle line:10%
that you are tuned to.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that if you
wish to experience change,

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:45.870 align:middle line:84%
if you wish to experience a
different kind of reality,

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.420 align:middle line:84%
a different way of experiencing
space and time, all

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you need to do is shift to a
different parallel reality that

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:56.100 align:middle line:84%
already exists
simultaneously with yours,

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.740 align:middle line:84%
just like changing the
channel on your television

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:02.082 align:middle line:84%
to see a different program
that exists at the same time

00:57:02.082 --> 00:57:04.290 align:middle line:84%
as the one you were just
watching that is still going

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.290 align:middle line:84%
on, even though you
have changed the channel

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and can no longer perceive it.

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.880 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> A set of
principles is a start.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But can we apply
these principles

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.680 align:middle line:84%
as tools to change our
lives and our society

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:90%
in positive and practical ways?

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:25.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Every single one of you talks
about the idea of applying some

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.820 align:middle line:10%
sort of tool or technique to
make changes in your lives

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.888 align:middle line:10%
in a positive and
constructive way.

00:57:30.888 --> 00:57:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have had many
discussions with many of you

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:36.260 align:middle line:84%
about the idea of exactly
what sort of tools to apply,

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and how to apply them,
and how to get a result,

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and how to get a manifestation.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
first and foremost,

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.570 align:middle line:84%
you are always
manifesting something.

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:49.160 align:middle line:84%
If you were not,
you wouldn't have

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.680 align:middle line:84%
an experiential physical
reality, correct?

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is you do not
have to learn how to manifest.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.570 align:middle line:90%
This is automatic.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It is built into
you as a creator,

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.860 align:middle line:90%
as an aspect of creation.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.080 align:middle line:84%
What you are simply
learning is how

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:84%
to manifest more consciously,
to be more aware of how

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.250 align:middle line:84%
you manifest so that you can
manifest what you prefer,

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.980 align:middle line:84%
instead of manifesting
your unconscious beliefs.

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:22.190 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Passion and all of
its expressions--

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:28.190 align:middle line:84%
excitement, happiness,
joy, creativity,

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:32.650 align:middle line:84%
love are all different
ways of expressing

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:36.160 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of your
true, natural self, what we

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.790 align:middle line:90%
call your signature frequency.

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:48.100 align:middle line:10%
Your signature frequency is that
resonant energy, that vibration

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.150 align:middle line:10%
that is unique to you,
that identifies you

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.790 align:middle line:10%
as a unique aspect of
all that is of creation.

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.330 align:middle line:10%


00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:02.470 align:middle line:10%
And the way you apply
that signature frequency

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:06.610 align:middle line:10%
through passion is to
act on your highest

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:11.180 align:middle line:10%
excitement to the best of your
ability with no insistence

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.090 align:middle line:10%
or assumption as to what
the outcome ought to be,

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:19.190 align:middle line:10%
as to what to come to fruition,
but to allow the synchronicity

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:23.570 align:middle line:10%
in your life to present to
you the opportunities that

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.840 align:middle line:10%
contain that excitement,
so you can recognize it.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Because excitement
is the compass needle

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.740 align:middle line:10%
that points to your
magnetic north.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:39.730 align:middle line:10%
And by acting on it to
the best of your ability,

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:44.230 align:middle line:10%
you will bring
about in your life

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:47.230 align:middle line:10%
what we call the complete kit.

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You will allow it
to work for you.

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And you will discover
very readily,

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:58.830 align:middle line:84%
very easily that excitement
can function in your life

00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:04.830 align:middle line:84%
as the driving engine, as
the organizing principle,

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:09.860 align:middle line:84%
as the path of least
resistance, as the thread that

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.430 align:middle line:84%
leads to all other
expressions of excitement,

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and as the reflective mirror
that will reveal to you what

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.170 align:middle line:84%
may be within you that is out of
alignment with that excitement,

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
so you can identify it and
bring it back into alignment

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and expand your
excitement in that way.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.990 align:middle line:10%
And simply by
following that formula

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:36.390 align:middle line:10%
of acting at every moment
to the best of your ability

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:39.990 align:middle line:10%
on your highest excitement
with no insistence on how

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:42.540 align:middle line:10%
the outcome should
look, you will

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.120 align:middle line:10%
activate that complete kit.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.730 align:middle line:10%
And it will work for
you automatically,

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:52.540 align:middle line:10%
effortlessly, every
moment without fail.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:58.620 align:middle line:10%
As you allow yourself to
move forward in that way,

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:02.490 align:middle line:10%
your life will become
an ecstatic explosion

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.080 align:middle line:10%
of synchronicity.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.050 align:middle line:10%
Very magical things
will begin to happen all

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:10.730 align:middle line:10%
around you, because
magic is, again,

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.690 align:middle line:10%
the true nature of existence.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Miracles are the natural order
of things, not the exception.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:22.500 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember, no situation
has built-in meaning.

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
fundamentally neutral.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Life is meaningless.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that's
designed to give life meaning.

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.420 align:middle line:84%
If you give situations
a positive meaning,

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
you will get a beneficial
positive effect.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
If you give them a
negative definition,

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
you can only get an effect
that is representative

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of negativity, such as
struggle, strife, difficulty,

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.538 align:middle line:90%
and obstacle.

01:01:49.538 --> 01:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You'll only see it that
way, because you're

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:52.620 align:middle line:90%
defining it that way.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Change your definition.

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll experience things
in a very different way.

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is
what you get back.

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:04.770 align:middle line:90%


01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:07.740 align:middle line:10%
Creating definitions
that work for you--

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.430 align:middle line:10%
when you look at the idea of
what you call great darkness,

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.200 align:middle line:10%
great negativity--

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.100 align:middle line:10%
let's see.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's use the imagination.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's use the inspiration.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
How can I define my
relationship to this idea

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
in a way that serves me
in a positive context?

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.910 align:middle line:90%


01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
There's always that wonderful
rubber band analogy.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
The darker you've experienced
the darkness, when you finally

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:40.230 align:middle line:84%
let go, that much farther
and faster will you

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:43.880 align:middle line:90%
fly into the light.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
That's how to look at the
idea of that experience

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:48.610 align:middle line:90%
of negativity in a positive way.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:52.890 align:middle line:90%


01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Abundance-- the ability
to do what you need

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.630 align:middle line:90%
to do when you need to do it.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
No matter in what form
the abundance comes,

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
the abundance will
give you the ability

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to do what you need to do
when you need to do it.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Not what you want to
do, what you need to do.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.210 align:middle line:90%


01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Consider these statements--

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I lack trust.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I lack abundance.

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:23.120 align:middle line:90%
I lack confidence.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no such
thing as a lack of trust.

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
as a lack of confidence.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
as a lack of abundance.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
There is, however, a
100% trust in lack.

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
There is, however, 100%
confidence in lack.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
There is, however,
complete abundance of lack.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
The idea, therefore, is that
you are always abundant.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.430 align:middle line:90%
You are always trusting.

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You are always confident
about something.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
It's about learning to be
abundant in what you prefer

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to be, learning to be confident
about what you prefer to be,

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
learning to trust what
you prefer to trust.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:13.330 align:middle line:90%


01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It is now all the rage on your
planet-- the law of attraction.

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And while it is true
in a sense that, yes,

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
you cannot experience something
that you are not the vibration

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
of and that you really do need
to operate on a frequency that

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
is representative of what
it is you wish to attract,

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a little bit of a
misunderstanding in exactly how

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
this so-called law of
attraction actually works.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's giving you
the impression in the way that

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
you've been framing it, that you
have to learn not to generate

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
that frequency and you don't.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.990 align:middle line:84%
You already generate
the perfect frequency

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
to attract everything that is
truly necessary in your life.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of you, because,
again, of the way

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
you've been taught
to define things

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
in your physical
reality, have this--

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
a picture in your head that when
you vibrate in a certain way,

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:11.740 align:middle line:84%
you are attracting something
from somewhere else to here.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And that when you
release something else,

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you are releasing
it, so to speak,

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:19.390 align:middle line:90%
from here to somewhere else.

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, many of you
now understand that everything

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.160 align:middle line:90%
exists right here and now.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not really coming
from anywhere else

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:29.590 align:middle line:90%
or going to anywhere else.

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It is, in a sense,
simply being rearranged

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
as a ratio of energy,
as a balance of energy,

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
as an equation of energy within
the consciousness that you are.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So the way that this law of
attraction and manifestation

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
actually works is to
recognize that you are already

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
giving off, already radiating
a core signature vibration.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And that core
signature vibration

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
is already doing
everything it can possibly

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
do to attract everything
that is representative

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.980 align:middle line:90%
of that particular frequency.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
If the things that
are representative

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of that particular frequency are
not manifesting in your life,

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
it's not because you're
not attracting them.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It's because your beliefs
are keeping them at bay.

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that you have
to learn to attract them.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
It's that you have to learn
to let go of vibrations that

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.470 align:middle line:84%
are not compatible with your
core frequency that are keeping

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
those things from
getting to you,

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
from manifesting
in your reality.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And conversely,
all the things that

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
are not compatible with
your core vibration

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
are doing their best to
get as far away from you

01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:42.860 align:middle line:90%
as they possibly can.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
they may not be is

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
because you're holding on to
them and not letting them go.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So the law of
attraction is really not

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
necessarily about having to
learn to attract something.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction is
really all about letting go

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.492 align:middle line:90%
and letting in.

01:07:03.492 --> 01:07:04.700 align:middle line:90%
That's really all it's about.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's about being yourself,
living in the moment,

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
being your true vibration,
and then allowing

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
the things that
are representative

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
of that vibration to manifest
in your life physically.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>> The excitement that Bashar
generates when he comes through

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:22.100 align:middle line:10%
and captivates an audience
is most heartwarming.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.380 align:middle line:10%
His impeccable timing
and his ability

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.330 align:middle line:10%
to get to the root of
a questioner's issue

01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:28.790 align:middle line:10%
is quite extraordinary.

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Time after time,
I see people have

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
profound life-changing
experiences as they

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
hear Bashar explain that
it's OK to be your true self

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.540 align:middle line:90%
and to act on your passion.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.240 align:middle line:10%
It's really fascinating to
see all the positive ways

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.030 align:middle line:10%
that Bashar's messages have
impacted people's lives.

01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the results of acting
on your passion is an increase

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in positive synchronicity where
everything happens in perfect

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
timing.

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I got into the film industry,
specifically because I

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
wanted to work in miniature
effects for sci-fi films,

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.500 align:middle line:90%
for action films.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
This was very exciting to me

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And I went around
knocking on doors,

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't really
find an opening.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:07.440 align:middle line:10%
Just about that time,
"Star Wars" came out.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And I went to see it.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And it completely blew me away,
like it did for so many people.

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that once
I saw that film,

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I really had to get
into the business.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
One day I was reading
the newspaper.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And a local theater that
was playing "Star Wars"

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
said if anyone will
come down to the theater

01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and help them handle
the tremendous lines,

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
they would hire that
person on the spot.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.917 align:middle line:84%
So I ran down to the
theater and got the job.

01:08:29.917 --> 01:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I figured if I was
an usher at the theater

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
while helping them
handle the lines,

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:36.859 align:middle line:84%
I could watch the movie as
many times as I wanted to

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and really study how
they did those effects.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.689 align:middle line:84%
One day, out of all
of the three months

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:44.359 align:middle line:84%
that I worked at this theater,
I took tickets at the door

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
for one 20-minute period.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the technicians from
"Star Wars" came to the theater

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:50.870 align:middle line:90%
to see the movie.

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.609 align:middle line:84%
I recognized him and
struck up a conversation.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:55.279 align:middle line:84%
And he was responsible
for getting

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
me an interview that
allowed me to get hired

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:01.189 align:middle line:90%
at a special effects company.

01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't acted on my passion,
I never would have met him.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I never would have
made the connection.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And I never would have gotten
into the industry that way.

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.700 align:middle line:10%
Following your excitement and
acting on your highest joy

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.160 align:middle line:10%
shows you how all things
are connected and leads you

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.399 align:middle line:10%
down the proper path to
allow synchronicity to occur

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.240 align:middle line:10%
and manifest your dreams.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It's also interesting
that following my passion

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.819 align:middle line:84%
to work in the film
business, before I even

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
knew about Bashar, has
given me the skills

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to blend filmmaking
and channeling in order

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
to present this information
in a broader way than ever

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
before Bashar says everything
is an orchestration.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.649 align:middle line:84%
So I've come to understand
that the choices I made

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:41.529 align:middle line:84%
are part of my
agreement with him

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:44.794 align:middle line:84%
and may be part of a larger
plan leading to first contact.

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:48.040 align:middle line:90%


01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people will recognize
me out in public.

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And they'll call me
Bashar instead of Darryl.

01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, but
it's also endearing.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe answering to that
name will help me become

01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
my own version of
him, which is really

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:02.710 align:middle line:90%
just another way of saying that

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm becoming more my true self.

01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel like Bashar represents
what we could all become.

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.945 align:middle line:84%
We often say we're only
human, but maybe we're not.

01:10:11.945 --> 01:10:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we don't really know what
it means to be fully human.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps Bashar is showing us
how to express our humanity more

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.400 align:middle line:90%
fully.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.160 align:middle line:10%
If we act from our
highest aspirations,

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.300 align:middle line:10%
restore what we've lost,
reconnect and work in harmony

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:34.880 align:middle line:10%
with nature, develop cleaner
ways to power our world,

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.740 align:middle line:10%
help each other to thrive, and
find our true place in life,

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.780 align:middle line:10%
we can walk a new path that
leads to a brighter future.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%


01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Contact is an ongoing
experience and part

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of the natural evolution
of you as a species

01:10:56.310 --> 01:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
from what you may loosely
call Homo sapiens to Homo

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Galacticus.

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:09.240 align:middle line:90%


01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> An alien civilization
came to visit us--

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be a pretty
big shock for the planet,

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.780 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that in order for
us to even accept that

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
into our reality, we will have
had to have gone to a place

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.850 align:middle line:84%
where crazy things happen
all the time, things

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to the point where if
an alien shows up, oh,

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
it's just part of
the new normal.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Once we acknowledge that
extraterrestrials do exist,

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.350 align:middle line:10%
that they have technology
that can get them here,

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.910 align:middle line:10%
however that may be, the idea
we have behind how we power

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.970 align:middle line:10%
our civilization through energy
and electrical power will

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.270 align:middle line:10%
drastically change.

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:53.340 align:middle line:10%
Because if we acknowledge that
their ships get here and have

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:59.370 align:middle line:10%
propulsion systems that do
not require fossil fuels,

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:02.790 align:middle line:10%
then our own ideas as what we
think we know about physics

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:03.810 align:middle line:10%
will change.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:08.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Eventually, if we receive
some visitor from another--

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.620 align:middle line:10%
galaxies come--

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.460 align:middle line:10%
look, same as human being.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.610 align:middle line:10%
Maybe little different shapes.

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:18.220 align:middle line:90%


01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.540 align:middle line:90%
But basically, the same.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:23.293 align:middle line:10%
Then furthermore,
same sentient being.

01:12:23.293 --> 01:12:26.180 align:middle line:10%
Respect them.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> 50% of Earth's population
is under 30 years old.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So humans have been in space
longer than these people

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.310 align:middle line:90%
have been alive.

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
To this generation and
all generations to come,

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.970 align:middle line:90%
space travel is a fact of life.

Over a thousand planets

have been discovered within
the last two decades.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
The probability of
discovering another world

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
capable of supporting
life as we know

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:53.450 align:middle line:90%
it is increasing every day.

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The concept of alien
contact is no longer

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.760 align:middle line:90%
foreign to our society.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The question isn't if it
will happen, but when.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:06.470 align:middle line:84%
This new collective mindset
may be all the invitation

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
society needs

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:11.600 align:middle line:90%
to initiate contact with us.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
However, devastating encounters
between European explorers

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and Native American
cultures are often

01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
used as examples of
what could happen

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to our society in the
aftermath of contact

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.770 align:middle line:90%
with a more advanced ET culture.

01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But it is precisely because they
may be more advanced than us

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that they would take steps
to make sure no harm is

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:33.712 align:middle line:90%
done to our way of life.

01:13:33.712 --> 01:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%

genetically connected to you,

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
we are family, for we are, in
that sense, your descendants.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:43.490 align:middle line:90%
And you are our ancestors.

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And thus, our deep, deep
connection to you as family

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:50.330 align:middle line:90%
is profound.

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
By interaction through open
contact, our family grows.

01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:55.950 align:middle line:90%
We expand each other.

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:57.390 align:middle line:90%
We support each other.

01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.790 align:middle line:90%
We grow together.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And together we grow into
something that neither of us

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:03.170 align:middle line:90%
individually can ever become.

and unique opportunity

01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
on your planet to recognize
that you are living side by side

with other sentient species.

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:27.100 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins are
in many ways one

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
of the most similar sentient
species to your own.

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We may be extraterrestrial,
because we

01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:35.260 align:middle line:90%
don't come from your world.

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But because we are
genetically related to you,

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.670 align:middle line:90%
we are not really alien.

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, the dolphins
are not extraterrestrial,

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
because they co-inhabit
your world with you.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.330 align:middle line:90%
They truly are alien to you.

01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Thus, by being willing
to interact with them

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and learn to
communicate with them,

01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
it will actually give
you a great opportunity

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to learn to communicate

Bashar's suggestion,

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I developed a strong passion
for swimming with wild dolphins

and whales and found that
being with them offers you

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to enter
a state of consciousness

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that's actually quite similar
to the channeling state.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
From that state, you can
access more information

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:24.000 align:middle line:10%
And he plotted the log of
the frequency of occurrence

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.120 align:middle line:10%
in rank order.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.110 align:middle line:10%
In other words, first, second,
third, fourth, and so on.

01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:31.440 align:middle line:10%
And he said the frequency of
occurrence of the letter E

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.670 align:middle line:10%
is the most.

01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll plot the frequency
of occurrence of the letter T

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
in the book and then
the letter A on down.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And he found a relationship
that was basically -1 slope.

01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:50.070 align:middle line:10%
In other words, a slope of -1
gives you a 45-degree angle.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:52.920 align:middle line:90%
And he did this for letters.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And he did it for
Chinese characters.

01:16:56.790 --> 01:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And he did it for various
phonemes, Russian phonemes.

01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:05.460 align:middle line:10%
It turns out all human
languages produce this -1 slope.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.550 align:middle line:10%
And so what we
did is we compiled

01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:09.450 align:middle line:10%
a dictionary of
bottlenose dolphins

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:11.850 align:middle line:10%
or whistle communication system.

01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:14.640 align:middle line:10%
And we plotted their
frequency of occurrence.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And we got the -1 slope
for dolphins as well.

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
was two baby dolphins

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.580 align:middle line:90%
were born at Marine World.

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And we recorded them with my
colleague, Brenda McCowan.

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
For humans, when babies
are born, they babble.

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:34.680 align:middle line:10%
And they produce
a shallow slope.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that the baby
dolphins were babbling as well.

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:41.980 align:middle line:10%
They landed right on
top of human babbling.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:46.410 align:middle line:10%
And as they grew up
after about 12 months,

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:48.350 align:middle line:10%
they had this -1 slope.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, we
determined that baby dolphins

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
are born babbling and then
learn as they grow up.

because they've never had
such things happen to them.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
it solved this problem,
it cleared this thing up,

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
it gave me a whole
new perspective,

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to feel
like I was in control,

01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to experience
the outcome that I really

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.500 align:middle line:84%
preferred to experience, I
mean, that's very gratifying.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And it tells me that this
is real on that level.

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the important
thing to understand

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
is it's not about whether people
believe that Bashar is real.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not about whether
this is another aspect

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.810 align:middle line:90%

may look from the outside.

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%

the incredible levels

of happiness, well-being,
and inspiration that you

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%

It's really enriched my life
in a lot of different ways.

So I think that anyone
who has an opportunity

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.420 align:middle line:10%
to follow a path
that's unusual--

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.180 align:middle line:10%
even if people
think you're crazy,

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:56.740 align:middle line:10%
I think the rewards outweigh
anyone else's opinion.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.030 align:middle line:10%
And you don't always know
where you're going to wind up.

That's part of the adventure.

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
So I'd say go for it.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.560 align:middle line:10%
Because the alternative
is to wonder what

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.640 align:middle line:10%
would have happened.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:14.410 align:middle line:10%

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:23.230 align:middle line:84%
with Earth through channels or
via other types of encounters,

01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:27.880 align:middle line:84%
we are nevertheless at the dawn
of a new era of exploration not

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
only of the vast outer
universe, but also of our deep,

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
inner consciousness.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
If Bashar and other
ETs are in fact real,

01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:40.250 align:middle line:90%
two questions remain.

01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:44.330 align:middle line:84%
When is open physical
contact likely to occur?

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And will we be ready
when that day comes?

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You are going to make a
discovery whereby your people

01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
will know that it is a fact that
extraterrestrial life exists

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
in some way, shape, or form.

01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But no matter what
that form may be,

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that will change
the mindset that

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
will make open contact from an
extraterrestrial civilization

01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
with your world most probable
between your years of 2025

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.670 align:middle line:90%
to 2033.

01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There have been from time
to time, certain encounters.

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Not everything that
you may see is a ship.

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:32.870 align:middle line:10%
Not every experience
that may seem to be other

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:36.680 align:middle line:10%
worldly is necessarily
representative of us

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.390 align:middle line:10%
or those like us.

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:42.290 align:middle line:84%
As far as UFO sightings
go, the primary ones

01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that you need to recognize
are the sightings

01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that you have called the Phoenix
Lights over your Arizona area.

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Similar craft were
spotted in the area

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
you call your Hudson Valley on
the East Coast of your United

01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:56.960 align:middle line:90%
States.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.620 align:middle line:10%
And waves of triangular
craft were spotted

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.230 align:middle line:10%
in the area you call Belgium.

01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
They have showed
you their craft.

01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And they have
gauged the reaction.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So far, the official
reaction has been mostly one

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.690 align:middle line:90%
of denying it ever happened.

01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:17.155 align:middle line:90%

01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
As the relationship between your
world and other worlds grows,

01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
you will venture out to
the stars yourselves.

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And you will visit other worlds.

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And you will become their UFOs.

01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:17.190 align:middle line:90%


01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It has been a misunderstanding
in certain cultures

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:23.400 align:middle line:84%
on your planet that
the idea of having

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.700 align:middle line:84%
a unified world,
a harmonious world

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
means that you all
have to be homogenized.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:33.480 align:middle line:84%
That is as far from
unity as you can get.

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
True harmony, true
unity is the product

01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:41.640 align:middle line:84%
of absolute validation of all
of the individual differences

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.870 align:middle line:90%
between you.

01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Because each of
you was made to be

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.840 align:middle line:90%
a unique piece of the puzzle.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And like a piece of
a puzzle picture,

01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
if you are the shape
you were made to be,

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
then you will fit with all
the other unique shapes

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and together form
one big picture that

01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
will support all the pieces,
even as the pieces support

01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:06.201 align:middle line:90%
the whole picture.

01:29:06.201 --> 01:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you just relax
into the true unique self

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and validate all the
differences between you fully,

01:29:16.090 --> 01:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
then you will all see that
you are like different notes

01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:20.140 align:middle line:90%
of an orchestration.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
You will all fit and
play a beautiful song

01:29:23.710 --> 01:29:26.870 align:middle line:90%
that will surround your world.

01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And in that bubble will you
find the harmony and unity

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:33.300 align:middle line:90%
that you seek.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, we've asked
the question, are we alone?

01:29:37.770 --> 01:29:40.590 align:middle line:84%
If something as impossible
as an encounter with a UFO

01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:43.170 align:middle line:84%
can happen, then I
feel the universe

01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is more mysterious
than I imagined,

01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:47.850 align:middle line:90%
that maybe anything is possible.

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that
contact isn't just

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:52.770 align:middle line:84%
about people from other worlds
coming to Earth in the future.

01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:55.140 align:middle line:90%
It's much bigger than that.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe the experience of
contact is part of evolution

01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:00.150 align:middle line:90%
itself.

01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.460 align:middle line:84%
By shifting to a higher
state of awareness

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
through channeling,
acting on my passion,

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and being open to new
definitions of reality,

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I've come to realize that
beings from the stars

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.290 align:middle line:90%
have always been here.

01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we've
never really been alone.
