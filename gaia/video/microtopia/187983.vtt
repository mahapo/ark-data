>> We need to find new
ways of living together,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and that is what I'm
looking for in my work.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I still believe bettering
the world and society through

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the economy is one
reason why people are trying

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to downsize, because
things are so expensive.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You use
already-manufactured objects,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:84%
then you bring it
into the architecture.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's like ready
made in architecture.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people just don't
like the fact that they've been

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:84%
essentially forced into larger
spaces than they actually want

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:90%
to be in.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to re-appropriate
existing things,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
make new items out
of this garbage.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no question in my
mind that something that is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
more compact is a
smarter way to build.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what we can do is we
can use all of this trash,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
which is damaging the ecology,
and turn it into something

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.302 align:middle line:90%
really beneficial.

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'm trying to
create a better world,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and in order to do that, we have
to experiment and try out other

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
ways of living.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I find it very interesting
to look at something and imagine

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.104 align:middle line:90%
what its next life would become.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Given my interest
in mobility, I've

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
always looked at
structures that are outside

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:90%
of architecture that move.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Part of my thinking has to do
with the nature of being human,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:90%
and what does that entail.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
To some degree, we have
this desire to hold memory.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And often our memories
are stored in our attics,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because they're embedded
within the objects that we own.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But now memory can just
be stored on a hard drive.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So we can dispose or do away
with the collection of stuff

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.245 align:middle line:90%
and live more lightly.

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
As humans, I really feel like we
were not meant to be sedentary.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Constantly when I
travel, I'm always

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
drawn to the people
that are building

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
with makeshift
construction pieces,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%
or using wheels in unusual ways.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I looked further
and further into that,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and found that there's
an incredible history

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
of mobile lifestyles,
and it became my passion.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Recently I took an
old truck trailer

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and craned it in over my house
and attached it to the back--

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
a structure that might
not be roadworthy anymore,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and rethought how I could skin
it, how I could create openings

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
in it, and make a contribution
to a dwelling that

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
then could also be moved
and relocated as needed.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I get really excited when
I'm driving down the freeway

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and I see a truck go by.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
start to fantasize

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
about how that could
become part of a house,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.995 align:middle line:84%
or it could become
a mobile library.

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous amount
of industrial materials

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that are out in the landscape
that can be redeployed

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.902 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of different ways.

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
shipping container

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:90%
is a terrific example.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not spending energy on
creating it from scratch,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
but I'm repurposing
it for another use.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The Joshua Tree prefab
is a modular home,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:84%
sits out on the desert floor,
and is a fully self-sufficient

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:84%
structure, where it is not
attached to the electrical grid

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and is not attached
to the water system.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It is a very simple
building that is really

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
meant to allow you to
sleep, to eat, and to relax,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that then can be moved
from location to location

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:90%
at the snap of a finger.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
there absolutely

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:84%
is a movement that is pervasive
throughout this country, where

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
people are looking
to be able to create

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
their environments without
having rules thrust upon them.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Within that thinking, there is
a difference in terms of scale.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's less about bigger
is better, and more

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:90%
about smaller is smarter.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is connected
to the dwelling

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:90%
that we have around us.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.995 align:middle line:84%
So the less stuff we have, the
lighter that the materials are,

00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
the smarter they
become, the less

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:90%
encumbered we become as people.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
The buildings that I
create are not large,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and yet they have a
sense of volume to them.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:90%
They have natural light.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They have ceilings
that tend to be higher

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
than conventional houses
so that you feel expansive

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
in terms of height, but not
necessarily in terms of width.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:84%
If you can look outside
and be connected

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to the natural
environment outside,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
you are expanding
your space visually,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:90%
but not necessarily physically.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Innately as a human being, we
are nomadic and we're mobile

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're curious, and we
will always be exploring.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's here in the
desert, or whether it's

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
out in space, or in the ocean,
we can't just let that go.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When I look at what I
consider to be beautiful

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in the world, it's
what is necessary.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
When something is truly
necessary, it becomes vital,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.455 align:middle line:84%
and it seems important,
and it seems beautiful.

00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The average American
house puts out

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
like 18 tons worth of
greenhouse gases per year,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
consumes about a quarter
acre of woodland,

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
puts another seven tons
of construction waste

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:90%
into the local landfill.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to contribute to
that as little as I had to

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.214 align:middle line:84%
and still have a
great place to live.

00:08:28.214 --> 00:08:31.553 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I never did any building
until I decided to live small.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't really afford to
have anybody else build for me.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So I built my own house, and
that's how I learned to do it,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
just by doing.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I've actually lived in four
tiny houses of about this size.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The first one was pretty
much exactly this size.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:90%
The second one--

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.662 align:middle line:84%
When I moved to California where
the land prices are expensive,

00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make sure my
house was small enough

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that I could parallel
park it by hand

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.502 align:middle line:90%
if I had to live on the street.

00:09:08.502 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Turned out I didn't have
to live on the street.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So I sold that one and
built another, larger one,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and then, finally, this one.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
The first step to designing
a very small efficient space

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
seems to be figuring out
what you actually need,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and then getting
rid of everything.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, for example, I
don't cook very much at all.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So my counter's only three
and a half feet long.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
If I cooked a lot, I might turn
the whole house into a kitchen.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's a matter
of deciding what

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
you need to do to be happy, and
then accommodating for that.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Because if you're not--

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I guess the other side of living
simply is living too simply,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, and not having what you
need, which isn't good either.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The laws in the US say you can't
build a house that's too small.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
There are a few different
rules in there that apply.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have a
room of 120 square feet.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Any bedroom has to be
at least 70 square feet.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
When you add it all up, it's
bigger than I actually wanted.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So by putting a house on wheels,
it's no longer a building,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to abide
by building codes,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can build it
as small as you want.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.652 align:middle line:84%
You just can't go too big,
because otherwise you're

00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
probably going to
hit a bridge when

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.318 align:middle line:90%
you're driving down the road.

00:10:33.318 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It is sort of a
counter-cultural thing.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
just don't like the fact

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that they've been essentially
forced into larger spaces

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
than they actually
want to be in.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So besides just being
environmental and economic,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing is also sort
of a civil disobedience act.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of getting around the
forces that have forced people

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
into more house than
they actually wanted

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:90%
or needed in the past.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.388 align:middle line:84%
I hope to build a village
within the next couple of years

00:11:18.388 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in this county so
people don't always

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
have to fight the codes
and the zoning laws.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
They can just live
in a tiny house

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
village, which will probably
be zoned as a trailer park,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:90%
oddly enough.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I've never really
thought of myself

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:84%
as a trailer park
type of person,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
but this won't be your
average trailer park.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It'll be lots of pedestrian
walkways, cars out back,

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and it will basically
be co-housing

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:90%
for the anti-social--

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.227 align:middle line:84%
like shared some things,
but lots of privacy

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:90%
in your little houses too.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I can fit a bed downstairs,
but if I put a bed downstairs,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't have--

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.012 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that takes
up a lot of space.

00:12:00.012 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:90%
So I just go up.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I like to use vertical space
as much as possible to make

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.963 align:middle line:90%
things really efficient.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
A house in which there's
a lot of wasted space

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:90%
just doesn't feel vital.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And you fill it with a bunch
of stuff you don't really need.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Life itself seems
diminished a bit.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So in a house where
everything is necessary, life

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
itself seems very necessary.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I feel very much
more alive in a small place.

>> The reason why I'm
doing this project is

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because it's something that
I believe that is really

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
necessary with the way that
civilization is growing over

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:84%
the planet, and it's
something that can really heal

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:90%
the ecology of the planet.

Coming from a town in
the north of England

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:84%
where there's quite a bit of
pollution, a lot of industry,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I was always quite interested
in ecology from an early age.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:84%
This idea came over a number
of years when I was in my 30s

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
after thinking deeply about
spiritual things, and also

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
ecological state of the planet
and what the future could

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
be, with more
people all the time

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and more trees getting
cut down, this idea

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
came to actually grow
plants and use the trash

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to create a base for a
floating garden that just keeps

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.024 align:middle line:90%

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:90%

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The way I begin to build the
island, it's just so simple.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
You take one shipping
pallet, and then

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:84%
you get the bags of bottles and
just put them on the back end

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:90%
and tie them together.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:84%
When a plastic bottle is
underneath a floating island

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in cool water where the
sun isn't getting on it,

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
it could last for
thousands of years.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know, but we
do know it last a lot longer.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I actually took a
bag out after many years

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
of-- because I've been
doing this five years.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I've checked, and corals
are growing underneath on them.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:90%
And the tops get corals.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can't even take
the tops off afterwards.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that it can get
big enough and strong enough

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to actually go on the ocean
and float down, and eventually

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.525 align:middle line:84%
go through the Panama Canal
and out onto the Pacific.

00:15:52.525 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not like a boat.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Boats are solid and
they rock like this,

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:90%
and it's a different thing.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
An island, because
it's all flexible,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:90%
the wave comes through.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:90%
So the island actually rolls.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So I say boats rock,
but islands roll.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways to
use and recycle and make

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:90%
wonderful homes.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And you put your love in
it, and the love comes back.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And other people who visit
enjoy it as well so much.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.785 align:middle line:84%

comes partially from rainfall.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It's creating more
uniqueness instead

of having the old houses
out of ticky tacky,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:90%

Variety in life, I think,
is really, really important.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that since
I kind of dropped out

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:84%
a little bit from doing
the regular job, my life--

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I can flow and feel
the spirit just taking

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:90%
me one way or the other.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And as I do what I choose to
do, my energy flows into that

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and actually produces
something more beautiful,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.324 align:middle line:90%
and there's more satisfaction.

00:17:32.324 --> 00:17:35.782 align:middle line:90%

use all of this trash, which

is damaging the ecology,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%

planet, create more oxygen,

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:84%
filter, clean the water, put
the trash underneath, and create

people to live on.

it does not correspond
to its function anymore.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So you do not have the same

So it's kind of a small
prison cell in a way.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a cell where somebody
can find himself momentarily.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We can be inside smaller spaces
without having the idea that we

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:90%
are in smaller spaces.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And because our
window is now a screen

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
that can change endlessly.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:90%

Internet poses the condition
of a new minimalism.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
This changes the architecture
of what a house is

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:90%
or what a house would be.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The space that one needs in
order to observe his screen

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is the space, a
minimum space of today.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea in concrete
beds has to do

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:84%
with the concept of
understanding the internet

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%

Cave society where
infrastructure is hidden,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
but what we need is
only a place to sleep--

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.675 align:middle line:90%
Internet and a cave.

00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
We do not go toward a
more complex civilization,

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.785 align:middle line:84%
but we go backwards
towards a cave society.

00:24:05.785 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:90%

here we're just not surrounded

by all the stuff
that's in cities.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And it just makes you
appreciate people more,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
inundated with stimuli

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.225 align:middle line:90%

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:40.875 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like my house
in upstate New York,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
my property taxes alone
were $12,000 a year.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And just to sustain all that
stuff can be really expensive.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to just figure
out what you really need

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and scale it back a little bit
it makes all the rest of life

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.099 align:middle line:90%
easier.

I worked in photography for
about six or seven years

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
in fashion photography, and then
I got kind of tired of fashion.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So I went onto set
and prop building.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I did that for about 10
years, got tired of that,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
just got tired of being around
that many people all the time.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Since I didn't have a family,
I didn't have a wife, kids,

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:84%
it was I could do
anything I wanted.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking
about how much room

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.692 align:middle line:90%
did I really need to live in.

00:25:50.692 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
strange, because I

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
lived in a 2,800
square feet, and now I

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:90%
live in 128 square feet.

When I was six or
seven years old,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I used to think I wanted to
be a hermit when I grow up.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is perfect, because
five or six days will go by

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and I won't see another
human, and I don't really

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:90%
mind that too much.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:90%

One of the other things that I
thought about quite a bit was I

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.195 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do it all myself.

00:26:40.195 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So I've done all the
construction by myself

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.618 align:middle line:84%
on my house, both my
house and the greenhouse.

a schedule out here.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:84%
There's always something
to do, and then there's

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:84%
always plenty of time
to sit back and relax.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:90%
My water collection system is--

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I've got a huge greenhouse
roof that has gutters on it.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So when it rains, it
collects in the gutters

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and it goes into
big storage tanks.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:33.800 align:middle line:90%

off-grid living a little bit

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:90%
before I left upstate New York.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a little camp
I'd set up, and I'd

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:84%
live out there
during the summers

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and rent my big
farmhouse out to folks

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
from New York City that wanted
a weekend place for the summer.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'd learned to not
really make sacrifices,

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:84%
but just learned a
different way of living

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
where you don't constantly
need electricity pouring out

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:90%
of every corner of your house.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:84%
For me it was more about
living a simple lifestyle

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and living debt-free.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.425 align:middle line:84%

being a high-tech pioneer.

that I'm disconnected.

really a hermit,

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:84%

how I couldn't go to sleep

But it wasn't
because of the noise.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:46.472 align:middle line:84%

something was going on

about the housing, what is it?

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a closet.

getting sentimental.

Because you can have everything
that you have in a house,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:90%
you can have it elsewhere.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You can eat better

that we could have.

just very emotional,
because out of that,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.280 align:middle line:84%
when you think about it,
it's just full of object

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that you bring that

But I was going
intuitively into a field

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that I carry on exploring now,
because all of those spots

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:84%

competition most of the time.

And the problem
about the competition

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:90%
is that it never asks the why.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:84%
In France, we have like a
very long tradition of strike.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It really came from the
roots of social events,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.380 align:middle line:84%
because finally people do a
lot of striking in France.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, sometimes they sit,

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and then, after, they go.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The [INAUDIBLE]
de France project

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
is a place for
them to settle down

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:00.776 align:middle line:84%
and to try to recreate
a new social scenario.

00:33:00.776 --> 00:33:03.608 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:03.608 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to create
a city within the city

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to create a pocket
of resistance that

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:90%
could grow inside the city.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:20.865 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:84%
You use already
manufactured objects,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and you bring it into
the architecture.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.625 align:middle line:84%
So it's like ready-made
in architecture.

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Prefabs you need that you
use on the construction site,

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
fast, it's very cheap,

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:90%
installations are done.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:84%
All of those elements
can come there by trucks,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and then it could really
grow into a larger pocket,

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and could grow to
something very strong.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's more about a
strategy than a form.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:90%


00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it's not
relevant so much

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
anymore to destroy the
buildings, because when you

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
destroy some stuff, you
destroy a part of a city,

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and destroy the
history of the people.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And transforming is
actually a very good way.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
The city, when you look
at it as an open ground,

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.389 align:middle line:84%
there's multiple wave on
the rooftop, on the wall,

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:84%
underneath the bridges,
in between the buildings,

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:90%
on the gaps.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:42.010 align:middle line:84%
There's always a lot of places
where a parasite architecture

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:90%
can be put on.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
So the idea about that is
more architectural hijack.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.090 align:middle line:90%
It's such a strong protest.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It's such a way to recreate a
schism, a city inside a city,

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.480 align:middle line:90%
that it could bring out--

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%
it could totally
bring out civil war.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you decide to go by will
to recreate something new, then

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:84%
for me, the violence
is getting legit.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.855 align:middle line:84%
>> So we need to find a whole
new definition of living

00:35:39.855 --> 00:35:40.655 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:35:40.655 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with tents all
my life from when I was a kid.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.190 align:middle line:84%
We had a whole competition
in the neighborhood

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:90%
in the back alleys.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The guy who had
the coolest tent,

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:90%
he had everything to say about--

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:90%
he had the power.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So originally, those
tents were meant

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to comfort the life
of tree activists.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It would give them a
more comfortable stay

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:90%
during their actions in the--

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.210 align:middle line:84%
during their occupations
of the forest

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:90%
to stay there a very long time.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Imagine this tent hanging
very high in a trunk.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:90%
You cannot cut down the trees.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Imagine we have loads of them.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:44.390 align:middle line:84%
You cannot cut down the forest,
and the activists still would

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.710 align:middle line:90%
have a comfortable stay.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It was just designed by
hanging in a circular floor

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:01.450 align:middle line:84%
with a rope against
a tree, and then you

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:90%
were walking against this rope.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So I designed a bypath
to you can still

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:90%
move around in this tent.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:90%
It's very spacious.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.210 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Four meters high,
and 260 in diameter,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:84%
the weight of the steel
frame is 300 kilos.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.870 align:middle line:90%
A tent is our common house.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not the house,
but our common house.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:90%
That's makes a difference.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.465 align:middle line:84%
A house is immediately closed
and is closing everything.

00:37:51.465 --> 00:37:52.265 align:middle line:90%
It's not inviting.

00:37:52.265 --> 00:37:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's inviting,
and it pays respect

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.260 align:middle line:90%
to the privacy of people.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Creating your own space, being
able to live wherever you want,

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:29.250 align:middle line:84%
having some kind of comfort
in the middle of nowhere,

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:84%
that is giving my
working practice

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:90%
a goal for the rest of my life.

In the city, to work with public
spaces is always a problem.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, look here, in the
middle of the nature.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just a calm and
easy project here.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
You are hanging there,
free from the ground

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and free from the trunk,
just in the space,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:90%
and the space is all around you.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:84%
That is what I experience
here very much,

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and what I am looking
for in my work--

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:84%
how we relate to each other,
how we turn around each other.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:90%


00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of life is happening
in houses, of course

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in the pubs and the
cafes, but that is still

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:90%
not only a free public space.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Find a free public
space where people

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:17.080 align:middle line:84%
from all of the city, all
layers of the society,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.960 align:middle line:84%
are able to come
together in a free way.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
That's not an easy
thing we can do.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, we
don't succeed in this.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
still a long way

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:41.070 align:middle line:84%
to go to design cities in this
way, maybe more with textile.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:90%
It would be great.

confined space for an everyday

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:16.080 align:middle line:84%

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.935 align:middle line:90%

an enclosed space where you can
hide away from the grown ups.

00:41:26.425 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm still doing that.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.002 align:middle line:84%

Steel shell system
is a very radical way

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of creating a home that you
could actually roll around

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.390 align:middle line:90%
yourself in front of you.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.922 align:middle line:84%
You could also use it as a raft

or something like that.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It was inspired-- I was
staying in Greenland,

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was studying
traditional Inuit culture.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.047 align:middle line:84%
In the wintertime they
would build igloos.

00:42:09.047 --> 00:42:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They would build
like a whole village,

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
a whole city in
hours on the snow,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:90%
sort of passages, open roads.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were live there
temporarily for three or four

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.935 align:middle line:84%
months, and then
would split up again.

00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They would do the same
thing the next winter.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was fascinated by the
mobility and the temporary sort

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of character of this
kind of dwelling system.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%

a similar system.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
way it influences

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.550 align:middle line:84%
people is that it starts
to make them think

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.870 align:middle line:90%
about their own situation.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you compare like the
average sort of middle class

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.660 align:middle line:84%
citizens in the Western
worlds' normal living

possible.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.540 align:middle line:84%
That means that we have to
get rid of land ownership.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to get rid of large bank
loans, all those things that

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:38.070 align:middle line:84%
keeps us in one position in
our life, that prevents us

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:42.510 align:middle line:84%
from using a large
amount of our time

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:45.510 align:middle line:84%
to be nice to our children,
and to be nice to other people,

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.610 align:middle line:90%
and to play with other people.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly chasing ways of
existing that would free myself

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:84%
from the normal economical
system that would keep me

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.980 align:middle line:84%
in a fixed position in order to
pay my bank loans and so forth.

My walking house is
a very peaceful way

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:21.420 align:middle line:84%
of existing, where you have
a very small footprint.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.332 align:middle line:84%
You can move around
without owning

00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:24.540 align:middle line:90%
the land and stuff like that.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
way of living.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:28.515 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
social way of existing.

00:44:28.515 --> 00:44:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's about trying to introduce
other ways of thinking

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and other ways of living, and to
start off discussions, and give

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:49.444 align:middle line:84%
people an experience
of something different.

00:44:49.444 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.485 align:middle line:84%
And I think the chance of
creating a better world,

00:45:10.485 --> 00:45:12.110 align:middle line:84%
saying I want to
create a better world,

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.506 align:middle line:84%
is much bigger than if we don't
want to create a better world.

00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I try to introduce
some kind of hope

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.400 align:middle line:90%
in thinking about our future.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The thing that would
normally always happen

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.720 align:middle line:84%
when I do something in public
space, because it's different--

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:84%
People get attracted
to it, and that's

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the starting point
of communication

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.540 align:middle line:90%
on many different levels.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.130 align:middle line:90%
People get an experience.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.360 align:middle line:90%
They feel something.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They may feel some kind of
significance in the situation,

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and you start talking together,
and you exchange experiences.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.027 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
art is all about.

00:45:51.027 --> 00:45:52.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what architecture
is all about.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what design is all about.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
could just move things

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.960 align:middle line:84%
a little bit in
another direction

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and make new things
happen, then I

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.258 align:middle line:84%
think your mission is
sort of accomplished.

00:46:06.258 --> 00:46:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, shelter is the
most basic human need.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:29.040 align:middle line:84%
A sleeping bag dress
is a kimono-type dress

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that, when inflated, it changes
into a cylinder or cocoon

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:90%
in which a person can sleep.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.600 align:middle line:84%
It comes very much from
my personal experiences.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Moving from different
countries, moving

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
through different
languages sort of

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:84%
brought up a lot of
questions about belonging.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Where is my home?

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.759 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.759 --> 00:47:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a solar panel
incorporated into it

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and a small computer fan.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So the solar panel
charges the battery,

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.892 align:middle line:84%
and computer fan operates
off the batteries.

00:47:16.892 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Experimentation
was always there--

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The idea of belonging,
the idea of shelter,

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:84%
the idea of space where
we feel comfortable.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But that mobility that
this process creates,

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I think what I was after--

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:84%
To capture this
moment in the sense

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:55.150 align:middle line:84%
in between, because
since I left Poland,

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
it's always been
being in between.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Today we are more free
in terms of moving

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.855 align:middle line:84%
through those
boundaries than before.

00:48:07.855 --> 00:48:16.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I think traveling
really is the best

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:26.620 align:middle line:84%
way of opening an
eye to differences,

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and then hopefully,
also, become more

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.370 align:middle line:90%
tolerant to the differences.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I was very much
interested in the idea

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of nomadism, which denies that
idea of homeland sort of as

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:52.810 align:middle line:90%
a place of belonging.

00:48:52.810 --> 00:49:01.470 align:middle line:90%


00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
modern nomad is

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:11.580 align:middle line:84%
a person that doesn't get stuck
in a particular structure.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.520 align:middle line:84%
With that comes a
certain open-mindedness.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:84%
To feel connected, we
don't need that much space.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's by contrast.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea of
being close to the body,

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.690 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of related,
also, to the question--

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, how much do you need?

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:56.090 align:middle line:84%
How much, also,
comfort do you need?

00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:90%


00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So you are protected,
you are kind of isolated,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.429 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, you
are part of the environment.

00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.120 align:middle line:84%
My expression presents
the idea of home

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.160 align:middle line:90%
that is basically anywhere.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Home is where you are.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:38.860 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I still share the
'60s fascination

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:49.480 align:middle line:84%
with technology, and
a belief in technology

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and in bettering the world.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the technology showed
alternative possibilities

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.600 align:middle line:90%
of living.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps people
can imagine that there

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:14.090 align:middle line:84%
are different possibilities
to what they are used to.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:22.760 align:middle line:84%
That opens this flexibility
of imagination, including

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.500 align:middle line:90%
how we perceive the world.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.650 align:middle line:90%
