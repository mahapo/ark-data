00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> A historian traveling through
Bolivia and Peru in the 16th

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:84%
century asked the natives
whether the extraordinary

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500 align:middle line:84%
temples seen there
were built by the Inca.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
They laughed at the
question, affirming

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that they were made
long before the Inca,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that they had heard
from their predecessors

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that the sacred places
appeared suddenly

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:84%
in the course of a
single night, built

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
by an ancient race of
tall superhuman people,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
long since vanished,
who possessed

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
a magical technology
with which they carved,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
shaped, and moved enormous
stones as though they

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.907 align:middle line:90%
were lighter than air.

00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
All this took place after
a crashing meteorite

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
caused a catastrophic flood that
wiped out most life on Earth.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
These temples, it was
said, are their legacy.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
By examining the myths and
folklore so carefully preserved

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Andes and
combining them with the latest

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
evidence, the megalithic
temples of the Andes

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
are coming alive once again,
revealing their secret

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.041 align:middle line:84%
as places of communication
with the gods.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
13,000 feet up in the
Andes sits Titicaca,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
the world's highest navigable
lake, once a formidable inland

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:90%
ocean.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
On its southern shore
lie the remains of two

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.987 align:middle line:90%
temples, Tiwanaku and Pumapunku.

00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Tiwanaku is probably the
world's oldest temple.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
The megaliths along its
central plaza reference

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
significant celestial events
along the horizon in 15,000 BC.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Despite its age
and destruction, it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
seems that something superhuman
was once at work here.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
The stones, quarried as
much as 55 miles away,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
were said to have been
moved through the air

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of a trumpet.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
It appears the
entire site was built

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:90%
using sound and anti-gravity.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:90%
But to what end?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
In the local Aymara
Language, Tiwanaku

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
means "navel at the center,"
indicating a location

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
where culture was seeded by
people described as godlike.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But the name is of
Polynesian origin,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and it also means
receiver-transmitter.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Tiwanaku, it seems, is a place
where humans can communicate

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.055 align:middle line:90%
with other levels of reality.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Then the most ancient
of Aymara legends

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
says there came a time
of "Unu Pachakuti,"

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:90%
the world overturned by water.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It describes how a
disintegrating comet

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
hit the Earth and generated a
flood whose waves reached even

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.997 align:middle line:90%
the tallest mountains.

00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
As the Earth trembled, the
waters of Lake Titicaca

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed the temple city
of Tiwanaku and Pumapunku.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
The legend also describes
how a builder god

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:84%
named Viracocha appeared at
Tiwanaku with his sister-wife.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And together with
seven shining beings,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
they were charged
with raising humans

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:90%
from a state of savagery.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They began by rebuilding
Tiwanaku and Pumapunku,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
crafting some of the
hardest rock on Earth

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
with laser-like precision that
even today modern technology

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:90%
is hard pressed to match.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of the masonry is
still in pristine condition

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
despite thousands
of years of neglect.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
One of its most
beautiful artifacts

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is the Sun Gate, carved from
a single piece of stone.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The ratio of its
length to height

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.388 align:middle line:84%
is the same as that between
the solar and lunar calendars.

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:10%
At the top, an effigy of
the creator god Pacha Kamaq

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:10%
holds two rods of power, the
twin serpents representing

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:10%
the masculine and feminine
energies that flow along

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:10%
the Earth and sustain all life.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
The adjacent bird figures
define the equinoxes, eclipses,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and other stellar information
as observed from this location,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
making this whole piece
one massive calendar,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
the observations of a
scientist, or a magician.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Viracocha and
companions are described

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
as being very different
to indigenous peoples.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
They were white-skinned,
bearded, fair-headed,

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and they understood the laws
of nature and how to bend them.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They were also
described as giants,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and there is evidence of a
different race of people that

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:90%
lived in the Andes long ago.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Analysis of unusual,
long-headed skulls discovered

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
throughout the region
reveals mitochondrial DNA

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
with mutations unknown in any
human, primate, or animal known

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
to science.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And what's more
bizarre, these people

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
appear to have originated in
Europe or the Middle East.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
If so, Viracocha and
his seven shining ones

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
may have been the same people
as another group of seven

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
tall beings, the
Egyptian Acu Shemsu

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Hor, the followers of
Horus, who likewise

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
appeared after a
catastrophic world flood

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.870 align:middle line:90%
to rebuild civilization.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
They, too, are said to have
moved stones through the air

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and created the foundations
of temples we see today.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The same story is
repeated in Sumeria,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
where this group
of seven gods were

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.975 align:middle line:84%
called Apkallu, often depicted
in Sumerian art as falcons.

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the highest
concentrations

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
of long-headed skulls ever
discovered in the Andes

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
is in Paracas, where a
400-foot-tall tree of life

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
is carved on the side of a
cliff like a geodesic marker.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.050 align:middle line:84%
The design features
an isosceles triangle.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And if this triangle
is superimposed

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
across the landscape, with
the second point in Tiwanaku,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
then the third point
marks the exact position

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:90%
of another ancient site, Cusco.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:84%
After Viracocha and
his seven shining ones

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
completed their
work at Tiwanaku,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%
they took their knowledge
300 miles northwest

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and established a second navel
of the Earth in this valley.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Cusco means "uncovered
navel stone."

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Cusco was already
ancient beyond memory

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
by the time Spanish
conquistadors arrived

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and enslaved the Inca.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
When they built
their cathedral, they

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
did so on top of
Viracocha original temple.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet elements of its former
glory are still visible today,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
such as the original
wall of basalt blocks

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that once encircled
the navel stone.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:10%
Its elegant curve and precision
have withstood the earthquakes

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:10%
that regularly destroy the
newer buildings all around.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Inside, the megalithic
masonry of the original temple

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
bears testament to the skill
of its ancient architects.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It once featured
seven rooms dedicated

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, moon, the Pleiades,
Venus, rain and thunder,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and Viracocha.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
400 sheets of gold
covered its walls,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
while in the center stood a
mythical scene of hundreds

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
of animals and stalks of
corn, all made of gold.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:10%
The Spanish melted
everything, and all

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:10%
that remains today is
this curious stone box,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:10%
carved from a single
piece of basalt.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Along the streets and
alleyways of old Cusco,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
there are reminders of
its megalithic origins.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Stones are fitted with
extraordinary precision,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
without mortar, by people
for whom shaping large rocks

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been as
easy as rolling pastry.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And as if this wasn't
enough of a challenge,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the megaliths
incorporate as much as 12

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:90%
different angles.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
The skilled masonry
often appears

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
beside the inferior
Incan stonework,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
revealing how the
knowledge has regressed

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
over thousands of years.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Many of the stones even have
an unusual reflective glaze

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that suggests an
extremely high heat was

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:90%
applied to create the joints.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But the greater mystery of
Cusco lies in its relationship

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
with two other local sites
overlooking the city--

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Saksaywaman and Qenqo.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And the three from a perfect
triangular relationship,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
a remarkable feat of
geodesy in itself,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
considering the challenging
altitude and steep terrain.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Reaching Saksaywaman requires
a steep, 700-foot climb.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a sprawling site, composed
of several different, yet

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:90%
interdependent, temples.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
The first tip of
the Cusco triangle

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is right here,
inside this horseshoe

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
of seven alcoves,
each representing

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:84%
the elements of Andean
creation, as well as

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
a reference to the stars in
the constellation associated

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:90%
with high wisdom, the Pleiades.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Few pay it much attention,
yet this is quite

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
possibly the oldest
and most important

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:90%
section of Saksaywaman.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Judging by its
present condition,

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:84%
it appears to have suffered
a major catastrophe long ago,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the same one that
brought Viracocha here.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
A few hundred yards
away lies this monolith.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:84%
It has been carved
from hard andesite,

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
with niches, false
doors, alcoves,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and stairs that lead nowhere.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Many of the features are
astronomically significant.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of such
house-sized boulders

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:84%
lie scattered
throughout the region,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
each resembling the plan
of a city in miniature.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But why they were made
is still a mystery.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Saksaywaman features
a large oval arena,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:84%
its perimeter fitted
with about 100 alcoves.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:84%
In addition to its function
as a solar and lunar calendar,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
it may also have been a
site where an initiation

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.365 align:middle line:90%
ritual was once performed.

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
A clue lies in this small
preparatory chamber,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
beside which a narrow
and awkward entrance

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:90%
has been cut into the bedrock.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It faces the equinox sunset, an
alignment that is traditionally

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:84%
associated with a secret
initiation in which candidates

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:84%
entered a tunnel
and found themselves

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.075 align:middle line:84%
navigating a claustrophobic
labyrinth in total darkness.

00:12:02.075 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to experience
the journey taken by the soul

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:84%
as it navigates the otherworld
during an out-of-body ritual.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Part of this labyrinth
of tunnels still exists.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
At the end, the
successful initiate

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
would exit to face the equinox
sunrise, to be proclaimed

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:90%
raised from the dead.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:10%
The ritual precedes
Christianity's idea

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:10%
of resurrection by
thousands of years

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:10%
and is repeated in the
Mediterranean legend of Theseus

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:10%
and the Minotaur,
the story of a hero

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:10%
who ventures into the
darkness of the underworld

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:10%
to metaphorically slay his
animal self so that he may

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:10%
return to face the
equinox sunrise as a risen

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:10%
or spiritualized hero.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The focal point of Saksaywaman
is a natural outcrop

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
of rock, once artificially
surrounded by walls

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:90%
of elegantly fitted stone.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.536 align:middle line:84%
This is the Andean depiction
of the mound of creation,

00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
the hill that first rose
out of the waters of chaos

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and where the knowledge of
the gods was first deposited.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Parts of its exposed
limestone actually

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
resemble water
tumbling like waves.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The mound is composed
of nine levels.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Like other sacred mounds
throughout the world,

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
the number is symbolic of
utmost perfection, a reminder

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual seeker of
the path that is required

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.046 align:middle line:90%
on the road to self-mastery.

00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
At the summit of this navel,
a nameless ancient artist

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:84%
carved a set of 13 steps
with extraordinary precision.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.524 align:middle line:84%
The steps reference
the lunar calendar.

00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
They also face the
distant horizon,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
as though expecting
a significant event.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And this occurs like
clockwork every 18.7 years,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
for the stepladder motif
marks the southernmost rising

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
of the moon before it
begins its journey back

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:90%
to the Northern Hemisphere.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It is from this
summit that one gets

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
a first glimpse of the
scale of the undulating

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:90%
walls of Saksaywaman.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
The megalithic construction
looks skilled and effortless.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Boulders appear as
though pulled into place,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
each stone fitted onto
the next without mortar,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
as though the gods
were playing with Lego.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Geologists have discovered how
the composition of the stone

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
differs from that at the
quarry, 20 miles away

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite
side of the valley.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Although the stone in the
quarry contains fossils,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:84%
these are not just missing
from the stones at Saksaywaman.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But the stone itself
appears to have

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
been subjected to an intense
heat of 1,500 degrees that

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
has recrystallized the stone.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Since this is impossible under
normal, natural conditions,

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
it implies that the ancient
builders of Saksaywaman

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and sites like it used some
kind of portable technology

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that is incompatible
with such a remote age.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It is also an excessive
amount of work

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
for what is supposed
to be nothing

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:90%
more than a protective wall.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%
There is a second possibility.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
In the 16th century,
two Jesuit priests

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
were walking the Inca Trail when
they came across an old grave.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:84%
As they rummaged
through the contents,

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
they found a clay vase which
was accidentally dropped,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
revealing a pungent
brown liquid.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
The priests were disappointed
to lose the vase and moved on.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
When they returned
the following day,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
they noticed that the rock
where the liquid had spilled

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:90%
had been made molten.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
This curious anecdote
may provide a major clue

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
as to how the megalith builders
molded their stone into place.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
They may have discovered a
type of organic molecular acid

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that is capable of
dissolving stone.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But why did the builders
arrange the walls of Saksaywaman

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
in three tiers and in
the shape of a zigzag?

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the design offers
tremendous structural integrity

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
in a region known for
violent earthquakes.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Yet a recent study of the
measurements of its 22 angles

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:84%
revealed them to be
astronomically significant.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They encode the mathematical
values of the cycle of the sun

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and moon, the
measurements of time,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the axial tilt of the Earth,
eclipses, and much more.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
The wall of Saksaywaman is
essentially a library in stone.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Was Viracocha and his
seven shining gods

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:90%
responsible for this marvel?

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
These traveling gods are
described as magicians

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and very tall.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:84%
To such people, the size of the
cornerstones of Saksaywaman,

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.890 align:middle line:84%
which measure 35
feet on average,

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:84%
would seem perfectly
normal to them.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
It is also worth noting
that the original threshold

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
stones of the gateways
are over 3 feet tall--

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
totally impractical for
normal humans, but a sensible

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
stepping stone for
very, very tall people.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The same situation appears in
the Egyptian temple of Edfu,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
where the followers
of Horus are described

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
as being 15 feet tall.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, there is a strong
Egyptian connection

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:90%
at Saksaywaman.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The name means "the place
of the satisfied falcon."

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:84%
While the condor is central
to Andean mythology,

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
the falcon is never mentioned.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So why name such a temple after
a bird that is symbolically

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:90%
insignificant in this region?

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And why should this
falcon be satisfied?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:84%
If an ancient Egyptian
were travelling here,

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:84%
he would understand the
implications of such a name

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
because in Egypt it was
synonymous with a temple

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:90%
complex of Saqqara.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Saqqara is named for Sokar,
the falcon god of rebirth.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, countless initiates
came to take part

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
in a secret ritual
marking the highest

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
level of initiation, the
ritual of living resurrection.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle line:84%
It required a candidate
to be interred

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
inside a dark chamber
for several days,

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
while his or her soul
explored the underworld.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.715 align:middle line:84%
When the initiate
regained consciousness,

00:18:41.715 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
he or she was led at dawn
to the top of a mount

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to witness the rising of
Venus before the sunrise.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The ritual was conducted on the
winter solstice and the spring

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:90%
equinox.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
This ritual may have taken
place at Saksaywaman.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
From the air, the zigzag walls
resemble the feathers and wings

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:90%
of a large bird.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And as long as
traditional records,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
there has been a festival
here every winter solstice,

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
celebrating the
resurrection of the sun.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Seen from an observation
tower on the summit,

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the edges of the walls
mark the exact position

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
of the rising sun
at the solstices,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
while every eight
years Venus rises along

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
the spine of Saksaywaman.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The event marked the high
point of this important ritual.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
A short walk along an
ancient ceremonial route

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
stands another mound,
deliberately surrounded

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:90%
by an expertly built enclosure.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:84%
The bedrock has been carved into
all manner of intriguing shapes

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
for a purpose that
remains unknown.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Similar sculptures exist on
the other side of the Pacific

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Moiwa in
Japan, the location

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.355 align:middle line:84%
of a similar culture also placed
in a remote age, a time of gods

00:20:12.355 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:84%
who appeared following
a global flood.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Adjacent to the site
lies a colossal limestone

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:90%
butte called Qenqo.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.045 align:middle line:84%
It marks the third point
of the Cusco triangle.

00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
It, too, has been
carved with stairways

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that lead to the
sky, niches, curves,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
libation bowls, and other
unusual shapes in the stone.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Most impressive of
all, its interior

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
has been hollowed
out into a chamber.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Qenqo may have been the final
stop for initiates performing

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:84%
their duties at Saksaywaman,
the last stage of the living

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:90%
resurrection ritual.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Even before the Inca arrived,
it was already known locally

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:84%
as the door to the otherworld,
and enough evidence

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:90%
survives to support the theory.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Outside the chamber, there
is a preparatory area

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
composed of a curving wall,
shaped into 17 alcoves.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
This number is common to
temples around the world

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
where the same ritual
took place, notably

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
the great mound of Knowth in
Ireland with its 17 satellite

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
mounds and the Osirian at
Abydos with its 17 side chambers

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
where the mysteries of these
resurrected god men, Osiris,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.912 align:middle line:90%
were once conducted.

00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
After preparing,
candidates at Qenqo

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
were led to the entrance, which
is reached by a passage cut out

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of the bedrock facing
the equinox sunset.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The low entrance forces a
person to enter in humility.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Inside, the dark
chamber is elegantly

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
hollowed out of the limestone
into various alcoves,

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
with a central,
freestanding structure where

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
one can lie down and spend a
few solitary nights wrapped

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
inside a protected room,
again in accordance

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.216 align:middle line:84%
with the procedures
of initiation.

00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
At dawn on the third
day, the initiate

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
would leave via
an S-shaped tunnel

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and into a courtyard
to witness Venus rising

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%
before the equinox sun.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The face of the bedrock has
been artificially caught

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
at an angle of 23 degrees to
allow this to be witnessed.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the ritual was to
allow the soul of the initiate

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
access to specialized
knowledge that can only

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:90%
be obtained in the otherworld.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It is therefore significant
that a second passage

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
has been skillfully
cut and angled

00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
in this limestone boulder to
allow the trajectory of Sirius

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to be observed on the solstice.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Like Venus, Sirius
was a star venerated

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:84%
by the Andean people and
other ancient cultures

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:90%
as the source of wisdom.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
This bright star
can be seen rising

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
above bedrock that has
been artificially cut

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:90%
beside the courtyard.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems these temples
fulfilled purposes

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that were both practical
as well as spiritual.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more to
Cusco than meets the eye.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The mountain peaks surrounding
the navel of the Earth

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
mark the passage of the Milky
Way, which the Andeans regarded

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:90%
as Mayu, the celestial river.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Seen from Cusco, the
mountains establish

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
an intercardinal horizon.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.055 align:middle line:10%
And as the river of stars
arcs through the night,

00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:10%
it creates a cosmic axis.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:10%
This was recreated and marked
on the ground with sacred sites

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:10%
called huacas, 328
of them, representing

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:10%
the time it takes the moon
to complete 12 cycles.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It was believed
that by mirroring

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
the perfection of the sky, a
cosmic order was established

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
on the ground that permeated
through all aspects

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of everyday life.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
One of these sacred
sites is Quillarumiyoc.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It is a large site containing a
preparatory temple, waterways,

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and a step pyramid, and a
path gradually leading uphill

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:90%
to a small cave.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But its most curious
feature is a huge boulder

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
on whose face someone cut a
semicircular bowl with seven

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.997 align:middle line:90%
steps with great precision.

00:24:51.997 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The device appears to be
another calendrical masterpiece,

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
for each step references
the solstices,

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:84%
equinox, and the major and
minor standstills of the moon.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Its alignments
may help establish

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:90%
a possible date for the site.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The ark of this stellar dial
marks the three prominent stars

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:90%
of the Andean people--

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, Capella,
and the Pleiades.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:10%
And this conjunction
last occurred at sunset

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:10%
on the summer
solstice in 3100 BC.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The design is also a
symbolic gesture to Viracocha

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.849 align:middle line:84%
and the seven shining
gods who brought

00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:35.890 align:middle line:90%
this wisdom to the Andes.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The huacas that
encircle Cusco are not

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:90%
placed at random on the land.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:84%
They are each positioned
along ley lines

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that radiate outward from the
navel stone, each one appearing

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to reference astronomically
significant objects in the sky.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.485 align:middle line:84%
One of the most intriguing
of these is Amaru Machay.

00:25:59.485 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Amaru means serpent, referring
to the pathways of the Earth's

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
energy that flow into each
of the chambers carved out

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:90%
of the living rock.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The stone inside the
chambers is covered

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
with an unusual ceramic
glaze composed of aluminium,

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:90%
magnesium, and silica.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
How this was done is not
known, but inside the effect

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:90%
on the senses is palpable.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Another intriguing
sight is found halfway

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
up a steep ravine, where
someone carved an entrance

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.655 align:middle line:90%
into the mountainside.

00:26:39.655 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Then they slashed the
bedrock with great precision

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:90%
to create a false door.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:10%
The same design feature
appears in Persia and Egypt.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:10%
This site is called
Naupa Iglesia.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:10%
A naupa is an inhabitant
of the spirit world.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not by accident
they are referred

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to as spirit doors or
windows into paradise

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
because these alcoves mark
the passage of the Earth's

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.805 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic currents.

00:27:13.805 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:90%
The measurements are not random.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They conform to
musical notation.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
The length-to-height
ratio is three to one,

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
making a perfect fifth
in the second octave.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The ratio of the alcove is
five to six, a minor third.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The five-to-six ratio
describes the rotation

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, whose
pole completes

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
one full rotation of
its axis every 25,920

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
years, while the planet tilts
4 degrees every 21,600 years,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.880 align:middle line:90%
a ratio of 5 to 6.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
This accurate calculation of
the motions of the planets

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
is also encoded in another
unusual temple, the Bent

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid of Egypt.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Dominating this
unique environment

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:90%
is the cave ceiling.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It has been sliced like butter
at two different angles,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:90%
creating another mystery.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:84%
One angle is 60
degrees, the other 52.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
There is only one
other place on Earth

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:84%
where these two numbers
appear side by side--

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:84%
the angles of the slopes of
the two major pyramids at Giza.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Yet again, the echo
of ancient Egypt

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
permeates the
temples of the Andes.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:84%
There is another anomaly
in this sacred space.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Its creator picked
the exact spot

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the
mountain where exists

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:90%
a single outcrop of bluestone.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
The three-step design
defines the Andean view

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
the creative underworld,
the physical middle world,

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:90%
and the ethereal otherworld.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The central niche is also cut
to musical notation, the ratio,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:90%
three to two, a perfect fifth.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Bluestone contains
a type of crystal

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that was used in early
radio receivers because

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:84%
of its excellent
transmitting qualities.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The rock is also
magnetic, a useful feature

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:90%
for shamanic journeying.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:84%
The same stone was
once chosen to build

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:90%
the oldest part of Stonehenge.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It seems that Naupa
Iglesia was designed

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
by a cosmic artist
for anyone wishing

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to access another
level of reality

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:90%
and communicate with the gods.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Just as the Egyptians
regard the river Nile

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:84%
as the terrestrial
counterpart of the Milky Way,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
so the Aymara, the Quechua,
and the Puquina people

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.270 align:middle line:90%
have the Urubamba.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:10%
Around the winter solstice,
the sacred marriage

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:10%
of Isis and Osiris
was celebrated

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:10%
in the temples along the
Nile, while in Peru it

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:10%
was the festival of Capac Raymi,
when pilgrimage was undertaken

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:10%
and people paid tribute
at the temples that

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:10%
line the banks of the Urubamba.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It began with gatherings
at sacred springs,

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
such as Tambomachay, during
which the waters were blessed

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and ritual bathing purified
pilgrims on the long journey

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:90%
The pilgrim trail was arduous.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It followed the meandering river
valley and the narrow trail

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:90%
along steep mountainsides.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:84%
People would rest and pray at
the temple complex of Pisac,

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.923 align:middle line:84%
built onto a natural spur
overlooking the Urubamba.

00:30:55.923 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:84%
The terracing around
Pisac is a wonder

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:90%
of engineering in itself.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The next stop along the
trail was Ollantaytambo.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Six colossal stone blocks,
made of andesite and polished

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:84%
pink porphyry make
up the sacred area,

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
part of a destroyed
megalithic temple

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.694 align:middle line:90%
called the House of the Dawn.

00:31:29.694 --> 00:31:31.235 align:middle line:84%
The stones appear
as though machined.

00:31:31.235 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
There are over 30
300-ton megaliths

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:84%
here, perhaps the
biggest masonry

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
to be found in this valley,
in a style resembling

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:90%
that of Tiwanaku.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Carved on the face of the
stones is a step ladder relief

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
called a chakana, meaning
to bridge or cross.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It represents the three
levels of existence.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the mastery of
this spiritual ideal that

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
allowed the soul to transmit
the cosmic vault to access

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:84%
all levels of reality, the
benefit being immortal life.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:13.330 align:middle line:84%
The same design appears
in ancient Egypt.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Gazing at this temple from the
steep hill across the valley

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:84%
is the place where
the god descends.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:25.030 align:middle line:84%
It is the carved face of Pacha
Kamaq, the regenerative creator

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:90%
god of the Andes.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Pacha means universe,
and Kamaq, to animate.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.440 align:middle line:84%
He was depicted as an old,
androgynous, gray-bearded giant

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:90%
who carried a staff.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
His nickname, Tunupa,
means load bearer,

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:84%
upon whose shoulders
the vault of the heavens

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:90%
rotates perpetually.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Above his head, a small
temple stands like a crown.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:84%
The pilgrim trail continues
into the heart of the Andes,

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.145 align:middle line:84%
culminating in a lush,
mountainous landscape

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and a 2,000-foot climb to
the city in the clouds,

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Machu Picchu.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Pilgrims would complete
the winter solstice

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.850 align:middle line:84%
ritual of Capac Raymi with
festivities in the main plaza.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:84%
This area of Machu Picchu is
part of the public section.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
There is also the
sacred section called

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Yampu, the dwelling
place of the gods.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And it stands on its
own natural mound.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.530 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:84%
This area was
accessed only by those

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.255 align:middle line:84%
who had received special
training in the mystery

00:33:40.255 --> 00:33:41.055 align:middle line:90%
secrets.

00:33:41.055 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:84%
The sacred section is the
mirror image of the gods

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:90%
and of the heavens.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It was considered perfect.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And so its priests were
sensitive to anyone

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.850 align:middle line:84%
who would bring impurity
of thought or action

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:90%
into the sacred space.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
If the dwelling place of
the gods was compromised,

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
the city would fall, and with
it the cohesion of the tribe.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.090 align:middle line:84%
This exact location is
linked to two other locations

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
across Peru also
associated with Viracocha

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and his group of traveling
gods, Paracas and Matarani,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
from where they were last seen
disappearing into the Pacific

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The three sites form
a perfect triangle.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It's in this sacred section
that we find the oldest

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:90%
megalithic masonry.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are three
stages of construction here.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
The prehistoric uses stone
of extraordinary scale.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The later stage features
beautifully cut and fitted

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:84%
masonry, just as in
Cusco and Tiwanaku.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The stones are so tightly fitted
that even an alpaca hair could

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:90%
not be inserted between them.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The newer masonry
is that of the Inca

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:04.865 align:middle line:84%
period, where stones are smaller
and the fitting less precise.

00:35:04.865 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.540 align:middle line:84%
At the summit of Machu
Picchu sits the Intihuatana,

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the hitching post of the
sun, where astronomer priests

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
announced the exact moment
when the sun reached

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:90%
its maximum position in the sky.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And they figuratively
tied it to the stone

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:84%
so as to cause it to move
in the opposite direction.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The Intihuatana's
14-degree declination

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
means that at midday
on the equinox

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:90%
the sun casts no shadow.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It is said to sit with all
of its might upon the pillar.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Each angle aligns
the stellar events

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
such as the position
of the moon, Pleiades,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.305 align:middle line:90%
and Southern Cross.

00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.620 align:middle line:84%
The sacred precinct
was the place

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to where a small
group of initiates

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.940 align:middle line:84%
were led aside from
the rest of the crowd

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
during the winter
solstice celebration.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Here, they prepared themselves
for the final initiation

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:90%
ritual.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:84%
This included
further understanding

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of the mystery
secrets, part of which

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:84%
was taught in a
restricted chamber

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
beneath this
observational tower.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:84%
This unusual room has been
carved out of the bedrock.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:84%
A shallow wall has been
cut into angled steps

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to allow the rising
equinox sun to shine

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:33.070 align:middle line:84%
onto specific parts of the
chamber at prescribed periods.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Inside, two shallow doorways
have been carefully fitted.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:42.070 align:middle line:84%
One represents truth
and the other falsehood.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It is an important teaching
on the path to initiation

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:90%
called the two ways.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It was still taught in the
5th century BC in the mystery

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.075 align:middle line:90%
schools of Greece.

00:36:52.075 --> 00:36:56.200 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet the final phase
of this unique ritual

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.000 align:middle line:84%
was not performed
at Machu Picchu,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:84%
but on the mountain
that so dominates

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:84%
the sacred city, the
beehive-shaped hill of Huayna

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Picchu.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Huayna Picchu is 400 feet closer
to the sky and very steep.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.940 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The unusual shape
acts like a coil,

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
attracting the electromagnetic
currents generated

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:84%
by the Urubamba
River as it flows

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in an arc around the
base of the hill.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The beehive shape
is itself symbolic.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It is the shape
associated with temples

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:84%
where the living resurrection
initiation took place

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.600 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The path to the top is
steep and challenging,

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:84%
mirroring the spiritual
training common in such temples.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But before initiates set their
sights on reaching the summit,

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.870 align:middle line:84%
they first had to descend 1,200
feet to a secluded temple.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The restricted temple is set
among absolute stillness.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It is yet another superb example
of a sacred site expertly cut

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.600 align:middle line:84%
into the bedrock, with
a series of niches

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
set under a colossal boulder
that seems to defy gravity.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.125 align:middle line:90%
It faces the equinox sunset.

00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:21.880 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:84%
In 3100 BC, initiates
retiring to this man-made womb

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:84%
would have observed
Orion, the constellation

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.940 align:middle line:84%
marking the gateway
to the otherworld,

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:84%
descending behind the
mountains followed by Sirius,

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.930 align:middle line:90%
the star of knowledge.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, initiates would
spend several nights

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
in an induced near-death
state while the soul wandered

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:90%
and experienced the otherworld.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Like other temples used
for the same ritual,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.260 align:middle line:84%
it is presided by
a lunar goddess.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.180 align:middle line:84%
At the end of this
initiation, they

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:84%
would make the final
arduous ascent to the summit

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:84%
before sunrise and greet the
morning star, Venus, whereupon

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.200 align:middle line:84%
they were declared newborn
or risen from the dead.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:90%


00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
They also got a fantastic
view of Machu Picchu.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu
form a ritual landscape,

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is revealed
in their names.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The first means
old bird, referring

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to Machu Picchu as a place
where the old self comes to die,

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
metaphorically speaking, while
Huayna Picchu means young bird,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.980 align:middle line:84%
a place where the
new self is born.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:57.080 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Like other initiation
traditions going back

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:84%
at least 5,000 years, the
Andean spiritual system

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:84%
taught that the soul of a
living person that experiences

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
a resurrection does
so by undertaking

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:90%
a journey to the otherworld.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Accounts of this
journey describe

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
a bridge across a
raging river and how

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:84%
the soul crosses the river
assisted by black dogs

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
capable of seeing
in the dark, just

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.120 align:middle line:84%
like the Egyptian story
of Anubis and Apuat

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and the Greek legend
of the hounds of Hades.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And in the Andes, we
find these two dogs

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in the most
unlikeliest of places--

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Lake Titicaca.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:41.760 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.060 align:middle line:84%
When the level of the lake was
much higher than it is today,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:84%
the mesa of Cutimbo
was an island.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Here we find the most unusual
stone towers, called chullpas.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Although conventional
archeology believes

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:01.380 align:middle line:84%
they were burial places,
the Aymara disagree.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They call them "uta
amaya," houses of the soul,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.130 align:middle line:84%
not for the soul,
indicating they

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
were used as places
of facilitation

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:90%
rather than burial.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The entrance to each chullpa
faces the ritual direction

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.454 align:middle line:84%
of the equinoxes sunrise,
and their interiors

00:41:20.454 --> 00:41:21.495 align:middle line:90%
are shaped like beehives.

00:41:21.495 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.230 align:middle line:84%
When the sun casts its lights
upon the pillow-shaped stones

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
at midday, reliefs of
a bride and a groom

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.570 align:middle line:84%
reveal themselves
above the entrance,

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:84%
indicating that
inside this chamber

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
the initiate engaged
with a sacred marriage

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:90%
with a divine bride.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:84%
This symbol is known the world
over in temples used strictly

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:90%
for this secret ritual.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But more tellingly,
the reliefs of two dogs

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that guide the soul
in the underworld

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.550 align:middle line:84%
appear either side
of the tiny entrance.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Not far from Cutimbo
is the mesa Sillustani,

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.640 align:middle line:10%
still surrounded by
the water of what

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:10%
used to be Lake Titicaca
around 7,000 BC.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.770 align:middle line:10%
The towers taper
from the top down,

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:10%
complete with beehive
interiors and doors facing

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:10%
the equinox sunrise.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.320 align:middle line:84%
These were probably
built by the Puquina

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:90%
long before the ancient Aymara.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Sillustani is a naturally
magnetic environment.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Surrounded by water,
its basalt and sandstone

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
attracts and stores an
electromagnetic charge,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:84%
making the entire mesa
an ideal environment

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:84%
for shamanic journeying rather
than a place to bury the dead.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:52.840 align:middle line:84%
This ongoing theme
of communication

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:84%
between the worlds
seems to have been

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.750 align:middle line:84%
central to the philosophy of
Viracocha and his shining gods,

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
seeing as the temples
between Tiwanaku and Cusco

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
follow this idea,
and none more so

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:84%
than an unusual hill on the
western shore of Lake Titicaca

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:90%
called Hayu Marca.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
High in iron oxide, Hayu Marca
feels like a place set aside

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.630 align:middle line:90%
from the normal world.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, the name
means "city of the gods."

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Along its eastern face,
an ancient architect

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:31.800 align:middle line:84%
carved an immense
portal and a spirit door

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.420 align:middle line:90%
facing the equinox sunrise.

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The Quechua name of the
portal is 'Amaru Meru,"

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:90%
the place of the serpent.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So this place marks
the Earth's naturally

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:90%
flowing pathways of energy.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.060 align:middle line:10%
The native people speak
of this as a gateway

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.890 align:middle line:10%
to the lands of the gods.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And in times long
past, great heroes

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:84%
passed through this gate
for a glorious new life

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.970 align:middle line:84%
of immortality in the
world of the gods.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The legend concludes
with a prophecy

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.650 align:middle line:84%
that this doorway will
one day open many times

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.350 align:middle line:84%
bigger than it actually
is, allowing the gods

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.560 align:middle line:90%
to return in their sun ships.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, local people
respect this temple,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
for they often see
strange people dressed

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.030 align:middle line:84%
in unusual clothing
emerging from it

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and walking towards
Lake Titicaca.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:31.850 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we return
to where we began,

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:84%
to this inland ocean,
the birthplace of gods,

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.225 align:middle line:84%
of legends of the superhuman
Viracocha and the temples

00:44:44.225 --> 00:44:48.230 align:middle line:84%
he built to last into
our time, reminding us

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:84%
that if we should
follow the example

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.010 align:middle line:84%
he set so many
thousands of years

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:84%
ago, that by tuning in to
the sacred places of the gods

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and following in
their footsteps,

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.830 align:middle line:90%
we may yet become like them.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:39.136 align:middle line:90%
