00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.815 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
you need right now.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand that you've been
dealing with some challenges

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and feeling kind of
stuck in life right now.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about it.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'd like to speak to
you about the key of harmony

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and tell you a little
about my story.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
As you know, we
all have a story.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's pain
is their own pain.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all relative.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly
not a competition.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I was highly successful
in the business world

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and made a lot of money,
in particular for a woman.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:10%
But I was a VP of a
multinational organization

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:10%
responsible for $600
million worth of business.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people on the outside
thought I had it all together.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:10%
But in fact, I was
emotionally bankrupt.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But let me share with
you some of the traumatic

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and some of the crisis that
I've gone through in my life

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
to get where I am today.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
When I was 13 years old, I was
gang raped by some neighborhood

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:90%
boys in my area.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:84%
This was in a lovely
small town where

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:90%
everybody knew each other.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I never told a soul.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
15, my very best friend

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
was kidnapped,
raped, and murdered.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you're 15,
you're not emotionally mature.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot to take on.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was 18,
my new best friend--

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I ventured into allowing myself
to have another friendship--

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
was killed in a high
speed car accident.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So a series of
compounding traumas

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
sent me into this
space of disassociation

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and disconnection
with my true self.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And so for the rest
of my next 25 years,

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I'd be fueled by anger and fear.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I became an extreme
overachiever.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I was
dealing with the loss

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of my mother, my brother
missing, this marriage ending.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I had
come back to the US.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We were living in
Dubai at the time.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to take all
of my money and his money

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and take it to Dubai.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in
Dubai, it's Sharia law.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So at that low moment, I had
to scrape together credit cards

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:90%
to get back to Canada.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had no money,
as I mentioned.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I ended up living
in the basement

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:90%
of one of my former employees.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank god for her.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
In that basement at
rock bottom, imagine

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
coming from a millionaire's
life to living

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
in your own employee's
basement suite.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And I really came
to my realization.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You know I said to
myself, how am I here?

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:90%
How did I end up here?

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:90%
What is the meaning of this?

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I discovered
that what I'd been looking for

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:90%
was actually safety.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to
trust myself and let

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
myself know that, guess
what, life is risky.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And so for me, in that basement,
having this realization

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:10%
of looking for safety--

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:10%
well, where was I
going to get safety?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I needed to learn
to trust myself.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started to make
some shifts in my life.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:10%
Prayer was a huge piece for me.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:10%
So I'd love to offer
up that you think

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:10%
about looking at preparing
yourself for releasing also.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:10%
Releasing behaviors,
releasing habits,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:10%
releasing some of the
people in your life

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:10%
that maybe keep hooking
you and pulling you under.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And look for people
who will absolutely

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
hold you accountable to the
changes you want to make.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly Lee, thank you so
much for your time today.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:90%
This has been amazing.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think your
story is so powerful

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
it might take Sophia a little
while to really understand

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:90%
the key of harmony.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But you understand that
with everything Kelly

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Lee's been through, she's
just so successful again

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and is in harmony with herself.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I see that for
you, I really do.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.997 align:middle line:84%
Sophia, we are in a very
special room right now.

00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be able to go visit

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
with some incredible
thought leaders virtually.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.505 align:middle line:84%
We're going to jump into another
dimension and meet with them.

00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to
love technology.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.735 align:middle line:10%
[QUIET MUSIC]

00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:01.208 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSHING]

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be your take on
really the purpose of life?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Why are we all here?

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The most expressive part,
when I think about the meaning

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:10%
of life and the expression
of life, is this.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:10%
We all, a lot of times,
practice being who we are.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:10%
And that's the problem.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:10%
You have to start with,
spiritually, who you are first.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:10%
The first key of real power is
to spiritually look at yourself

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:10%
from that divine
spiritual place,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:10%
and measure the world
from there instead

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:10%
of that sad, poor, pitiful,
downtrodden, unhappy, living

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.123 align:middle line:10%
in hell individual.

00:11:38.123 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's very
simple for me.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.430 align:middle line:84%
We come here with a
very important job.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:90%
We come here to work.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'm working
with this human, Miguel.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Miguel is a wonderful,
beautiful body.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's where I work.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I work in Miguel, trying
to do the best I can.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Miguel is matter.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:90%
I am life.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Trying to force who shape
matter, who creates everything.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Because life is not just the
workers working in Miguel.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's the one who is working
in you, in everybody around.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
He is the one who opened the
flowers to move the queen.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.152 align:middle line:90%
Then life is half of the truth.

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Or we can say it's
the whole truth,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and matter is just the
consequences of life.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:10%
We work in matter.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:10%
I work in Miguel as you're
working in yourself.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Everybody is working.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.245 align:middle line:10%
Then my purpose is to create
in Miguel the best I can.

00:12:51.245 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think what I am.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:90%
I know what I am.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.675 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
realization that I've

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:90%
had for a really long time.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is that I know
I'm a divine being.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:10%
And I know that when I am living
in my truth, it's the divine--

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.046 align:middle line:10%


00:13:05.046 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Let it flow.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Come on, let it flow.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the divine being
expressed through me.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:10%
Own that.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:10%
The moment you own that, you
become the secret of the keys.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:90%
You become it.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not memorizing something
like you do in kindergarten.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming something.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We can all memorize something,
but it's becoming something.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And when your heart
just opened up

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
to express to us, the council,
we celebrate that opening.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
We cherish that opening,
because everybody

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:90%
comes there sooner or later.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Just the sooner you can get
there, the better off you are.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.726 align:middle line:84%
And you can keep from doing
some really stupid things.

00:13:41.726 --> 00:13:43.287 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:43.287 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're serving an example
to me of what not to do.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly!

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:10%
We can't tell you what
to do, but we can exactly

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:10%
tell you what not to do.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:10%
So be blessed in
this journey, Jim.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:10%
And travel safe.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:10%
And look when you need
us, come back to us.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:10%
We'll be here.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And remember, becoming the
keys adds to this expression.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:10%
You get access to
higher counseling.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:10%
You know, we think
that we're the same

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.345 align:middle line:10%
until we attune ourselves
through meditation,

00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:10%
through proper diet.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:10%
We attune ourselves
to that frequency

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:10%
that's our divine
connection-- not

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:10%
our intellectual,
emotional connection.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Your competitors
wake up every morning

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
thinking about putting
you out of business

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
by serving customers
better than you do.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.355 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't wake up
every morning thinking

00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:84%
about putting them
out of the business,

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:84%
then they're going
to eat your lunch.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:84%
As Jack Welch once said,
if you don't do it,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.207 align:middle line:90%
the end is in sight.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So continuous and never
ending improvement--

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:90%
never become complacent.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Complacency is
the greatest enemy

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of success in a fast
moving business world.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Always be looking for ways to
make your customers happier.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I have a little thing.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.412 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking of writing a book.

00:21:03.412 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of
ER, emergency room.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of writing
a book called "ER."

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing is "How
to Succeed in a Business, ER."

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we say if you
want to make a sale,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
you have to make
your customer happy.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But then your competitor
wants that customer as well,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:90%
as I just said.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So the competitor will
match whatever you say.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like poker
here in Las Vegas.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to match the previous
bet to stay in the game.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So your competitor will
match whatever you do

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:90%
and very, very fast.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Faster today than ever before.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So then you have to
make them happier.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's the "er" that
determines your success

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the happier.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to serve them faster.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It has to be convenienter.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:90%
It has to be newer.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It has to be cheaper.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:90%
It has to be something "er."

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So everything in our world
today depends upon the "er."

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
If we can serve our
customers faster,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
better, easier, cheaper,
more conveniently, and so on,

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle line:90%
we win.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So everything is "er,"
which is continuous,

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:90%
never ending improve.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.925 align:middle line:84%
Always looking for ways to
own the E-R, to own the "er."

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.825 align:middle line:90%
>> So good.

00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:10.725 align:middle line:90%
Wow, awesome.

00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:12.115 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm back.

00:22:12.115 --> 00:22:12.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey!

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:13.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Sophia.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Did you enjoy what
Brian Tracy had to say?

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
He's so inspiring.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.535 align:middle line:90%
I love what he had to say.

00:22:21.535 --> 00:22:22.335 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:23.135 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:22:23.135 --> 00:22:24.495 align:middle line:90%
>> I get it.

00:22:24.495 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Finally.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:90%
So glad.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Things are

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%

more positive.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so glad.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm so grateful.

and hostility behind.

00:22:40.675 --> 00:22:41.475 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:22:41.475 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, starting right now.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And I realize that everyone
has challenges every day.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That is such a
powerful lesson, Sophia.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
The challenges we
face every day--

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.540 align:middle line:90%
they don't need to define us.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they give us the
opportunity to grow and even

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:90%
help and empower others.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:90%

a present for you.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

Why don't you say
them with me now?

00:23:15.555 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Appreciation, harmony,
passion, courage, faith,

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:90%
vibration, and empathy.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%

something all the time.

>> Oh, what in particular?

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you
lost your job and went

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:90%
through all your money?

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how about the fact
we know that you went through

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:90%
a really nasty divorce?

a very nasty divorce.

a message for you.

And what I'm guided to
talk to you about today

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:90%
is the key of appreciation.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful
element to that.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It's appreciating yourself.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You see, when I
was 19, I actually

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
went through a really
difficult time.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I lost several
friends to suicide.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I had two other friends
get in awful car accidents.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, my family
was falling apart.

My mother was having
a nervous breakdown.

Can you imagine all of this
happening in a two month span?

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:90%
And I stopped caring about me.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:10%
I lost the appreciation
for myself.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Luckily, somebody was there.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.990 align:middle line:84%
There was an angel, a human
angel that first appeared.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And she brought to
me how to meditate.

that I was struggling.

I hid it well from everyone.

And there is a light at the end.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So I meditated for the
first time in my life.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm an analytical person,
so I read the instructions.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:90%
I went home, I go through this.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in this part of
my brain the whole time.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm a ones and zeros person.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.853 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually a programmer.

00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:84%
At the time when
I was in college,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I was studying to
be a programmer.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And then, the light opened.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a light with
my eyes open or closed.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, an angel
actually manifested in the room

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> A literal angel.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> A literal angel, yes.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know it
sounds fantastical.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I stood there in this
presence of this beauty,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and my analytical mind and my
spiritual mind did not line up.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it doesn't.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Look at where I am with
these two spiritual guides.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say so.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And I kept this a secret for 30
years, even from my own family.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I told my father
just a few years ago,

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:84%
the night my mother
was going to pass away.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I knew where she was
going, it's just love.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
else on that side.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:84%
The great picture
that God paints

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
for us, we never see
the entire canvas.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.477 align:middle line:84%
Just believe that picture
is absolutely beautiful.

00:31:09.477 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of life.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I knew you would have the
perfect message for Emma,

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:84%
because she's just been
so down in the dumps.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:84%
If anyone can get her out
of the dumps, it's you.

She is amazing.

and the real estate industry.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I got my severance, and
they treated me wonderful.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
done after 23 years.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of took
time for me and my health

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a little
Juliette journey.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I kind of was where you are now.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Not lost, but where's my next--

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you do.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:90%
You go back to your passion.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
writing and authoring,

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:84%
coaching came into my life, and
this whole magnificent inner

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.890 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
height of that, I

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:84%
was going to do a
conference in Cruz.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I had authors and
inspirational speakers.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I had worked a year.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And a week before that
sailing to Alaska,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I got diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Which was the strangest thing,
because Breast Cancer Angels

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:90%
was my charity.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So for every sailing
that we booked,

it gave back to our charity.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.677 align:middle line:84%
And of course I
was thinking wait,

00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one giving
the inspiration.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was just OK, where
are we going with this?

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I had to trust the journey.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I was the lucky one.

You know, you're starting
to get your mammograms.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:90%
I was 50 years old, 2013.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It's when you start getting
all those tests and everything.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Super small, had the lumpectomy,
in surgery radiation.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's all I
experienced, in surgery.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I woke up, and I was good to go.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Free and clear,
lymph nodes clear.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.380 align:middle line:90%
I was the lucky one.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.890 align:middle line:10%
So I hear you're going through
some challenges in your life

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:19.690 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I can definitely relate.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:84%
There was a time in my
life about 25, 30 years ago

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to die.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with Crohn's
disease just out of college.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an autoimmune disease
of the intestinal track.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.960 align:middle line:10%
And the doctors told
me there was no cure.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
All I could do is take
medicines and maybe end up

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:90%
with surgery as my only options.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So not knowing better, I
just followed what they said,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:90%
and I lived this horrible life.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
the horror story

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:90%
version of "Groundhog Day."

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my goodness.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I would just try to
sleep to avoid the pain.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, I would
have to wake up, make

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
my way to the bathroom,
basically crawl.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I couldn't
even stand up straight.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I would pass out, I was so weak.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And I begged god to stop this.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:08.890 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Like holy crap, this is
not the circle of life

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:90%
that I intended for myself.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.742 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
I could go on.

00:35:14.742 --> 00:35:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to go on.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But God said no,
it's not your time.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You have a mission
to accomplish.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:10%
And then, the doctors said
the only thing they could do

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:10%
is maybe shut off
my immune system

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:10%
with an immunosuppressive drug.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The theory was my immune
system was overactive,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.577 align:middle line:90%
so let's shut it off.

00:35:33.577 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:84%
However the side effect, if you
want to call it a side effect,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
is that I could
potentially get a cold that

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:84%
could turn into a deadly
case of pneumonia.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So I started thinking
about it like a puzzle,

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:90%
'cause I love games.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's why God
showed me a puzzle.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought there wasn't any
one thing that got me sick.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.360 align:middle line:84%
It was like a perfect
storm of all these pieces

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:90%
that came together.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So couldn't the same
be true to get me well?

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I just had to find
the right pieces

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.787 align:middle line:84%
mentally, physically,
emotionally, spiritually.

00:36:00.787 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:10%
After I made this
decision, though, I really

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.480 align:middle line:10%
didn't know how I
was going to do this.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I had no roadmap to follow.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.582 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't the internet
back then like there is now.

00:36:09.582 --> 00:36:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anybody
else that was sick.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I just had my belief that
I could find harmony,

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that I could find balance
and be the key of harmony.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So thankfully-- I
don't even remember

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:90%
who it was I was so ill.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:84%
My memory was a
little bit shoddy.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:10%
You know, when you're
so malnourished

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:10%
you don't really have
much brain function.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Gave me "Dr. Atkins
Health Revolution" book.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And it had a section in it
about the disease I had.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought wow,
this the first time

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I heard of a doctor saying
natural ways to heal myself.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, I live
in New Jersey.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go to
his clinic in New York,

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and he taught me
how to eat properly

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to stop feeding the
yeast and candida that

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:90%
was causing the inflammation.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I had to work on my mind,
emotions, and thoughts.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the disease of
all that was creating

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.295 align:middle line:90%
this disease in my body.

00:36:57.295 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Mind, emotion, and thoughts.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was like all
or nothing, good or bad.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I just saw things
in black and white.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn
to find my balance.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
thankfully, I did

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:84%
with the help of my late
husband's unconditional love.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.910 align:middle line:84%
He married me when
I weighed 85 pounds.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know if I'd live or die.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And he saw the
true spirit of me--

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the whole me, not this frail
person, this human that

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.780 align:middle line:90%
was in front of him.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:90%
His spirit saw my spirit.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I guess he finished and
accomplished his mission

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:38.650 align:middle line:84%
in life, and he passed 10
years ago to a heart attack.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, three years
later I was lucky enough

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.573 align:middle line:90%
to find another man in my life.

00:37:43.573 --> 00:37:45.240 align:middle line:10%
And then, God took
him to the other side

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:10%
three years after
we were together.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was done, Emma.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was done.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I was in that dark, dark place.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:90%
I was Darth Vader.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I was doing to the dark side.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
know God anymore.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, we're enemies.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But I allowed myself to
feel the anger so rawly

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.820 align:middle line:90%
for three days, Emma.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:90%
I just let it out unabashedly.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.970 align:middle line:84%
After three days, the
weight lifted off my heart.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And I like to think.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
You know the "Footprints
in the Sand" poem?

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> When you only see
one footprint, not two?

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
God carried me through
those three days.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
He understood that I
needed to go through that.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
healing process.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to feel the
anger and let it out.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But then, we can come
back to a balance

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.393 align:middle line:84%
again and find
our way back home.

00:38:35.393 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Barbara, I just knew you'd be
the perfect expert to help Emma

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%

of harmony better.

I am so excited for her to
share her message with you.

00:38:57.498 --> 00:38:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and have a seat.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.695 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:59.695 --> 00:39:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Emma, I understand that
you've had a similar situation

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that I have, that you've just
recently gone through a really

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.930 align:middle line:90%
hard divorce.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
That is what I've
gone through, too.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I've had a couple of
spiritual awakenings

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that helped me to see how
to change from one thing

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It was really two
different times in my life.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
being a divorce that

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:90%
came at an inopportune time.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Really helps me to
understand the key of empathy

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and really feel for what
you're going through.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Everything was good for
me for a couple years,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.530 align:middle line:90%
until I had my daughter.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Once she was born, everything
changed in my life.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I was used to having a great
relationship with the man

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:90%
that I love so much.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But then after I
became a mom, that's

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the only way that he saw me.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:84%
We changed from
being great friends,

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
doing things together,
and having a great life

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:90%
to just being simply a mom.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was so unexpected for me.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I really didn't know what to do.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So I actually kept
trying harder and harder.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I felt rejected, I
just felt smaller and smaller.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
My whole life as I knew it
really felt like it was over.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I tried to seek approval and
get what I was used to having.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But I had to take care
of my daughter, too.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.430 align:middle line:90%
I had a career at the same time.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So as I did both,
that part of me

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that just felt dejected just
sort of got shoved down.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't really
much I could do about it.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Except one day, there
was a turn of events.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It does get better.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I went to a whole life expo
where I didn't even really know

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.560 align:middle line:90%
what was calling me there.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But I felt like
there was something

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.210 align:middle line:90%
that I had to know about.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.030 align:middle line:90%
It kind of came out of the blue.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And once I was there,
I went to a lecture.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And I found a meta
physician, a spiritual man,

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:84%
where I listened to his lecture,
and I became so enthralled

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:84%
in something that I really
didn't know anything about.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I started asking questions.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really even
know what I was saying,

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.920 align:middle line:84%
but I knew I was becoming
passionate about something

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.570 align:middle line:90%
wonderful.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was really the
field of metaphysics--

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:90%
that and quantum physics.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I was a housewife
and a real estate agent.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It hit me out of the blue.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to talk
to him after the lecture,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I think he was
reading my energy.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:84%
He said would you like
to come over, and let's

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.610 align:middle line:90%
talk a little bit?

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.390 align:middle line:90%
So I sat down with him.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:90%
We had a cup of coffee.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, he did an
energy healing on me.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Emma, it was just
out of this world.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I'd never had one before.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.456 align:middle line:90%
>> I got chills.

00:42:02.456 --> 00:42:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So one day, I
took the courage.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And I stepped into it.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And not only did I get divorced,
but I changed my careers

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and stepped into healing.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.383 align:middle line:84%
>> You do understand
what I've been through.

00:42:16.383 --> 00:42:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I think I do.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So much change.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> My dear, everything
will turn out right.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Because once you step
into what you truly love,

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:90%
everything good will happen.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.673 align:middle line:90%
Just take that leap.

00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:33.511 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:33.511 --> 00:42:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Emma, I am so excited to
introduce you to this next

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:90%
expert, Steve Roger Phillips.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He's going to join
us in just a second.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
He is a former monk and former
international rugby player.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I bet you didn't have
that on your list.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's a mouthful!

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Here he is now.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Emma.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm Steve.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi!

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:90%
So nice to meet you.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.627 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you, too.

00:42:56.627 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you so much for coming
so far to help us with Emma

00:42:59.420 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an absolute pleasure.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.627 align:middle line:90%
>> So good to see you.

00:43:01.627 --> 00:43:04.654 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.654 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emma.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So I understand that
you've been going

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:84%
through some difficulties,
and you've lost

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:90%
somebody really close to you.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I also lost somebody
close to me when I was 13.

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It was my dad, and it was a
very traumatic time in my life.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was just 13
years old, and I

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
started asking all the
important questions in life.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:90%
What's the goal of life?

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And where do we go when we die?

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.270 align:middle line:84%
After that, I started getting
into addictions, alcohol,

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.620 align:middle line:90%
many other things.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.720 align:middle line:90%
And I got severely depressed.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I tried taking my life
on three occasions.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But thankfully, I
was unsuccessful.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Two years later, my mom that's
always been there for me--

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.760 align:middle line:84%
she's amazing--
met somebody new.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
He came into my room, and
he said what do you want?

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.356 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:43:54.356 --> 00:43:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Blew me away.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want to be an
international rugby player.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So I set some goals,
and I attained them.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I earned my Welsh Cup in Rugby.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But I was still struggling
in many areas of my life.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So a few years
later, I find myself

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.170 align:middle line:84%
in insurance sales
going door to door.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to learn
body language in sales.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I was earning a load of
money, but I wasn't satisfied.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't happy within my heart.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't healthy.

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:29.817 align:middle line:84%
So I had a meeting with
my regional manager.

00:44:29.817 --> 00:44:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I sat down with him.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:84%
He's an ex semi-professional
football player.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I told him that I
was going to heal people.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me as
if I had two heads.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And even though he was telling
me I had the world at my feet,

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.507 align:middle line:84%
I had such a future,
it wasn't integral.

00:44:46.507 --> 00:44:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't right in my heart.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So I said thank
you so much, John.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate it,
but I need to leave.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.250 align:middle line:90%
So I walked out.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking
up, when I walked out,

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and thanking God because
it was such a relief.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So after that, I started
studying metaphysics

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and all the healing arts.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Meditation, et cetera.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:09.908 align:middle line:84%
And I was so fulfilled,
deeply fulfilled in my heart.

00:45:09.908 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't earning the
money that I was earning

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:12.992 align:middle line:90%
from the insurance sales.

00:45:12.992 --> 00:45:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And soon enough, money
started running out.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I started to get into
debt, a lot of debt.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I felt really alone.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
tough time in my life.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.390 align:middle line:84%
However there was a
really big contrast,

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:29.220 align:middle line:84%
because I was also really
deeply fulfilled, spiritually.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't long after
that I was in the shower.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't picture it.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.378 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:36.378 --> 00:45:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the shower.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I've got tears
dripping down my face.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I am praying, really
sincerely praying to God.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:44.247 align:middle line:90%
Show me the truth.

00:45:44.247 --> 00:45:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I know there's more.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Show me the truth.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And just two weeks later,
I'm at a health convention.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:55.610 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine says the
Hare Krishnas have got

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.920 align:middle line:90%
the answers you're looking for.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I went over, delved
into the philosophy,

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.220 align:middle line:90%
and it just blew me away.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything resonated
within my heart,

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt
like I'd come home.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:10%
Especially the mantra--

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.580 align:middle line:10%
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare,
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Hare Hare.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It was so beautiful.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Still is beautiful.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:84%
After two years serving
as a celibate monk,

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I left the temple because
I had a chronic health

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.760 align:middle line:84%
condition called hyper
electrosensitivity.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was sensitive to EMFs,
electromagnetic frequencies, et

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to
see a naturopath.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So all the signs were pointing
in the direction of Emma,

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.180 align:middle line:84%
funny enough, who
is now my wife.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Another similar time, I got
diagnosed with infertility.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I'd have
children in this life.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Emma did such a
good job, we've now

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.290 align:middle line:90%
got two beautiful daughters.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.607 align:middle line:84%
And we've got another
baby on the way.

00:46:53.607 --> 00:46:54.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Congratulations.

00:46:54.581 --> 00:46:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a miracle.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.415 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason I'm sharing
this with you, Emma,

00:47:00.415 --> 00:47:01.540 align:middle line:90%
it's not to share my story.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah OK, that's my story.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But it more so is to
share the key of faith.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, I've had so
much faith throughout my life.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:14.240 align:middle line:84%
God the divine has
always been there for me,

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.161 align:middle line:84%
in the toughest of times
more so than at any time.

00:47:18.161 --> 00:47:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Emma.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emma.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.000 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Emma, this is Jim Philips.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.050 align:middle line:10%
>> So nice to meet you.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:22.234 align:middle line:10%
>> Pleasure to meet you.

00:47:22.234 --> 00:47:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:22.880 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm doing well, thank you.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.716 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat, please.

00:47:25.716 --> 00:47:27.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Looks like
you're busy working.

00:47:27.615 --> 00:47:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm working on another book.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about it.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of the
things that perhaps I'm

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.510 align:middle line:84%
going to be sharing in this
book might be able to help you.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've been going
through a very difficult time,

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps still are going
through some of the things

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.710 align:middle line:90%
that you've been experiencing.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'd really like to
ask you, how are you

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.815 align:middle line:90%
feeling about all this?

00:47:46.815 --> 00:47:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I am just a
little overwhelmed,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.090 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has
been one of the most

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.410 align:middle line:84%
incredible and unbelievable
days of my life.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:48:00.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not often that
you are guided by two

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:90%
beautiful guardian angels.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I have really
been going through some very

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.110 align:middle line:90%
difficult times.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And something that
I haven't really

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:84%
addressed yet with the experts
was the loss of my friend.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's been really
hard for me to deal with.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Her death was so sudden,
and I don't really

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:25.100 align:middle line:90%
know how to process it.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But I want you to
think about something.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:84%
You've been through all
of these situations--

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.910 align:middle line:84%
your divorce, your
friend passing.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Here you are.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.790 align:middle line:90%
You've overcome all of them.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.290 align:middle line:84%
You've had the
confidence to do what

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:41.060 align:middle line:84%
was necessary in the
midst of whatever it

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.690 align:middle line:90%
was you were faced with.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And here's something else
that I can assure you,

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and that is that you will
never be given anything

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can't do, because
there isn't anything

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:51.890 align:middle line:90%
that you can't do.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.223 align:middle line:90%
And you need to understand that.

00:48:53.223 --> 00:48:54.470 align:middle line:90%
You need to tap into that.

00:48:54.470 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Every time we are given a
challenging opportunity,

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:84%
we're being given an opportunity
to tap into ourselves,

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.800 align:middle line:90%
to stretch.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Not to become more
of who we are,

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.530 align:middle line:84%
but to allow who we
are to be expressed.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:12.640 align:middle line:90%
We're already complete.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But we're allowing that which
we already are to come out

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.873 align:middle line:84%
and to be the expression
that we have in the world.

00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's really how
we benefit other people.

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.120 align:middle line:90%
It's through our expression.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not about necessarily
going out and doing something

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.070 align:middle line:90%
specifically for somebody.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.870 align:middle line:84%
By you being who you are, by
you being joyful, happy, by you

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.953 align:middle line:84%
getting into coaching or
any of the other pursuits

00:49:33.953 --> 00:49:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that you might want to have,
anything that you might

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.560 align:middle line:84%
be passionate about,
you're giving other people

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.300 align:middle line:90%
permission to do the same.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
fears that we all have

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.722 align:middle line:84%
is that someone
will say something

00:49:43.722 --> 00:49:44.680 align:middle line:90%
about what we're doing.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.810 align:middle line:84%
They'll laugh,
they'll joke, they'll

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.800 align:middle line:90%
question why we're doing it.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.330 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it's not about them.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about you and
what you want to do.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The only opinion that matters
about you is your own.

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you go through the
rest of your life recognizing

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that this
is about you being you--

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.720 align:middle line:84%
about you being fully,
completely, and wholly Emma--

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.435 align:middle line:84%
not allowing anybody else to
say that you can't do something,

00:50:07.435 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:90%
or you should do something.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.358 align:middle line:84%
This is about you doing
and being who you are.

00:50:11.358 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And that allows you to
be this bright light

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:14.317 align:middle line:90%
that you say you want to be.

00:50:14.317 --> 00:50:16.900 align:middle line:84%
That allows you to have that
inner peace and that calm,

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.060 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what's
been put in front of you.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to overcome it,
because that's who you are.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And I have faith in you.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:50:25.265 --> 00:50:27.572 align:middle line:84%

have that same faith.

you here with a few minutes

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:44.680 align:middle line:10%

your take on how the spiritual

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.375 align:middle line:10%
and the physical interact.

00:50:46.375 --> 00:50:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Life touch matter
and moves matter.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.020 align:middle line:90%
We can call it also incarnation.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's working for
billions of years.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The first creation, of
course, we know is light.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.100 align:middle line:90%
It move the quantums.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.530 align:middle line:84%
This is manifestations
of matter.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
everything is created.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.336 align:middle line:84%
And it goes so many
different directions.

00:51:09.336 --> 00:51:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Stuff manifests in
all the directions,

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:14.250 align:middle line:90%
particularly care for right now.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:18.490 align:middle line:84%
The creation of humanity is
the result of billions of years

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that life is working in
matter, processing, evolving.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:27.157 align:middle line:84%
Until matter becomes
very receptable to light,

00:51:27.157 --> 00:51:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and now we're talking
about the human brain.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Matter reflects
light, reflects life.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reflection, what we
create is virtual reality.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.910 align:middle line:90%
We call it mind.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Then the mind is virtual.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.805 align:middle line:90%
But it's wonderful.

00:51:45.805 --> 00:51:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when you look at the
spiritual nature of matter,

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:51.580 align:middle line:90%
you can't see it.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not matter.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.560 align:middle line:10%
The spiritual or the
ethereal energy that moves

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.890 align:middle line:10%
forth is based on
what emotional issue

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:10%
you derived from what
you thought about

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:03.520 align:middle line:10%
was happening to you.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Without putting those into
play, you give ethereal energy

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.200 align:middle line:84%
no way to interact
in a positive healing

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.940 align:middle line:90%
point with the physical matter.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.190 align:middle line:90%
But also remember this.

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:17.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the greatest part
about the spiritual nature.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The simple fact that
the placebo effect

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.175 align:middle line:84%
is 50% of the success rate
of any drug or any therapy.

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:25.975 align:middle line:90%
>> At least.

00:52:25.975 --> 00:52:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Half of what you believe
is what you believe.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.820 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it says,
half of what you believe

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.370 align:middle line:90%
is half of what you believe.

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi!

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Emma, I'm introducing
you to Cammie Ritchie,

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.228 align:middle line:90%
a transformational life coach.

00:52:41.228 --> 00:52:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> So nice to meet you, Cammie.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:43.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Have a seat.

00:52:43.695 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> My heart feels for you,
because I've been there.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I remember crawled up in a
ball, bawling my eyes out,

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.700 align:middle line:84%
because a very dysfunctional
road had led me

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to a very abusive marriage.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:84%
That's when I realized I
either had to pack it in,

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.840 align:middle line:84%
or I had to make some
major changes in my life.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after I escaped from
my very abusive relationship,

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having a rash
on my arms and my chest.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.970 align:middle line:84%
An A new doctor had
come into the area,

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and I had decided to go and see
him-- a 10 minute appointment

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to see what I could
do with this rash.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, Emma, if
you've heard of this.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But our biography
turns into our biology.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.900 align:middle line:10%
Or the other way
around it is our issues

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:10%
show up in our tissues.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.230 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I've never heard that.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what that means is
our emotions end up manifesting

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.680 align:middle line:90%
into our physical symptoms.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the rash was about!

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:50.530 align:middle line:84%
However for the first time,
somebody was willing to listen.

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Not just hear about my story,
but listen to my story,

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.080 align:middle line:90%
believe me.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And for two hours, I realized
that what I had asked for,

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.370 align:middle line:84%
which was help, was
sitting in front of me.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:12.410 align:middle line:10%
That doctor, with my permission,
set me up and admitted me

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:10%
into a live in program
for adult children

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.270 align:middle line:10%
of alcoholics and codependency.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of my transformation.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And because I started to
understand what self-worth was,

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.360 align:middle line:90%
self-love, self care--

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and how to get there is simply
by understanding and letting

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.640 align:middle line:90%
your true self come out.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:90%
And I saw how I transformed.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I then became a
transformational coach,

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:53.500 align:middle line:84%
because I want people to live
fully and abundantly like I do.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So I have four easy steps
that I teach my clients.

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is when you
are in a negative situation--

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe a damaging,
dangerous situation--

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:08.020 align:middle line:90%
number one, stop.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Be still.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Quiet your mind and
really get in honest

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.200 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, in deep,
honestly with yourself,

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and find out why are
you feeling this way.

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:23.480 align:middle line:90%
What's making you feel this way?

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.510 align:middle line:84%
What isn't working, and
what needs to be changed?

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The second step is to
seek and find the truth.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So while you're sitting
in that quiet time,

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that stillness,
whatever comes up,

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.700 align:middle line:84%
let it come up because
it's there to help you.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes, that's so scary.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very scary.

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Because not only does
good stuff come up,

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:50.960 align:middle line:84%
but we also see
our uglies come up.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Our issues.

00:55:53.005 --> 00:55:54.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Our issues!

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The third step I would
suggest for you is then

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.720 align:middle line:90%
accept what comes up.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth step
is the big one,

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:09.850 align:middle line:84%
because once you understand
what it is you're feeling,

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:84%
you now are
realizing whatever it

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.040 align:middle line:84%
was that you
repressing, suppressing,

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.390 align:middle line:90%
denying, resisting.

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know that there's
an issue there that you

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.440 align:middle line:90%
need to clear up and change.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.800 align:middle line:10%
You bring it up,
and now take action

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:10%
to change yourself
for the better.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:30.280 align:middle line:10%
That takes
compassion, self-love,

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.480 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of bravery.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.600 align:middle line:84%
However once you do that,
I'm going to tell you

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.250 align:middle line:90%
that's your freedom.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
free, that brings us

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.760 align:middle line:90%
into living life passionately.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Elizabeth,
for bringing Emma to me.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Emma, are you ready to
embrace the key of passion?

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Fabulous!

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a real treat
for you next, Emma.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you?

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Vitale,
so good to see.

00:56:58.616 --> 00:56:59.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello!

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so excited to
introduce you to Emma.

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Emma, this is Dr. Joe Vitale.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emma.

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:04.690 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And he is an expert on
the key of appreciation.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.536 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited to have him
share his story with you.

00:57:12.536 --> 00:57:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And how are you
feeling at the moment?

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have anything
to be grateful for.

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I can definitely
relate to that.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you open to a
story that may help?

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:27.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you may not know, but
at one point in my life I was

00:57:27.458 --> 00:57:28.610 align:middle line:90%
homeless.

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was in poverty
for over 10 years.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.917 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's
like to struggle.

00:57:32.917 --> 00:57:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's like to
go through the dark night

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.580 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's
like to have agony.

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's
like to burn inside,

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.960 align:middle line:90%
because it hurts so bad.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was hearing about
the key of appreciation,

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:48.107 align:middle line:90%
the attitude of gratitude.

00:57:48.107 --> 00:57:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking
oh, I'll be grateful

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:53.000 align:middle line:84%
when I have something
to be grateful for.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I remember thinking that.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But everywhere I looked, all
the books, all the courses

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.180 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
gratitude as being

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.670 align:middle line:90%
this key, this appreciation.

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And I remember flippantly--

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't believing it--

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.160 align:middle line:90%
reaching for a pencil.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And this story has
become so profound,

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.900 align:middle line:84%
it shouldn't surprise you
that I carry a pencil now.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.940 align:middle line:90%
And so, I have a pencil.

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
picking up a pencil.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And you got to remember,
this is the time

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.580 align:middle line:90%
of the dark night of the soul.

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.525 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
around me that I'm ever

00:58:21.525 --> 00:58:22.400 align:middle line:90%
going to be anything.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.270 align:middle line:90%
I am broke.

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.380 align:middle line:90%
I am unknown.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I am unpublished.

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:27.073 align:middle line:90%
I am unhappy.

00:58:27.073 --> 00:58:28.240 align:middle line:90%
You can relate to all of it.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I can.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And I thought, OK.

00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to practice gratitude.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Not believing it, I
picked up a pencil.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.605 align:middle line:84%
I said OK, I'm going to be
grateful for this pencil.

00:58:36.605 --> 00:58:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the
pencil and said yeah,

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.950 align:middle line:84%
with this pencil I can
write a suicide note.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I can write a grocery list.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I can write some sort
of stupid lyrics.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I can write some
complaint letter.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, as I was playing--

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:49.950 align:middle line:90%
because I was skeptical.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:51.170 align:middle line:90%
I was bitter.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize I could
write the great American novel.

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I could write hit songs.

00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I can write love letters.

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I can write a manifesto
that changes the world.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Every time I tell the
story, my energy changes.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Every time!

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, back
in that moment

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.350 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
changing around me.

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this hellhole that
I can't even pay for.

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at this stick
with a piece of lead going,

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I can change the
world with this.

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel grateful,
and I turned it around.

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said who
invented the eraser?

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.120 align:middle line:90%
How brilliant is this?

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.700 align:middle line:84%
With the eraser, I can
erase that suicide note.

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I can correct my grocery list.

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.060 align:middle line:90%
I can fix the poem.

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I can do whatever it is.

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
this is a miracle!

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.570 align:middle line:90%
This is a miracle.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.900 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment,
my life changed.

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.720 align:middle line:84%
The pencil just
happened to be there.

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I picked up anything.

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:51.710 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I
learned gratitude.

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I learned that it
raised my vibration

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:55.760 align:middle line:90%
to start appreciating things.

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I started to look
at the same world

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that I looked at, the world
that when I looked out

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.760 align:middle line:84%
there was dark,
and it was gloomy,

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and there was no opportunity.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no choices,
certainly nothing for me.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.855 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where
I've been living!

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> The pencil changed it.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.760 align:middle line:84%
After the pencil
experience, I looked out.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
see opportunities.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I started to see ideas.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.070 align:middle line:90%
They were there the whole time.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The window opened in my
soul, and my very first book

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
"Zen and the Art of Writing"
came to me as an idea.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.415 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

01:00:24.415 --> 01:00:25.570 align:middle line:90%
It came from the ethers.

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.480 align:middle line:90%
It came from the sky.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It came from the divine,
whatever you want to call it.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was published in
1984, my very first book "Zen

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and the Art of Writing."

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Turning point in my
life, because here I

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
had been a struggling author.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the moment
of truth, I am published.

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was also the dark
night of the soul again,

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%
because I realized publishers
don't know anything

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:47.820 align:middle line:90%
about marketing books.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So I found that I
could learn marketing.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I learned marketing 1984, 1985,
which changed my path of life

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.080 align:middle line:90%
forever.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I have since written
almost 100 books.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Even I am baffled.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Like how does somebody
write 100 books?

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Get a good pencil.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.163 align:middle line:90%
>> With that pencil, yeah!

01:01:08.163 --> 01:01:08.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:11.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Get a good pencil, and
you can write 100 some books.

01:01:11.282 --> 01:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole point is back then
when I picked up the pencil,

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.100 align:middle line:90%
broke and unknown.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.322 align:middle line:84%
Because of the pencil,
I now live the lifestyle

01:01:18.322 --> 01:01:19.280 align:middle line:90%
of the rich and famous.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.167 align:middle line:84%
And I get to do wonderful
things like make

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:22.250 align:middle line:90%
a difference in your life.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So I just have one question.

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Are you married?

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm single now.

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:30.260 align:middle line:90%


01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm just asking.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
change my vibration.

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you're doing very good.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You're changing my
vibration, that's

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
for sure, with these quite
complimentary questions.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Here's the whole point.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I want you to get.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to find what you
are grateful for, what you

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.065 align:middle line:90%
appreciate in this moment now.

01:01:48.065 --> 01:01:48.865 align:middle line:90%
>> All right!

01:01:48.865 --> 01:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You are given so much
that you cannot out give

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:53.740 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you say that again?

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You cannot out
give the universe.

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand that
your mind is working right now.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Your body is working right now.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.050 align:middle line:90%
You are breathing.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You are not making
any of this happen.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.448 align:middle line:90%
The universe is giving you air.

01:02:08.448 --> 01:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
It is giving you gravity so you
don't float out of your chair

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and go somewhere else.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:16.853 align:middle line:84%
All of this is happening
for your best interest.

01:02:16.853 --> 01:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
When you first came in the
door, and you're coming in here

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.312 align:middle line:84%
and saying that you're
going through this misery,

01:02:21.312 --> 01:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
it is hard to open that
window of appreciation

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.990 align:middle line:90%
and raise your vibration.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:28.390 align:middle line:90%
But all it takes is the pencil.

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And when I did it,
I was flippant.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.480 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe it.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.560 align:middle line:90%
But now I know.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Pick anything in your life, on
the desk, in the buffet of life

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:38.560 align:middle line:90%
that is presented to you.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Find something you
are grateful for.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Focus on that.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It will expand
everything within you.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
You will change your vibration.

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You will move into the
key of appreciation,

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and your life will
change forever.

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Emma, I hope Dr. Joe has got
your wheels turning so that you

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
can start thinking about
all you have to be grateful

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
for in your life.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Your pencil.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I have so much more to be
grateful than I ever realized.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> You just don't see it.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I wanted
you to meet Dr. Joe.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew his
story about the pencil,

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that it would
inspire you to see how much

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
you have for which
to be grateful.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:17.140 align:middle line:90%
You really can get past this.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.240 align:middle line:90%
I know you will.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I know I can now.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder Dr. Joe,
can I have the pencil?

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You can have this for
$1,000-- no, I'm only kidding.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:26.890 align:middle line:90%
You can have the pencil.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> All right!

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Are you grateful for the pencil?

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm very grateful.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> You appreciate the pencil?

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I appreciate the pencil.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you notice that
your vibe just went up?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> See how easy it is?

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
You've already changed
your vibration just

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
within the minutes
that we've been here.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The magical pencil.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, you have a magic
pencil to be with you at all

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.380 align:middle line:90%
times.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:43.332 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dr. Joe.

01:03:43.332 --> 01:03:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Godspeed to you.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:03:52.294 --> 01:03:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Emma, this is Shannon Knight.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Have a seat on the
step if you want.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So nice to meet you.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emma.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Very nice to meet you.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Emma's been going through
a very challenging time.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emma.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so sorry about the
loss of your friend, really.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's always an honor
when someone wants to hear about

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
anything that I've gone through,

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And to speak to you
about the key of courage,

I hope that it's
going to help you.

When I had stage 3 breast
cancer and went ahead

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and agreed to the
bilateral mastectomy,

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what I was in for.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't really give
you all the details.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You just think that
you're going in,

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.483 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing
something that you've

01:04:37.483 --> 01:04:39.110 align:middle line:90%
heard a lot of other women do.

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
telling the story.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:44.248 align:middle line:84%
When I went in, I
was comfortable.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was a little nervous.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But I thought well,
they'll fix everything.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up, I had no idea
what I was going to be facing.

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
First of all, I was alone.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:54.780 align:middle line:90%
No one was in the room.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I had this hot
feeling on my chest,

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
like someone had put
a hot shovel on me.

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then when I looked
down, everything was flat.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So emotionally,
it was hitting me.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm alone, no one's here.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And there were four
drains coming out

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:17.000 align:middle line:90%
filled with dark, dark fluid.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.540 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
When the doctor finally came
in, he says what's going on?

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.225 align:middle line:84%
And I could barely breathe
the pain was so hot.

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said I'm in pain.

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:28.830 align:middle line:90%
He goes where?

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Very abrupt.

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
After they got rid of the
pain, why are you still crying?

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I said because I'm scared.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's here.

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm all alone.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect any of this.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And I could not stop crying.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
As a woman who's not married,
I thought oh, my gosh.

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
No man's ever going
to want me like this.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.150 align:middle line:90%
This is not what I thought.

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
How am I ever going to look like
a woman up on my chest again?

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They took everything clear
down through the nerves,

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
down to get a clear margin
down to my rib cage.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they did do plastic
surgery, it was a choice.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Did I want to go through
extreme pain of them pulling

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
the nerves off of
the rib cage just

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
so I could feel if I bumped
into a door or something?

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding you.

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:16.850 align:middle line:90%
That was the reason why.

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:19.260 align:middle line:90%
So you'd either be numb or feel.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
feel again, they're

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
going to have to pull the
nerves off the rib cage

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and expand them out
slowly over time.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't see where that goodness
and where that change is

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:30.720 align:middle line:90%
going to come from.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But you hold on, knowing
that it's going to come.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.880 align:middle line:90%
And then, you just wait.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.340 align:middle line:90%
But meanwhile, do things.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Write in a gratitude journal.

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Become grateful at this time
for the things that you do have,

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
that you can see and touch.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
That's going to multiply
your abundance in life.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And the grieving for
the loss of a loved one?

01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:54.690 align:middle line:90%
That's normal.

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to go
through that for a long time.

01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The healing sometimes
is agonizingly slow,

01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:02.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's going to come.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You are such an inspiration.

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I will have the key of courage.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That key is going to be
something that you are going

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
to use over and over again
and help other people with.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're such a great
example of what you can do with

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:17.980 align:middle line:90%
the key of courage.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think Emma could

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
use a little shot of courage
right now-- with everything

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:22.260 align:middle line:90%
you've been through, darling?

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So I really wanted
her to meet you.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
sharing your story, darling.

01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You are so welcome.

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.072 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever need
me, you can find me.

01:07:31.072 --> 01:07:31.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:31.872 --> 01:07:33.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Angels for Shannon.

01:07:33.043 --> 01:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Angels for Shannon.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.530 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm at online.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you so much.

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for blessing
me with your presence.

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You've blessed me, because
you've brought me back to what

01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I've gone through.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And every time we
get to look back

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
at what we've been through
to help someone else,

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.760 align:middle line:84%
we get to go into a
place of gratitude

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.430 align:middle line:90%
of where we are today.

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Doug.

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Elizabeth.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.458 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to
introduce you to Emma.

01:07:53.458 --> 01:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.407 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Doug Smith.

01:07:55.407 --> 01:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
believe his story.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure to meet you.

01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:58.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:58.536 --> 01:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:02.320 align:middle line:90%
A little bit about my story--

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.690 align:middle line:84%
when I was born and
learned how to walk,

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I was put into ankle to
hip leg braces as a child,

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.400 align:middle line:90%
like Forrest Gump braces.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
All the way from the
ankle to the hip.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.692 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't
a doctor anywhere

01:08:13.692 --> 01:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that would have said
I would have made it

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to the National Hockey
League by the time I was 18.

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:19.747 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And so my mother helped
me get through that period

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time I
was 18, I was playing

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.779 align:middle line:90%
in the National Hockey League.

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then at age 29,
I had an accident.

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I went full speed, headfirst
into the end boards.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And I shattered the fifth
and sixth cervical vertebrae

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.660 align:middle line:90%
in my neck.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that resulted in me
becoming a quadriplegic.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And and I changed the
instant I hit the boards.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
The instant I hit the boards,
I realized all the times

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
in my life that I had treated
people inappropriately,

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.939 align:middle line:84%
where I'd pushed
people out of the way

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:59.859 align:middle line:84%
when I could've
been a lot nicer.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I had to change,
and empathy would be the key.

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:06.819 align:middle line:84%
It would be the
key to me changing.

01:09:06.819 --> 01:09:08.529 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did
was over the years,

01:09:08.529 --> 01:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I documented the process of my
recovery to get walking again

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and to deal with the trauma.

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:16.689 align:middle line:90%
And I developed a system.

01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And the system is
called system 438.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.979 align:middle line:90%
And here's how it works.

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:23.229 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with
the four types of trauma?

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> No, please tell me.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.343 align:middle line:90%
>> This is so fascinating.

01:09:26.343 --> 01:09:28.779 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are only four,
and there's only one that we

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:29.750 align:middle line:90%
can't see.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
ticking time bomb.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But my system works
for all four types.

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But here's the four
types of trauma.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.109 align:middle line:84%
Number one,
catastrophic physical--

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:39.880 align:middle line:90%
we all know what that is.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.859 align:middle line:84%
Catastrophic emotional
is number two.

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:44.710 align:middle line:90%
You can't avoid that.

01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Cumulative physical trauma
is the third type of trauma.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.729 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
We know it's bad to hit
your head over and over,

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes we don't see the
symptoms until it's too late.

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.310 align:middle line:10%
And then, there's the
fourth type of trauma--

01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:00.560 align:middle line:10%
cumulative emotional trauma.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the ticking time
bomb, because we can't see it.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
We can't smell it.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like carbon
monoxide to our brain.

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to understand
those four types of trauma,

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to have the awareness that
there are four types of trauma.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And how you deal with the
trauma, how you break it

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
down and break
down the disruption

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
it causes in our brain
between the conscious

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and subconscious
is by understanding

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the three priorities of
the subconscious brain.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the subconscious
brain, it controls us.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It's 97% of our
human functioning.

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
improve your performance,

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
you must understand what
it craves, what it needs.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know where an 800
pound gorilla sits when

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.430 align:middle line:90%
it comes in the room, right?

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Anywhere it wants.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you lose control of that
subconscious brain because

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of trauma, you'll
start behaving in ways,

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.650 align:middle line:90%
and you won't know why.

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:52.730 align:middle line:90%
You'll be helpless to it.

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
The system to break that
down is the three priorities

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and the eight behaviors
that we can cultivate

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
to feed those three priorities.

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So the three priorities
are meeting basic needs.

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
A roof over your
head, warmth-- you

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
have to make sure that
your subconscious brain has

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:12.000 align:middle line:90%
those basic needs met.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.270 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
clarity of thought.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious
craves clarity of thought.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The type of clarity that you
get from yoga, from meditation--

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the scientific
evidence is piling up.

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:27.530 align:middle line:90%
It works.

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And the third
priority is so simple.

01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
The third priority is
helping other people.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And those are the only
things the subconscious

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.120 align:middle line:90%
brain cares about.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.310 align:middle line:90%
So the eight behaviors--

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
belief in self, motivation,
focus and trust,

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
awareness, asking for help,
emotional control, and purpose.

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They feed the three priorities
of the subconscious brain,

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
which is meeting basic
needs, clarity of thought,

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%
and helping other people.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I hope that helps, Emma.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I hope that will take
you on a better path

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
so that you can just
work on getting better.

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So that you can work on empathy
like I had to develop it.

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I had to become empathetic.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to be empathetic.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I was designed to
destroy weakness.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And today, I've learned
that it's my responsibility

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.730 align:middle line:90%
to prop up weakness.

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're able to see
weakness in other people,

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.180 align:middle line:90%
don't crush it.

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:26.222 align:middle line:84%
I was taught to
crush it as a child.

01:12:26.222 --> 01:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I broke
my neck, I learned

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to
give it a crutch

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to support it for
a little bit so

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:32.120 align:middle line:90%
that person could get stronger.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that
for other people,

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
if you share this
with other people,

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.920 align:middle line:84%
then you're helping
other people.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's a priority of
the subconscious brain.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.355 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing.

01:12:42.355 --> 01:12:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I am so deeply moved by
your courage and the beautiful

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and inspiring relationship
that you had with your mother.

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.917 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just my mother.

01:12:53.917 --> 01:12:55.500 align:middle line:10%
Women have been a
big part of my life.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I have two daughters.

01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And without my wife--

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.460 align:middle line:90%
we've been married 31 years.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.812 align:middle line:90%


01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Patti's my hero.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm wondering about
very highly successful,

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
high achieving, seemingly
successful individuals spinning

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:middle line:90%
in self sabotage.

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.435 align:middle line:84%
How could I best help
them and serve them?

01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Each one of those
is separate cases.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
As Miguel would say,
everybody's their own artist.

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think there's
an open, all general way

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that you could look at
to transform that group

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:33.310 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:34.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Unless people learn
to identify with you.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And in identifying
with you, they

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
can maybe begin the
process of releasing it.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no other way, because
everybody's different.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:44.880 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
suicide and self sabotage,

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to think
about it in terms

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
of the choices that
would have been mitigated

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.170 align:middle line:90%
for that to have happened.

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
How many completely
different possibilities

01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:02.310 align:middle line:84%
could have occurred
from a tweet to you're

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:03.410 align:middle line:90%
threatening your life?

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:06.825 align:middle line:84%
And so I think you have to
look at each case individually.

01:14:06.825 --> 01:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The main problem is
that they try so hard.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
know they're trying.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.625 align:middle line:84%
They try, and they see that
something is not working.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
They get a little frustrated.

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
They just judge themselves.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Why do you have to do that?

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You know,
everything is just fun.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Why try?

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Try to be myself.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Why should I try?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.615 align:middle line:90%
I am myself.

01:14:31.615 --> 01:14:32.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:14:32.415 --> 01:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> There's nothing to try.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:37.950 align:middle line:10%
You see, there's many
people who die trying.

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:38.970 align:middle line:90%
It's true!

01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:40.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I got it.

01:14:40.196 --> 01:14:41.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like him.

01:14:41.188 --> 01:14:42.708 align:middle line:90%
He try and boom.

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I finally am a victim again.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It was twice, not only once.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It was twice.

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I had it coming.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a healer of healers, and
I'd like to go out and touch

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.600 align:middle line:90%
a million lives.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.670 align:middle line:10%
What words of wisdom
would you give me

01:14:56.670 --> 01:15:00.420 align:middle line:10%
as I'm on my journey to work
with the key of passion, that's

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.360 align:middle line:10%
actually my key that
I've been working with,

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.090 align:middle line:10%
and the key of
empathy to support

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:08.927 align:middle line:10%
people find their healing
from the inside out?

01:15:08.927 --> 01:15:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>> You're going to have
to really approach it from

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:15.450 align:middle line:10%
a deeply personal, spiritual
point of view to touch that

01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:19.950 align:middle line:10%
level of consciousness
that guides you to be able

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:23.100 align:middle line:10%
to consciously allow people
to know that they're healers,

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.680 align:middle line:10%
because that's why
you're present,

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.030 align:middle line:10%
and not get in the ego's way.

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And then, consciously
inspire them

01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:32.490 align:middle line:10%
to do the same for others that
you are now doing for them.

01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:35.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's still held from
a very deeply connected,

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.570 align:middle line:90%
personal place.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> This is ML Blay-Miezah.

01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Emma.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Like she said, my name is ML.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Mona Lisa is what it stands for.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I arrived in America
on August 16, 1997

01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
as a teenager on
full scholarship

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.080 align:middle line:90%
to my undergraduate college.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I married in sophomore year.

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I was a junior,
I had a daughter named Skye.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I still graduated
on time, because I

01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:02.880 align:middle line:84%
had to stay in school
as an F1 visa student.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So when I graduated, I
went on to get an MBA.

01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The original plan
was to be a lawyer.

01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But because it takes
three years to do law,

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I did my master's degree.

01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I have an MBA in marketing
management and brand.

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And had my son in
my MBA program.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I was about
26, I had the perfect family,

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.865 align:middle line:90%
picket fence.

01:16:20.865 --> 01:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I had two children in
two, a boy and a girl--

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Skye and Rain.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the world was
just unraveling before me.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
However, with my six figure
salary job at General Electric

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I was a 6 Sigma statistics
black belt marketing manager.

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And the statistics was
overwhelming for me.

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:39.880 align:middle line:84%
As experienced as
I thought I was,

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't handle what
it took to do that.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So I began to feel depressed,
didn't want to go to work.

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And with no income, I couldn't
pay for the so-called mansion

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.580 align:middle line:90%
that I had purchased.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And on 6th of June, 2006
they threw all my stuff

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
in the mansion on my
lawn in my neighborhood.

01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.240 align:middle line:10%
And when that happened,
my six-year-old Skye

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.830 align:middle line:10%
and 3-year-old Rain
picked up only pictures.

01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we had nowhere
to turn and nowhere

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.080 align:middle line:84%
to put the furniture
on the lawn.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So we picked up the
pictures, and we

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.800 align:middle line:90%
proceeded to sleep in the car.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So my mom came for them.

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
going to flip a coin.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So I did a one way
trip to New York.

01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I went straight from JFK to
the Jamaica Queens shelter.

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm a single mom with
no kids, so I need a bed.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.110 align:middle line:90%
They gave me a bed.

01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:27.570 align:middle line:84%
In that shelter
Jamaica, Queens--

01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 190th street--

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.550 align:middle line:84%
there was a library right in
Queens I'd go to every morning.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%
I wake up at 4:30.

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:34.870 align:middle line:90%
By 9:00, I'm out.

01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm acting
like I have a job.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So 9:00 to 5:00, I
stay in the library.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to read all
these self-help books,

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:42.840 align:middle line:90%
motivational books.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I put the pay phone of
the shelter on my resume

01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and began to pray that my
resume that I was fixing up

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.980 align:middle line:90%
as a marketer was amazing.

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.480 align:middle line:10%
I said if they just
see this resume,

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.580 align:middle line:10%
they're going to
call me for a job.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.122 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in
the shelter one day,

01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and the first call
was an interview.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went for the interview,
and I was hired for that job.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
If I couldn't pray my problems
away and have healing, per se,

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I could pray for
hope for endurance.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
To endure-- that's all I
wanted, to be able to endure.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.800 align:middle line:90%
And then, I would succeed.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So the keys of passion and
the keys of appreciation

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:18.360 align:middle line:84%
are what I'm here
to talk about today.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And with the keys of
appreciation and passion,

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that's all you need, if
you're like me, to succeed.

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:24.690 align:middle line:90%
We all are different.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:27.060 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how
to be passionate.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how
to be motivated.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Inspiration is from within.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Motivation is from the external.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
So you can go read books.

01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:34.313 align:middle line:84%
You can affiliate
yourself with people

01:18:34.313 --> 01:18:36.278 align:middle line:84%
who think you're a
star before you are,

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:37.320 align:middle line:90%
and you'll become a star.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.403 align:middle line:84%
If you can spend all your
time with only those who

01:18:39.403 --> 01:18:41.548 align:middle line:84%
believe in you and
cut out one by one all

01:18:41.548 --> 01:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
those who don't believe in you.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.710 align:middle line:10%
>> ML, I knew you would have
the perfect message for Emma.

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Isn't she awesome?

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And everything that
you're going through now,

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
your divorce and your loss,
you can see that everybody is

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
dealing with something.

01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so many of these things
happen for you, not to you.

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Your big challenge has
led you to this place.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.315 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's the magic of
the key of passion and the key

01:19:06.315 --> 01:19:08.170 align:middle line:10%
of appreciation.

01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Emma, this is Mandy Morris.

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:13.300 align:middle line:84%
She's a best selling author,
and her book is "Love--

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:15.032 align:middle line:90%
It's How I Manifest."

01:19:15.032 --> 01:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
She's going to share
with you how you can

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.390 align:middle line:90%
create the life of your dreams.

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat, honey.

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:20.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:19:20.915 --> 01:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've heard a little
bit about everything that

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.915 align:middle line:90%
you're going through.

01:19:23.915 --> 01:19:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lot!

01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:28.102 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about vibration?

01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends on
what you're talking about.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It can be many things.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a metaphysical
understanding.

01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
There's the manifestation,
Woo Woo understanding.

01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
my understanding.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to talk to you
about the key of vibration

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.830 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Because although everything
that you've gone through we

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
can't really go back and change
time, even though maybe time

01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:49.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist either.

01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But instead, how
do we move forward?

01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And so this idea of vibration
and my understanding of it

01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.742 align:middle line:84%
and how it's helped me
get through traumas that I

01:19:57.742 --> 01:20:02.580 align:middle line:84%
couldn't control, losses that
were unbelievably painful--

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
but we still have to go
on in the human life--

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.220 align:middle line:84%
was understanding that my
energy creates my future.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not my past.

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But the more that I can
gain control of my now,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.420 align:middle line:84%
of my personal dominant
vibration-- meaning

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
my mental state or
my ideas of life,

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
how I'm interacting with
everything in my environment.

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.117 align:middle line:84%
Because really, my environment
is responding to me.

01:20:26.117 --> 01:20:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Not the other way around, right?

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:28.867 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought
of it that way.

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right!

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
so this idea of vibration
is that if I can get charge,

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
because control is kind of
a negative vibrational word

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:38.060 align:middle line:90%
in itself.

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
If I can get in
charge of my reality,

01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
of my beliefs and my thoughts--
which is really the seed that

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:48.120 align:middle line:84%
starts the whole ability to
manifest what you do desire--

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
then you can get in
control of your vibration.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Now energy, in simplistic
form, is being sent out.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Even right now, maybe
you can feel me.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel you, I
can feel your grief.

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:01.070 align:middle line:90%
But you can also feel my love.

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it will keep
growing as we talk.

01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started looking
at OK, I understand energy.

01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:08.480 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not changing my life.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is changing.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in sick relationships.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm still losing people I love.

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's shifted.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I said OK, well there's
a missing component.

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
What's the next key?

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:21.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was the key of vibration.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So going back to
the beginning, it

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
is our thoughts and
our beliefs that we

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:27.030 align:middle line:84%
exude outwardly into
our environment,

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and our environment
responds to us.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the tricky part
is that we don't

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
realize that a lot of
our energy is happening

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.117 align:middle line:90%
on the unconscious level.

01:21:35.117 --> 01:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So I actually want to give you
a couple tools, if that's cool.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:38.520 align:middle line:84%
You can do them
when you get home.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.843 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the first one
is belief inventory.

01:21:41.843 --> 01:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
complete equation,

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.370 align:middle line:90%
but let's start there.

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:47.083 align:middle line:84%
So the belief
inventory, you could

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:49.500 align:middle line:84%
start with the things maybe
that aren't showing up the way

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.300 align:middle line:90%
you want.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.870 align:middle line:90%
But you could do everything.

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I did love, relationships,
money, career, children,

01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
everything.

01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:59.075 align:middle line:84%
And I'd write down
what are my beliefs.

01:21:59.075 --> 01:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Not my if it was a
perfect day belief,

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
but what do my actions
show my beliefs are?

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.370 align:middle line:90%
That love isn't safe.

01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
That I don't deserve
to make a lot of money.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.615 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever the thing is.

01:22:08.615 --> 01:22:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So get really clear
about your beliefs.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.580 align:middle line:90%
And the second one--

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.910 align:middle line:84%
this one throws everybody
off, but it is so important.

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It is living consciously and
what about you is not you.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So first, what
about you is not you

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is basically this idea of
are we really operating

01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:25.380 align:middle line:90%
as our authentic self?

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:27.845 align:middle line:84%
Because our authentic self is
our natural, high vibrational

01:22:27.845 --> 01:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
self-- the one
that can manifest,

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.620 align:middle line:84%
create the life we want, is at
peace, all that awesome stuff.

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But we lose our way, because
childhood programming, life,

01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:37.050 align:middle line:90%
or traumas.

01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:38.425 align:middle line:84%
And then, we start
saying oh, no.

01:22:38.425 --> 01:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I have to operate this way
to be safe, or to be certain,

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
or because grandma said
so, whatever the thing is.

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second part is
the living consciously.

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Living consciously is literally
what has saved my life,

01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:52.110 align:middle line:90%
and I don't say that lightly.

01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Living consciously,
for me, is this idea

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.760 align:middle line:84%
of how can I make sure in each
moment I'm actually present?

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just present like
I'm really listening to you,

01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and I'm feeling you.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening to this.

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
What's going on up here?

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:04.440 align:middle line:90%
What am I telling myself?

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.452 align:middle line:84%
Am I intimidated because
you're beautiful?

01:23:06.452 --> 01:23:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Am I frustrated because I'm
thinking about my bank account?

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:10.110 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:12.122 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
vibration I'm giving out.

01:23:12.122 --> 01:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, I'm working out
so I'm going to lose weight.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Everything's great.

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:16.340 align:middle line:90%
If I'm like, I hate myself.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm fat.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I hate myself.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm fat.

01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what.

01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we've all been there.

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.915 align:middle line:90%
>> What energy am I sending out?

01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm fat!

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm probably
going to perpetuate it.

01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So when living consciously,
another thing you can do--

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:28.560 align:middle line:90%
literally use your phone.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Set an alarm like every
hour, if it feels right.

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Use your intuition.

01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Your intuition is your tool.

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything I say, run it
through your own filter first.

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Set an alarm and
just ask yourself.

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:38.430 align:middle line:90%
I still do them.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll do energy checkups
or temperature checks.

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:43.195 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be like, how
are you feeling right now?

01:23:43.195 --> 01:23:44.653 align:middle line:84%
Are you connected
to God right now?

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:45.825 align:middle line:90%
Do you need to take a walk?

01:23:45.825 --> 01:23:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you need a second?

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What's the dominant emotion
you're experiencing right now?

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And it got me so conscious
of I'm walking around

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:56.460 align:middle line:84%
in a cesspool of negativity
because of my thoughts,

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
because this is
what I'm feeling.

01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:00.003 align:middle line:90%
I'm frustrated and angry.

01:24:00.003 --> 01:24:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I want life to be different.

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I deserve more, or I'm a victim,
or whatever that stuff was.

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I thought
I was a positive person.

01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:09.432 align:middle line:84%
OK, we've got some
shifting to do.

01:24:09.432 --> 01:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And the most important thing
here, the key to this is

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.075 align:middle line:84%
don't come at it with
guilt or judgment.

01:24:14.075 --> 01:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Love yourself through it,
because every human being

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.160 align:middle line:90%
goes through it.

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.227 align:middle line:84%
But the faster that you
can pour in that love,

01:24:19.227 --> 01:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
the love will actually
lubricate the message

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:24.435 align:middle line:84%
to come through faster, to shift
the reality much more quickly.

01:24:24.435 --> 01:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Mandy, I'm so excited
that you shared with Emma,

01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
because you have such a gift
to express the key of vibration

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
so eloquently so that
everybody can understand it.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And your enthusiasm
is just so contagious.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.190 align:middle line:84%
You talk about how you feel when
you've spent time with someone.

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Spending time with
you is awesome.

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:43.835 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:24:43.835 --> 01:24:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:45.943 align:middle line:84%
Well, every human being
deserves to be free.

01:24:45.943 --> 01:24:48.006 align:middle line:90%
And it's a vibration away.

01:24:48.006 --> 01:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Emma, I am so excited to
introduce you to these next

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%
experts--

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Janis Johnson and
her husband Don Clay.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleased to meet you.

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Have a seat, darling.

01:24:57.670 --> 01:25:00.745 align:middle line:90%
Wait until you hear their story.

01:25:00.745 --> 01:25:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think she wants us
to tell you a little bit about

01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:07.480 align:middle line:84%
some of the challenges
that we've lived through,

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
because I think
that would help you.

01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 17, I had
a near fatal accident.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.890 align:middle line:90%
I was out flying a hang glider.

01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a bad feeling about it,
and I ignored my intuition.

01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And I went out anyway.

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hit the
asphalt from 150 feet.

01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:26.380 align:middle line:84%
My back was broken in several
places, fractured my skull.

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I was in pretty bad shape.

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So here I was, basically
paralyzed from the neck down.

01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
People were trying to
tell me that you have

01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:37.150 align:middle line:90%
to adjust your expectations.

01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So over the long
term, you'd have

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to look at my attitude
and my outlook.

01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I truly believed that
I could do something more.

01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I could do something better.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So even when I started to
get the use of my arms back,

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor said
oh, it's a miracle.

01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you're
not going to walk again.

01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, I started
moving my legs.

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well
you're going to have

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
to have a sedentary life.

01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:06.490 align:middle line:90%
So what did I do?

01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I went to medical school.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It was my passion.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's another key!

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Passion.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I had this passion
to help people.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm going to be
a doctor, and that's that.

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So that was also very
important, because even

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
this accident didn't keep
me from pursuing my passion.

01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Which kind of brings
us to the other key

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to tell you
about, and that's courage.

01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:36.430 align:middle line:84%
To me, courage isn't
the lack of fear thing.

01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:37.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%
To me, courage is facing it.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.370 align:middle line:84%
You look it in the eye, and you
say I'm going to do it anyway.

01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Here's a way to help you
remember these three keys

01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:49.800 align:middle line:90%
and how they fit together.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it kind
of like a triangle,

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:57.960 align:middle line:84%
those three things--
courage, faith, and passion--

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
kind of all fit together,
if you look at it.

01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
courage to tackle something,

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:06.310 align:middle line:90%
you could abandon your passion.

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the faith to
know that you can do something

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.290 align:middle line:84%
or that something
is possible, then it

01:27:14.290 --> 01:27:16.210 align:middle line:90%
brings the other two down.

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But the minute one
of those comes up,

01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.470 align:middle line:90%
it brings everything up.

01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So first of all,
I want to say yes.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:25.240 align:middle line:84%
You are responsible
for your condition.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying that all
of these horrible challenges

01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through, I
invited into my life?

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
This crap I'm dealing
with is my fault?

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, kind of.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.300 align:middle line:90%
And I know, people go, oh.

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, the heck with you then.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to listen to you.

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But it is true, because
people have thoughts.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes, you
just kind of ignore them.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind of go down,
and you get kind of sad.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And you start thinking
about negative things.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you think
about negative things,

01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:00.280 align:middle line:90%
you attract negative things.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you can look
at your thinking

01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and start going away from it
and get interested in life,

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:09.900 align:middle line:90%
it's like OK.

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:11.640 align:middle line:90%
This stuff happened to me.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.680 align:middle line:90%
But what good can come from it?

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking for
things that could be good.

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very
minor at first.

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you take one
step at a time.

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when you do something,
do something effective

01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:25.927 align:middle line:90%
that you're willing to do.

01:28:25.927 --> 01:28:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And then when you've done
that, look for the next thing.

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't seem so overwhelming
when you put it that way.

01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:33.107 align:middle line:90%
>> It's actually much easier!

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's nice to have met you.

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:37.913 align:middle line:84%
You've helped me see things in
such a different perspective.

01:28:37.913 --> 01:28:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's a pleasure.

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.275 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you're very welcome.

01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you both so much for
making the time to help Emma.

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:50.360 align:middle line:10%
I know you have to fly.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just been such a joy.

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.790 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to see you again.

01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Emma, let's go over here.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I have got such a
surprise for you now.

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not really
supposed to do this here,

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
but I think you could
really use the boost.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.720 align:middle line:84%
How would you like to meet your
great, great, great, great,

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.610 align:middle line:90%
great grandmother Gwen?

01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you kidding me?

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I would love to!

01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:17.280 align:middle line:90%
But how would that be possible?

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you've
been talking to her,

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and she sent you to help me.

01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I
don't believe you.

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, wouldn't
that make her 200 years old?

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Things are different here.

01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Time is relative.

01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Life has no real
beginning or real end.

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
like to do something

01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.815 align:middle line:84%
that most people
can't even imagine?

01:29:41.815 --> 01:29:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Gwen!

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Gwen?

01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Gwen?

01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Emma's ready to meet you.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Ladies, I'm here.

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> There she is.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.085 align:middle line:90%
Emma, this is Gwen.
