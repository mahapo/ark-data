00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Jesus came to experience the
reality of the spirit, a power,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.520 align:middle line:84%
a love that calls us to have a
particular concern for people

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:84%
who have been pushed
aside by the powers

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that be, for the
marginalized, the oppressed.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:84%
This, I think, is central to
the experience of holy mystery

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.014 align:middle line:84%
as we experience
that holy mystery

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:40.305 align:middle line:90%
through the teachings of Jesus.

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>We participate in
the mystery of Christ.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Paul said, you are
free in Christ.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Free of this old binding sin
of self-centeredness and pride.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Then you live in the vision
of love and kingdom of God,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
which is feast of equals,
where justice is flowing.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>When Jesus said,
"I am the truth,"

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I understand that to mean
wherever there is truth,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:90%
there is Jesus.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we seek the truth,
we are seeking Jesus.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Or the Buddha would say,
we are seeking the Buddha.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Once a student asked a
teacher, who is the Buddha?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher
said, you are you.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Never mind about the Buddha.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't speak to someone else.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't imagine a Buddha
out there and start

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:90%
speaking to that Buddha.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.025 align:middle line:90%
Just look deeply into yourself.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Buddha has enabled me to see
things about Jesus that I never

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
would have been able
to see without Buddha.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
When I start finding
what I believe

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
is true in other
religions, of course

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't remain in my head.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:10%
It touches my whole being,
my heart, my practice.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:10%
And I start adopting that
religion to some extent.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:10%
I am nurtured by two different
religious traditions,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:10%
my Christian
practice and beliefs

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:10%
and my Buddhist
practice and beliefs.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And both of them--
now they're different.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
it so interesting.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes it
exciting and fruitful.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:84%
My interest in and
Buddhism actually

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
goes way back to when
I was 13, 14 years old,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and I decided that I wanted
to become a missionary priest

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Catholic church.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
The beginning of a long process.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I went to the seminary
through all 14 years

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:90%
and was ordained a priest.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But my primary motivation
in the beginning

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
was, since I loved all these
wonderful Buddhist people,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I felt I had to
convert them to Jesus.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise
they're in big trouble.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Their eternal
salvation is at stake.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But as I then began to actually
study Buddhism-- and even more

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
so as I began to meet
Buddhists and enter

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
into dialogue with Buddhists--
my more academic interest

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhism led to a
decision to start practicing.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Happily, I'm married
to a Buddhist.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Kathy and I do a lot of
talking, and exploring,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and sitting together.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And that has been
extremely enriching.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism helped me discover how
I might more deeply experience

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:90%
the reality of God.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
This was in the
Buddhist insistence

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that truth-- they don't
use the word God--

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
but that truth, ultimate
reality, the way things are,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
is to be found-- is to
be found within myself

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:90%
and within this world.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what I call
God is not an entity out there

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:90%
that has to step into my life.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism stresses, or
affirms, that truth

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
is that which we find
within this world.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It just answered so many
quest-- difficulties I had

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with the-- what is oftentimes an
exaggerated Christian teaching,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and talking about God as if
God is this supreme entity

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
out there, this infinite
father being, this superperson.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why Buddha didn't
want to talk about God.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Because to talk
too much about God,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that distracted you-- you
looking out there, rather than

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:90%
looking into yourself.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
tremendous help.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was in Japan
as a young Jesuit,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching
English and baseball.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And we had a championship team
there with the high school

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and the middle school boys
in Rokko High School in Kobe.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:10%
When I entered the Jesuits,
I was simply Catholic.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I never thought of being
interested in Buddhism.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The Second Vatican
Council changed everything

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:90%
for Catholics.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:10%
The Jesuits,
following the counsel,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:10%
urged us not merely to tolerate
other religions, but to admire

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:10%
them and to promote the
good that they have.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:10%
Because there's good
in every religion.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:10%
And our job was to find out what
was good, all that was good,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:10%
and promote it.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.919 align:middle line:84%
Promote it even as different
from our own understanding

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%
of the truth.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And finally, more
than that, to practice

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
the truth of the other,
to walk in their shoes.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Because only if we walk
in their shoes could

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
we really understand them,
or can appreciate them.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I found out that
many Jesuits were

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
interested in Buddhism,
especially Zen Buddhism.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.735 align:middle line:84%
They introduced me to
Yamada Roshi of Kamakura,

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.074 align:middle line:90%
who knew about us.

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:84%
His son went to one
of our high schools,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:90%
and he was very open to us.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And he welcomed
me into his zendo,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
which was another great gift,
because I really knew nothing.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But the personality of Yamada
Roshi touched me deeply.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And I can't explain
that either, why

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
this man-- just when he
walked into the zendo--

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
touched me so deeply.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I had the feeling
that this is it.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I read later Thomas
Merton said, when

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
he encountered Zen
Buddhism, he said,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
means yet, but this is it.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was
the reasonableness

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:90%
of Zen, the sanity of it.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And the compassionate
lifestyle that it presented

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:90%
was very appealing to me.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Appealing is-- is almost
a command in my spirit

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
that this should
be followed also.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I studied with Maezumi Roshi
for a semester of my sabbatical

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I met Glassman
Roshi, who at that time

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:90%
was his heir apparent.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So Glassman Roshi then
became my teacher.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:84%
He was really wonderful
to me in every way.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
When the time came, he
wanted me to be a teacher.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
There were many Buddhists
who were upset by this,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
because I was
Catholic and Jesuit.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Glassman said to them,
are we one, or are we not?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
he's not even a priest.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.559 align:middle line:90%
He's not a Zen priest.

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:30.679 align:middle line:84%
And Glassman said,
he is a priest.

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:90%
We have to ordain him again?

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:90%
What is this about?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And so he faced down
some serious opposition.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So he probably understood
that the Zen practice does not

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:90%
interfere with anyone's faith.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not about faith at all.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Zen is beyond yes
or no about God.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Zen is a skill, perhaps like
learning to play the piano.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.025 align:middle line:84%
And faith need
not enter into it.

00:08:59.025 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:90%
It can.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.476 align:middle line:90%
It can enrich a faith.

00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:10%
If a person is deeply
practicing his own faith,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:10%
Zen can enrich it.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:10%
But for those who
have no faith, that's

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:10%
perfectly all right too
from a Zen point of view.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We open the possibility of
people being themselves--

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.730 align:middle line:84%
whatever that is--
without judging them.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
This young monk went into the
mountains to find a teacher.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
To find the teacher,
meaning to find life itself.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And deep in the mountains
he heard a voice.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese call this hearing
the voice of the cuckoo.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Something called him
deep in his own nature,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:90%
in his own mind and heart.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said, "All
things are impermanent."

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And the young man was
deeply touched by this.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he heard
it, because he was silent,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:90%
because his search was thorough.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.669 align:middle line:84%
He heard the teaching, all
things are impermanent.

00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>I was born and raised
in a third generation

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Christian family in Korea,
Presbyterian family.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So I went to church every
morning and every Sunday.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:10%
But my encounter with
Buddhism actually

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:10%
start with my personal struggle.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:10%
At the time, I was going
through my divorce.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know
what to do about this.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
I so much suffering.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
I do it, or I not.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching "Women and
Religion" in Cambridge

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Then one day I walk home.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I discovered this Korean temple
in the middle of Central Square

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:90%
in Cambridge.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So I walk in, and they have
a meditation instruction.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So I sat and I learned
meditation instruction.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I need to do
something for my suffering.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Then I went up my very first
interview with the Zen master.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So he asked me,
why are you here?

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
So I say, oh, I'm suffering.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And I did all my
melodramatic stories

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:90%
about I loved this man so much.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But he become a
religious fundamentalist.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.165 align:middle line:90%
And maybe I have to leave.

00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So I pour out all my suffering,
expecting his empathy.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Then Zen master looked at
me in a very quiet spirit,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:90%
and asked me, so?

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, I told you all
this suffering story,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and you just-- your
question is so?

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
So I was kind of angry inside.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I felt this Zen
master doesn't know

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Psychology 101 and
Pastoral Counseling 101.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
He heard this
story of suffering.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:90%
He need to give some comfort.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:90%
But he said, so?

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:90%
So I was kind of dumbfounded.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Then after a little bit
of silence he asked me,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:90%
it's very interesting.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
The first noble
truth of Buddhism

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:90%
is "life is suffering."

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is suffering.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And you just think you
are the only one who

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:90%
are suffering in this world.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think
you are so special?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The first question, first
koan, Zen Master Seung Sahn

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:90%
asked me was, who are you?

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, if you
don't know that answer,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
go to the dharma room
and sit and meditate.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Just ask this
question, who am I?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.615 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And get the answer.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you get the answer,
come back to me and report.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And until that time, you just
sit down and ask who am I?

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So you breathe in who am I,
and breathe out don't know.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Don't know.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to do.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, you
will find the answer,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and you will find
your true self.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.965 align:middle line:84%
Then you will not
suffer anymore.

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So many years passed
with this question.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Who am I really?

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
beginning of my journey.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.215 align:middle line:90%
Keep this don't know mind.

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning, this don't
know gave me kind of anxiety.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
bottom fall apart.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And if really I don't know
the ground of my being, really

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
what am I?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So it gives me kind
of an uneasy feeling.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But with practice
over the year, I

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
started to learn
how to be relaxed.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
How to be-- just to be in that
big don't know with the trust.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:84%
In that trust
everything is possible.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So when my don't know becomes
bigger and bigger, my freedom

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and also my peace and acceptance
is getting bigger and bigger.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So Zen Master Seung
Sahn really gave me

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful first
koan, first question.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Who are you and don't know.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.912 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.912 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a classic story
in Zen of a student coming

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
to the teacher
and saying that he

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.445 align:middle line:84%
is bound by his bad
actions of the past.

00:15:30.445 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Could the teacher free him?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher said, well,
go out and find this self

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that you feel is bound
by your bad actions.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And the student finally says,
well, I can't find that self.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And the teacher says, there.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:90%
I have unbound you.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>The words of Jesus that we
must die to our very self.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
When we first hear
that, it sounds

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:90%
almost impossible or cruel.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It's only later we realize
that it is mercy itself.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the self that we
cling to doesn't exist.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It is a construction
of the human mind.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's necessary to
put that down in order

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to enter the
fullness of reality,

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
where Christ is found from
the Catholic point of view.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:84%
From the Buddhist point
of view, of course,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
it's necessary to transcend
your own mental conceptions

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of the self to reach
something else.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.045 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the effort
in zazen, in the zen hall,

00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:90%
in zen meditation is doing.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
decenter the self,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to get us to cease from
repeating patterns of thought

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
that we've become
accustomed to, and that we

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
identify with our very self.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.916 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist has to free
himself of his Buddhist self.

00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The Christian has
to free himself

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
from his Christian
self to the extent

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that these are
constructs of the mind.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.381 align:middle line:84%
Yamada Roshi said that to me
when I was sitting with him--

00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:84%
he said, I'm not trying
to make you a Buddhist.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to empty you in
imitation of your Lord Jesus

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Christ, who emptied himself.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So Yamada went right to
the heart of Christianity,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that the goal is not to
just repeat Christian dogmas

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
or attend Christian services,
but to recognize and activate

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the oneness you
have with Christ.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And Christ emptied himself.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So the path to Christ,
Yamada Roshi was saying,

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to the
path to the Buddha.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Self emptying.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>It is very difficult
for young Western student

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:90%
understand emptiness.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I-- as soon as
I talk about emptiness,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
they think emptiness is
psychological emptiness.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So they have a big hole
here in their heart,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:90%
or they feel lonely.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
They feel unloved,
and meaningless,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:90%
or sometimes nihilistic.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
And just something is not there.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:90%
They need the feeling.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:90%
They think emptiness is that.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Very negative way.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But Buddhist
emptiness is not that.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist emptiness is, in
a way, it is a fullness.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So I always like what
Thich Nhat Hanh said.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Empty of what?

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:90%
That is important.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:10%
Empty of this solid, unchanging,
fixed self, fixed nature.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So emptiness is
this, really, vortex

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of life energy, where
everything is interconnected

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:90%
and everything come out of it.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So emptiness is
your wide openness

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to see whatever is coming
to you in this life.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Wow, this is new.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.558 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:23.554 align:middle line:90%
That is emptiness.

00:19:23.554 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:10%
>>Ladies and gentlemen,
in this true self

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:10%
there is eternal happiness.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:10%
In this true self,
there is a great freedom

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:10%
that is devoid of
all obstructions.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
You will become one body with
the whole human race and one

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
household with all sentient
beings and insentient beings

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire world.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>The ultimate
concern of Buddhism

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is enlightenment,
waking up to the fact

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that all is profoundly
interrelated, that nothing

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
exists unto itself, that
nothing has its own individual

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
or individualized
being, but that we

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
are all part of an
interconnected reality that

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is-- an interconnected reality
that is vital, alive, and that

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
functions primarily
through compassion,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
or what Christians
would call love.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Prajna, wisdom.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
That is the growing
awareness that I am not just

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
this individual substantial
being, but I am more.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I am-- in Christian language,
I am part of spirit.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Spirit that I see
in Jesus Christ.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But that is my true identity,
not my individual self.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And that gives me, or can
give me, a deep peace.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
In experiencing that, I feel
this connectedness with--

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and that means a compassion and
love for all sentient beings.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>So taking these
Buddhist teachings,

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the
Bible looking at some

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:84%
of the central teachings or
symbols of my Christianity.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that
just-- that just leapt out

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
was Christians-- one
of the primary symbols

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that we Christians use for God
is spirit, spiritus, pneuma,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:90%
ruach.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:84%
This just means
that God is spirit.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And what is spirit?

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Spirit is that which animates.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is that which
fills us, which

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
moves in ways in which we
can never truly perceive

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:90%
or forecast.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:90%
But spirit is alive.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the symbol of spirit
from my Christian tradition

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
became alive with meaning,
not just for my head,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
but for my prayer,
for my meditation.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
To feel or to imagine
the ultimate God

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
as this interconnecting
spirit, this

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
beautiful-- this
interconnecting spirit.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
There are very few definitions
of God in the New Testament.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, maybe there's
only two or three

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:90%
where it says, "God is."

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And those instances-- they come
from the writings attributed

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:90%
to John-- God is love.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:90%
God is spirit.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two,
love and spirit.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Well love is the
compassionate energy

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:90%
of the interconnecting spirit.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you see,
this is where God

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
is no longer an
entity out there.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.971 align:middle line:84%
But Buddhism has
helped me-- and I'm not

00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
saying that Buddhism is the
only way to discover this.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Certainly not.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But Buddhism is a way of
helping Christians to-- perhaps

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
to come to a
deeper-- and I would

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:84%
say more personal,
more mystical--

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:90%
more mystical experience of God.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>More and more I feel my
Christian notion of God as love

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and my Buddhist
notion of don't know.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:90%
They come together.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.782 align:middle line:90%
Almost like a love meets wisdom.

00:23:40.782 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:10%
This big don't know beyond all
concept and all name and forms.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:84%
If we really trust
this don't know mind,

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
in the don't know
everything is possible.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like actually we don't know
what is the best for our life,

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
whether what we think
is necessary for us

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
to be happy and
wholesome-- we need

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:84%
to have this, and this, and
this-- that's what we think.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not
what we really need

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:90%
to have an enlightened life.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So this don't know mind
taught me radical humility.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:90%
You really don't know.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.744 align:middle line:84%
So whatever needs
arise around you,

00:24:35.744 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
you respond freely
with open heart,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:84%
without cleaning to your
old unchanging self.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Christian notion of being in
Christ and Buddhist notion

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
of no self and true self
have something in common.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You are free from
this binding ego.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Then open to
receive love of God,

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and open to act as a
good Christian disciple

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:90%
or a good bodhisattva.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
My favorite words from
Christian tradition

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
actually came from so-called
"gnostic gospel," gospel

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:90%
of Thomas.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
There Jesus talks
about salvation.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, if
you bring out what

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is within you, what is
within you will save you.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you cannot bring
out what is within you,

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
what is within you
will destroy you.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I heard that
message of Jesus, I feel, yes.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
What is within you is
true self, our true self,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
which is not binding
to either our sin

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
or this unchanging,
solid illusion of a self.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Gautama became Buddha
because he woke up.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, the son of Mary,
became Christ the Son of God

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:84%
because he woke up to
the divine spirit that

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
was given to him
in his very being.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Karl Rahner said, "To
say that Jesus is divine,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:54.650 align:middle line:84%
means that Jesus realized
the full potential

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:90%
of what it means to be human."

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:84%
What it means to be human is
to wake up to, to be open to,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of God
that is given to us,

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that is given to us by God in
our very-- in our very beings.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
When we are created,
when we come forth,

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
we already are
human beings endowed

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
with God's spirit,
sustained by God's spirit.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Our problem is we don't know it.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't trust it.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we've grown
up in situations

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
where that has just
become so obscured.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus, or Buddha,
can help us realize it.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But when we realize it, it's not
just something that's up here.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a realization that becomes
power, energy, transformative,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:90%
or what Christians call grace.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Grace is not
something from outside.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Grace is the very
presence of God within us,

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
enlightening us, humanizing us.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
The greater our humanity,
then the greater capacity

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:84%
we have to receive God's grace
in Christian theological terms.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Thiard says the fire of heaven
has to come down on something.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We're expected to do our part
in developing our human nature,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
even though that,
too, is a grace.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So every step forward we
take to develop our nature,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
God's grace is there to meet
us, to enliven us, to enrich it.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.005 align:middle line:84%
To become one with yourself,
to see the breadth of the self,

00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
or the light of the self,
or the beauty of the self,

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is then to recognize the
breadth, and the beauty,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and the light of Christ.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Because we are not separate.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:84%
It is Christ growing within
us in all that we do.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
We can think of Christ
in a relational sense,

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that Christ is another
whom we love, or serve,

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.200 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But it is also very Catholic to
see that Christ is not other.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I am not simply a
friend of Christ,

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.545 align:middle line:90%
but I am Christ himself.

00:29:21.545 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you not know,
as Saint Paul says,

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:90%
you are the body of Christ?

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:90%
You are Christ himself.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And the other is Christ himself.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It's that unity of
Christ with the world

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and with each one of us that
is an intimacy of identity, not

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:90%
just relationship, but identity.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.849 align:middle line:84%
So everyone we meet, as the
Irish prayer says, is Christ.

00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Saint Paul writes to
the Galatian community.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:07.330 align:middle line:84%
He says, it is no
longer I who live,

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:12.030 align:middle line:84%
but Christ who lives
in me and as me.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Paul is saying, I'm not living.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:84%
It's Christ who's
living, however, in me.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.782 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is helping
me to comprehend that.

00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
That brings me to a different
understanding of Paul Knitter.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.552 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.552 --> 00:30:35.530 align:middle line:84%
When you can really be
mindful of this present moment

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that
its depth, its mystery,

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:84%
is deeper than any
thought you have,

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:84%
any feeling that you have, it's
hard to find words for this.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
feel that you are

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
held, that you are sustained,
that what you really are

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
is deeper than what
you think you are,

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
or than anything
anybody says you are.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:90%
It's deeper.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And that reality is
the Christ spirit.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
That reality is
our Buddha nature.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:90%
That's who I really am.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists say, if you can really
be mindful of this moment,

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.290 align:middle line:84%
it will provide
all that you need.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the power.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are
mindful of your thinking,

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and you don't let
your thinking define

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:90%
what is real in this moment.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:84%
My thought that I am-- I'm
thinking that I'm afraid.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that
I'm inadequate.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that-- I
mean-- or I feel I'm angry.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:84%
When I'm aware of my anger, when
I'm aware of my fear, and I say

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:90%
that's my feeling.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:84%
That's not what is
real in this moment.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:90%
What is really real?

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts that I have and
the feelings that I have of

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:09.690 align:middle line:84%
despondency, of inadequacy,
of meaninglessness.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of them.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Let them be.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.049 align:middle line:90%
Don't fight them.

00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Because so often in
the past, I'd go,

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.275 align:middle line:84%
oh, I shouldn't be
feeling this way.

00:32:17.275 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Well damn it, I
do feel this way.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:90%
This is who I-- Accept that.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
kind of letting

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.060 align:middle line:90%
go which includes acceptance.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
You accept the fact of
what you're feeling.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.290 align:middle line:90%
And then you let it go.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.950 align:middle line:90%
But first you have to accept it.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:84%
There is something that can be
almost miraculous about that.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>When we sit well, all
our sins, if you will,

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:84%
or our limitations disappear
like frost or snow.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:90%
They just vanish.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Because this moment is the
only moment that truly exists.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
The past is memory; the
future is speculation.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Sit right now.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.175 align:middle line:90%
Work right now.

00:33:09.175 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Serve right now.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Do it well.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:84%
As we get older, we
realize our limitations.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:90%
They can almost crush us.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And we realize the difficulty
of change, even for the better.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:84%
But it is not good
Zen practice to become

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with the idea
of growth, or change,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:90%
or enlightenment.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:38.370 align:middle line:90%
That can just make us sick.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:41.315 align:middle line:84%
We must accept ourselves
as we are in this moment.

00:33:41.315 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Accept the light that we
have, even if we don't see it.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.307 align:middle line:84%
And be grateful for it
and grateful for the gifts

00:33:51.307 --> 00:33:56.640 align:middle line:90%
of others who can teach us.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Don't tie ourselves in a knot
trying to improve ourselves.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.154 align:middle line:84%
That just puts the
emphasis back on the self

00:34:03.154 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:90%
instead of the moment.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:10%
For me, zazen is prayer, to come
into the presence of mystery

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:10%
and sit with attention,
physical attention, too.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Physical attention in the
presence of ultimate truth.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:84%
To sit with reverence for
that truth and gratitude

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:84%
for the experience
itself is prayer.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%
Attention, reverence,
gratitude need not be spoken.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to use the words.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.940 align:middle line:90%
What would I do with words?

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Would I try to remind God
of something God forgot?

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Would I beseech God to pay
attention to someone else,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.752 align:middle line:84%
as if God was not
paying attention?

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Being fully in
the present moment

00:34:53.390 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
is when joyful situation
arise, you become joyful.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.220 align:middle line:84%
A very painful situation
arise, and you feel pain.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And something sad
appears, you are sad.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And something really
fantastic appears,

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:90%
you are totally surprised.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So you are like a very
fresh child, in a way,

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to see everything
for the first time.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like falling
in love with life,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:84%
as if every moment
is your first love.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:90%
So that is a present moment.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know it
when I was younger,

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:84%
because I have big
dreams and big ambitions.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted so much in life.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And I want this.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I want that.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And then so much want always
brings so much suffering.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are moment
in my life I had

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:90%
a really dark night of soul.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.700 align:middle line:90%
I walked into the valley.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I got so
depressed it is unbearable.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And that moment, I learned
how to be in present moment

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:24.620 align:middle line:84%
from my psychotherapist and
from my great Buddhist teachers.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Present moment.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.840 align:middle line:90%
That's all we have.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
It's this very moment,
only here, and only now.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is what life is
presenting to us every moment.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And we miss this,
we miss entire life.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I wish I got it 30 years ago.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:90%
But that is all we have.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But most of us are really
most of the time regretting

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:03.141 align:middle line:84%
about the past and
worrying about future.

00:37:03.141 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But when we really know how
to be at the present moment,

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
then even big
suffering is bearable.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So present moment in my very
difficult time of life--

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:90%
it pulled me through.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It carried me like a great wind,
a great love, or a very loving

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
mother take me just this moment,
next moment, next moment.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Then you will be fine.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>I first read this, and
it touched me very deeply.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a wonderful
expression of someone who

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.453 align:middle line:90%
had an enlightenment experience.

00:37:57.453 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:84%
"Even if I don't see it again,
nor ever feel it, I know it is.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And that if once it
held me, it ever does.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And so it is myself
I want to turn

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
in that direction,
not a sort of place,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.510 align:middle line:84%
but it was a tilting
within myself.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:84%
As one turns a mirror to flesh,
the light to where it isn't, I

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
was blinded like that and
swam at what shown at me.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Only able to endure it by being
no one and so specifically

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.620 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd died
being loved like that."

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The final goal of our Zen work
is the compassionate outreach

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:90%
to others in effective service.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Almost all religions
realize that's what

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
they are moving for--
to get the person

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:90%
to be active and effective.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Out of dreamland into
a practical world,

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:09.870 align:middle line:84%
where he operates in
a compassionate way.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.380 align:middle line:84%
That is what the meditation
is all about-- people

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:84%
striving for light and
for wisdom in order

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that their lives can be more
given to compassionate service.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.570 align:middle line:84%
It's never enlightenment
for itself.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.322 align:middle line:90%
It's never wisdom for itself.

00:39:27.322 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a great
line in "Bodhidharma,"

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:84%
when he says to cling
to wisdom is stupidity.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:84%
First of all, who
knows if you're wise?

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Who cares if you're wise, unless
they see it in your activity?

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Feed the hungry, drink to the
thirsty, clothe the naked,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:50.262 align:middle line:84%
visit those who are sick,
visit those in prison,

00:39:50.262 --> 00:39:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and make a habit of it.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>When Christians say, we
have to stand up for the poor.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to change the
structures of the government

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:90%
and the economic policies.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Buddhists will say, yes.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to
be able to really change

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:84%
those structures unless
you, yourself, are changed.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Unless you, yourself,
are transformed.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Or the way Thich
Nhat Hanh puts it,

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.300 align:middle line:84%
you are not going to
be able to attain--

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to make peace unless
you are peace.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But then the Christians will
say to the Buddhists, yes.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.920 align:middle line:84%
We've learned from you we
need to transform ourselves.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But don't stop
there as sometimes

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:84%
has happened in
history, where we

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:84%
get so taken up with the wonder,
the peace of our enlightenment,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:84%
of our personal transformation,
that we do not carry through

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:84%
with the compassion that that
experience stirs up in us.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:84%
To recognize that
I'm not going to be

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:57.150 align:middle line:84%
able to practice love and
compassion for the poor,

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
for the oppressed, unless I am
out there confronting City Hall

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and trying to change the
policies in Washington

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or the policies in
London, unless I also

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:90%
get politically involved.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists say, you cannot make
peace unless you are peace.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Christians say,
well once you are peace,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.040 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get
busy making peace.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:90%
We can really help each other.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:90%
We need to help each other.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>That is why interfaith
dialogue is so important.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not always that they teach
us something entirely new,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.150 align:middle line:84%
but they might frame it
in a way that energizes us

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:84%
in a way our own vocabulary
did not energize us.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we say the same things
over and over in the liturgy

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and we lose
the urgency of words

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:90%
or the depth of words.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:84%
When it comes in a
different vocabulary,

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:84%
from a different framework,
sometimes you say,

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:90%
why wasn't I told this before?

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Well of course, you were told
before, but you see it anew.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Christianity is my father.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism is like my mother.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They came together, and I
become a Buddhist Christian.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And I hope this new
generation of young people

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and next generation
of the children

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:84%
can get more benefit from
the learning from world

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:29.060 align:middle line:84%
great tradition, and
world great religions,

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.340 align:middle line:90%
and the wisdom in compassion.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So rather than excluding
some religions in order

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to be faithful to
your religion, you

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.580 align:middle line:84%
can be fully faithful
to your religion,

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:84%
but also open wide
to other wisdom.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Thich Nhat Hanh said
these beautiful things

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:84%
in Christian root and
Buddhist root get together,

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and you have a grafting of tree.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And it become a bigger
tree and more beautiful,

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:90%
flourishing tree.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So under that
beautiful green shadow,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:84%
more people can
find peace and rest.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.700 align:middle line:90%
