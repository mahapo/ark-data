00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The higher you go, the
smaller it all becomes as you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
begin to see the essence
of others and of yourself,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.794 align:middle line:84%
to experience the
interconnectedness of all life.

00:00:50.794 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
As you contemplate your reality
through your eye, the window

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of your perception, your world
gathers its elemental senses

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.595 align:middle line:90%
to mirror your awareness.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:16.871 align:middle line:84%
The truth of creation
gazes back at you.

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of us think that we
behave for reasons that we

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
understand, but most of our
behavior is actually governed

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:90%
by unconscious forces.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the psychedelic
plants can manifest

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:90%
what's in the unconscious mind.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:84%
What you will bring out
of you will save you.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.462 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> People's minds are opening,
and we are seeing this rapid

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
evolution in consciousness
that's accelerating

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:90%
at an exponential rate.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.442 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're about to watch
a documentary about plant

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:90%
medicines and psychedelics.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Just a few short years ago, my
entire perspective towards them

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
was shattered and
then reconstructed

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:90%
in a whole new light.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
And my intention
of making this film

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
is to share the other
side the story with you.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:90%
So where does the journey begin?

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Life has its ups and downs,
and at a period in my life

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
where I felt totally
lost, unsure,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I started searching for answers.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And where does one
search for answers?

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The Bible, spiritual
texts, family and friends,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
elders, a psychiatrist
maybe, or, of course,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:90%
the trusted Google.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
That's where I
usually like to go.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.215 align:middle line:84%
So one night I was
doing a YouTube.

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I was watching something
like Alan Watts,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and in the comment
section, someone

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
referenced the name
Terence McKenna.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if that actual
comment was directed directly

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:90%
at me.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I could have been the
only one who saw it.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And what it said
was, if you really

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
want to have your
mind blown, you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:90%
have to look up Terence McKenna.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So I quickly entered his
name into a Google search

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:90%
and hit Enter.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
realize at the time,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
but that search alone right
there changed my entire life.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Within a couple hours, I had
ordered all of his books.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
He spoke in such a way
that just sort of caught

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.463 align:middle line:84%
my attention in a way that
had never been before.

00:03:14.463 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So within the span
of a couple of weeks,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.047 align:middle line:90%
I had made up my mind.

00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I would be traveling
solo to South America

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to partake in my first
ever ayahuasca experience.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know how profound
the experience would be.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
When I went there, I was
envisioning addicts, maybe

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
some trippers, maybe
some punk metal

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
type enthusiasts, a lot
of hippie type people.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But when I got there, it
was quite the contrary.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
There were doctors, lawyers,
professionals, artists,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:90%
authors, athletes.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.962 align:middle line:84%
It was a mix of everybody, and
I realized that everyone was

00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:90%
there for a different reason.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.628 align:middle line:84%
I was there because
I was a seeker.

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:48.308 align:middle line:84%
Other people were
going through trauma,

00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was really interesting
to see that, wow, there's

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
so much depth to this one thing
that ties us all in common.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.275 align:middle line:90%
So now I needed answers.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I had so many
questions, and that's

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
what really spawned me
to make this documentary.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
More than anything,
I really wanted

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
to know if we as human beings
were meant to have altered

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So after I sat there with
all these incredible people,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
meeting them for the first time,
with all these questions racing

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
through my mind, the main
one that stuck out was,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
had we been psyched out?

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this film, you'll
see just a few examples

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:84%
of the relentless
propaganda attack

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
on psychedelics and
plant medicines that

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
has gone on for almost
a century now, which

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is a continuing war that
has gone on for much,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:90%
much, much longer.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> From the very beginnings
of unrecorded time,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
men have reached for substances
in the world around them that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.258 align:middle line:84%
would alter, extend,
and materially change

00:04:58.258 --> 00:04:59.425 align:middle line:90%
their perception of reality.

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The reasons-- loneliness and
fear, boredom, and a desire

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:90%
for the new and the unknown.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Some have used these
drugs to journey

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
into the uncharted tunnels
of the mind in search

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
of medical and scientific truth.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Others look behind the
curtain just for kicks.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> This emergence into
consciousness was triggered

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:84%
by our ancestors' encounters
with visionary plants

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of shamanism.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.968 align:middle line:84%
If you analyze the
cave art-- there's

00:05:46.968 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
not time to go into
the details here,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.927 align:middle line:84%
but there are so
many details that

00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
make it clear that this
was an art of altered

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness,
of visions,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and that plants like
the amanita muscaria

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
mushroom, or
psilocybin mushrooms,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
appear to have been
directly connected

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.662 align:middle line:84%
with this sudden
and radical change.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When we originally created
the historical timeline

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
for this documentary,
we realized it could be

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:90%
a documentary in itself.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.895 align:middle line:84%
We condensed it to a
very simplified version.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult to
pinpoint the origin

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.448 align:middle line:84%
of many of the psychedelics and
plant medicines in this movie.

00:06:23.448 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
In this timeline,
the farther back we

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
go into history, the more
guesswork and theorizing we

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:90%
have to do.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we get
closer to modern day,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
more evidence is
readily available.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Please keep in mind
that these dates

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
are based on what
is currently known,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.937 align:middle line:84%
and new discoveries can
potentially push these dates

00:06:36.937 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:90%
back indefinitely.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.122 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example, the
iboga plant from Africa.

00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Traditions say it has been used
since the beginning of time

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.325 align:middle line:84%
and actually represents the tree
of knowledge of good and evil.

00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I find this interesting, because
they are not the only ones who

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:90%
have made this suggestion.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.113 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians' representation
of the tree of life

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:84%
was the acacia
tree, known to have

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
contained DMT, one of the most
powerful psychedelics known

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:90%
to man.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, many scholars

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
believe that this
same bush, the acacia,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
was also the burning bush
in the story of Moses

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:84%
when he had visions of God that
came to him on the mountain.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Adam and Eve story,
could the forbidden fruit

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
have been the amanita
muscaria mushroom?

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Terence McKenna was a
supporter of this theory.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The mushroom is the
fleshy, spore bearing,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:90%
fruiting body of a fungus.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the Bible, there are
many passages and references

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that can easily be interpreted
as psychedelic in suggestion

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
simply by re-analyzing
a few simple words--

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.743 align:middle line:84%
fruiting body of a
fungus, forbidden fruit.

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Another theory that
Terence McKenna postulated

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
was that the food of the
gods, the psychedelic plants,

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.595 align:middle line:84%
were actually what
caused man to evolve

00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
into the current human
beings we are today.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.777 align:middle line:84%
Over a two million year period,
our brains doubled in size.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Current theory suggests that
we evolved through a change

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.758 align:middle line:84%
our diet, which is primarily
due to meat consumption.

00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
However, there are many
carnivorous animals

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that have not
evolved, and there are

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
primates like the
chimpanzee that

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.767 align:middle line:84%
do eat their fair
share of meat and have

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.693 align:middle line:90%
yet to evolve, as well.

00:07:57.693 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
During that two
million year span,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
various droughts and
changing climates

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.158 align:middle line:84%
caused the forest to recede,
and many of the lower primates

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:84%
ventured out of the jungles
onto the grassy plains in search

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:90%
for food.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
While searching for bugs
under cow dung patties,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
they would find magic
mushrooms, the consumption

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of which would lead
to cognitive advances

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
within these primates
and potentially lead

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.165 align:middle line:84%
to an evolution into the current
Homo sapiens we are today.

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
This is what has been come to
known as stoned ape theory.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.977 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.977 --> 00:08:26.185 align:middle line:84%
Where we start to see a
little more concrete evidence

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
is in the various cave paintings
found throughout the world.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.997 align:middle line:84%
Some dating back as
far as 40,000 years

00:08:30.997 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
have shown various references
to the possibilities

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.427 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic or antigen use.

00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Things such as you
metric waves coming

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
from the minds of the
various indigenous peoples

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and even things as
clear as mushroom heads

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.220 align:middle line:84%
were found painted on
the walls of these caves.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Around 15,000 BC,
we find evidence

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of cannabis cultivation, which
throughout history after this

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.892 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much found
throughout the world.

00:08:49.892 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
We also start to see
psychedelic mushroom cultivation

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.357 align:middle line:84%
Around 4,000 BC, evidence
of Siberian shamanism,

00:08:57.357 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:84%
who used the amanita muscaria
mushroom in their rituals,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:90%
was discovered.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
In 3,000 BC in Egypt, we see
references to the blue lotus

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
flower, a known psychedelic
plant, as well as

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
a plant called
mandrake, also known

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:90%
for its psychedelic properties.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
the first evidence

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
is found of the use of
ayahuasca in the Amazon,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as peyote and
other mind altering cacti

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
throughout the rest
of the Americas.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
By this time,
cannabis cultivation

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is in full swing in China used
as both fiber and medicine.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Just after 2000 BC, the
mysteries became wildly popular

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
in Greece, and after
four days of fasting,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
a substance called
kykeon was ingested

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
that led to profound visions
and deep understandings of life

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and death.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Around the same time,
roughly 1500 BC,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
the Rigvedas are
written in India,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.975 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
plant god named soma.

00:09:42.975 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
knowledge around soma

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.835 align:middle line:84%
had been lost
throughout history.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.877 align:middle line:84%
However, it is believed
to be a psychedelic drink

00:09:47.877 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:84%
of some kind known for
increasing awareness, imparting

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
mystical experiences,
poetic inspiration, and even

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:90%
immortality.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Some say that soma may have been
made from psychedelic mushrooms

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and be the reason why the
cow is considered so holy,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%
as the mushrooms grow
directly out of the cow dung.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Around 1000 BC, stones
carved into mushrooms

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
are found all over the
Mesoamerican cultures,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
including the Olmecs,
Incas, and Mayans.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The Aztecs called these
mushrooms [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
which literally means
flesh of the gods.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Around the 4th century AD
is where things get bad

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.683 align:middle line:90%
for psychedelics.

00:10:23.683 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Christianity became the legal
religion of the Roman state,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and all other beliefs
were condemned.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Over the next 1,000
years or so, we

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
witness the dark ages
and the Crusades,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
where numerous people were
killed for not being Christian,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and most other tradition
tradition is destroyed.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
This continued right
through the 1500s,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
where European colonizers
destroyed the Aztec empire

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and many other North
American indigenous

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:90%
traditions and people.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
It took a while for
psychedelics to resurface

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
simply due to the
stigma surrounding them.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people who used them were
considered warlocks, witches,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:90%
or crazy.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
In 1938, LSD was
discovered, and by the 1950s

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
was being studied heavily
by many organizations,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:90%
including the CIA.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.115 align:middle line:84%
A huge turning
point was in 1957,

00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:84%
when "Life" magazine published
an article on psychedelics

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and instantaneously
boosted their popularity.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.813 align:middle line:84%
The '60s ushered in a new age
of widespread psychedelic use

00:11:11.813 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
before the American
government shut them

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
down totally in the '70s and
declares the war on drugs.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.985 align:middle line:84%
All scientific studies
are put on a standstill.

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:22.110 align:middle line:84%
In the last few decades,
it seems that psychedelics

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.660 align:middle line:84%
are reemerging out
of the shadows,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.887 align:middle line:84%
and we are witnessing a
psychedelic renaissance.

00:11:25.887 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Many people are starting to see
the true nature of these plant

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
medicines and have
been drawn towards them

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.035 align:middle line:90%
for one reason or another.

00:11:33.035 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Does it make sense
that something

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that has been used
throughout history

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
be vilified and criminalized
as they have been today?

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In the '60s, they really
were used in dysfunctional ways

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and created a lot of suffering.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And that covered their
possible therapeutic use.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very much
like the sorcerer's

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:90%
apprentice phenomenon.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.868 align:middle line:84%
You get something very powerful,
but whether it's beneficial

00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's harmful
depends on who's using it

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and for what purpose.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So in the '60s, they were very
often used in negative ways

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't under
the guidance of experience

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, before I took
psychedelics ever,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
we have to go pretty far back
into the '60s, because my

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
brother and I were really
children of the '60s.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And we were influenced
by the social movements

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
around especially LSD.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:84%
LSD was the catalytic
psychedelic of that era,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:90%
much as ayahuasca is now.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that these
things were there,

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but very few people
had access to them.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
After Wasson's articles
about the magic mushroom

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
cults in Mexico came out, that
actually predated the '60s.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
His article in "Life"
magazine in 1957

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, one of
the big events that

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
really brought psychedelics
into mass awareness.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
"Life" magazine was
on the kitchen table

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
of every house of
America practically,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%
and everybody was pushing.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was
exploring about what

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
is this new phenomenon
of psychedelics.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.955 align:middle line:90%
And what does this really mean?

00:13:18.955 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And they hadn't been
around long enough

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
for people to really get
a negative impression yet,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
even though the
government and the media

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
was doing their best to kind
of show it in a negative light.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it
was, but at the time,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
there was just a lot
of curiosity about it.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
consciousness expansion

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
was even kind of a new
cultural meme at that time,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and so they weren't really
stigmatized in the mid '60s.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They were catalysts for
change, and the institutions

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
like governments, and
educational institutions,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and religion don't like change.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
The women's movement, the
environmental movement,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
the anti-war movement--
all of these things

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:84%
were directly influenced
by psychedelics.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
At critical junctures
in human history,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.692 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics have
always been part of it,

00:14:16.692 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and they continue
to be part of it.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
without any respect for
them, without any knowledge,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:90%
without any context.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And the society wasn't
ready for so many people.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The society was still
very adolescent.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What I saw was this massive
crackdown that not only

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
criminalized psychedelics,
but stopped all the scientific

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:90%
research all over the world.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:38.804 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you want to join me here?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.203 align:middle line:84%
Won't you be seated, please,
ladies and gentlemen?

00:15:42.203 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Come out here Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
summarize for you

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the meeting that I have just
had with bipartisan leaders.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
America's public enemy number
one in the United States

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.195 align:middle line:90%
is drug abuse.

00:16:00.195 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What exactly are these
illegal substances called

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.885 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics anyways?

00:16:03.885 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
A psychedelic
defined is something

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that causes a
hallucinogenic effect

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.047 align:middle line:84%
or causes an expansion
of consciousness.

00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of the psychedelics
you may be familiar

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
with are called LSD,
ayahuasca, psilocybin,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
like magic mushrooms, DMT,
dimethyltryptamine, mescaline,

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
peyote, San Pedro cactus,
and the list goes on.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Even sometimes MDMA will be
put in the same category.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
All of these and many
more that I've just listed

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%
are classified as
Schedule I narcotics.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes in these troubled
days the very thoughtlessness

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
of youth has led to
a living nightmare.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Addiction to drugs,
too often acquired

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
with tragic
carelessness, may take

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
control of a life and force
actions not dreamed of before.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
To these addicts,
life's only work

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:90%
is to find money for drugs.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:84%
In their desperation,
no means is too foul.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.515 align:middle line:84%
>> The most restrictive drug
classification is a Schedule I

00:17:03.515 --> 00:17:04.315 align:middle line:90%
substance.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:84%
A Schedule I substance is
no recognized medical use,

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
potentially dangerous, highly
subject to abuse or addiction.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.625 align:middle line:84%
In other words, no
redeeming value at all.

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> A little bit of
health news for you.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
A single dose of
psychedelic magic mushrooms

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
can make people
with severe anxiety

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and depression feel
better for months.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Doctors with New York University
and Johns Hopkins University

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
performed independent tests
with the illegal ingredient

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:90%
psilocybin.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They found it helped
cancer patients relax

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and ease anxiety and depression
in 80% of the patients studied.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, the
effects lasted for months.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a great arbitrariness
in the definition of what

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:90%
should be legal and what isn't.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So the example I often
give is that of opiate use

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:90%
versus cigarette smoking.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Cigarette smoking
is far more harmful

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its health
impact and its destruction

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:90%
of human life.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, give
me 100 people who smoke

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:90%
and 100 people who use opiates.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
As long as they don't overdose,
those 100 with the opiates

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
will be far healthier
30 years later than

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
if they smoked cigarettes,
and many more of them

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:90%
will be alive.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So which is the more
harmful substance?

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's OK to go and get drunk,
because that gives you a little

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
break, and then next day,
despite your hangover,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
you can get back to your job.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Or it's OK for big
pharma to prescribe

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of consciousness
altering drugs

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to deal with often invented
psychological issues,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
such as depression or
hyperactivity disorder.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
These accepted consciousness
altering substances,

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
like alcohol, like the
pharmaceutical drugs--

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.508 align:middle line:84%
they actually, in a way,
underpin the alert problem

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
solved in the state
of consciousness,

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:90%
but psychedelics don't.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics lead to
questioning about everything--

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves, about
our place in the world,

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:90%
and about social structures.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that the dominating powers

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.065 align:middle line:84%
in our society don't
want to see happen.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was trying to find
out how many people were dying

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.162 align:middle line:84%
of overdose on these
psychedelic substances,

00:19:14.162 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and it was very hard to find.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.233 align:middle line:84%
The numbers were so low it's
hard to even find data on them.

00:19:18.233 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
In this chart here, you'll see
the amount of deaths caused

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
by different sorts
of substances,

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelics were
not even big enough

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:90%
to get a blip on the list.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even make
it on the radar.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
One other thing that is a
really, really interesting

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:84%
point to mention is that
more people die annually

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
from drug related
offenses that they're

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
incarcerated for and then
executed for than actually die

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
overdosing on things that
cannabis and psychedelics

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.063 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
The number of
studies that are now

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.105 align:middle line:84%
out there that are
showing the benefits

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:84%
for emotional, physical,
mental are growing in number

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.608 align:middle line:84%
every single month, and
it's very, very promising

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to see where the future
might go with this stuff.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was curious
to see what were

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.795 align:middle line:84%
the effects, not only on the
user, but also on society.

00:19:57.795 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happened that a
guy by the name with Professor

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
David J Nutt had already
done this exact study,

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and he ranked all the narcotics
and substances on a scale of 0

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
to 100, and basically
100 being the worst,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:90%
and 0 being the best.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:84%
The one that scored the highest
was alcohol at a number of 72,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and things like LSD scored 7.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
MDMA scored only a 9,
and psilocybin was a 6,

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
showing that the
relative, I guess,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
dangers to people and the people
around them was relatively low.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people aren't aware,
but in 2001, Portugal

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:90%
decriminalized all drugs.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Their drug induced
mortality rate

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.182 align:middle line:84%
went from one of the highest to
one of the lowest in the world,

00:20:39.182 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and in addition to that,
an amazing side effect

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
was that their overall crime
rate reduced significantly,

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more people are
saying the war on drugs is

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally wasteful, racist,
is focused on building prisons

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:90%
instead of building schools.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there will be
a general switch in society

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
towards public health,
rather than criminal justice

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
approaches to the
problems of drug abuse,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.488 align:middle line:84%
because legalization
will not solve

00:21:06.488 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:90%
all the problems of drug abuse.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.185 align:middle line:84%
It just solves the problems
of the criminalization

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
of prohibition,
just the same way

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that the legalization of alcohol
and ending alcohol prohibition

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
hasn't solved all
alcohol problems.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE],, which is
another substance that is really

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:84%
dramatically and powerfully
useful in the treatment

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
of opiate addiction-- in fact,
it's quite astonishing what it

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:90%
can do.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But somebody did approach the
pharmaceutical companies, so I

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.115 align:middle line:84%
heard, with [INAUDIBLE],,
and they not interested,

00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
because why would they be
interested in a substance

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that a person would
only use once or twice,

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:90%
and their addiction is finished?

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
They'd much rather make
methadone or other substances

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that you have to take daily
for the rest of your life.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, we so
freaked out the DEA,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
because they had no idea that
MDMA was used therapeutically--

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
only ecstasy was all
that they were aware of.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So when this group of
doctors from Harvard Medical

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
School and elsewhere
were on this petition

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
that I filed with DEA, we
took them totally by surprise.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And then when the hearings
started happening,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and we were getting
this major media

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
with all these religious
people talking,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
they just didn't
know what to do.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And they panicked,
and so they put MDMA--

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
they criminalized it
in an emergency basis

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:84%
while the hearings
were still going on.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we
won the hearing.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The DEA administrative
law judge said that MDMA

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:90%
should stay legal for therapy.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It should be illegal
for recreational use,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:90%
but legal for therapy.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's definitely a
prohibition that has been going

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
on with hallucinogens, any
type of substance that alters

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:90%
the mood or alters the mind.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And these prohibitions,
as much as they

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:84%
may be looked at as the
government, or the man

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
enforcing rules upon us-- and
whether they may be arbitrary

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
or not, there is a lot of talk
about keeping hallucinogens out

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of the hands of people,
making them illegal,

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
passing legislation
to make it very

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:84%
difficult and punitive when you
get caught with hallucinogens.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:90%
A culture like that--

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of course you're going to find
people saying that they don't

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
want us thinking, using the they
as whatever forces they may be.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
That's what government
is all about.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It's about that gray
area and finding

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
the balance between
protecting the people,

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and not cracking down too
hard, and imposing rule

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:90%
on everything in life.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I'm no science
major, but I found it quite

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.160 align:middle line:84%
interesting that the
molecular structure of most

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of the psychedelic compounds was
very similar to the endogenous

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitters, things
like serotonin, dopamine,

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.103 align:middle line:90%
norepinephrine.

00:24:12.103 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
quite interesting

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
is that DMT, the mother
of all psychedelics,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
dimethyltryptamine, is
found within our own brains

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:90%
in our pineal gland.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
They say it's released
during dreams potentially,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
at birth, and death, and even
in near-death experiences.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the psychedelic experience
can be joyous and ecstatic,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and it can also be
scary and challenging,

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:84%
but every experience
is different

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:90%
for every single person.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.112 align:middle line:84%
And even every experience
that you have within yourself

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:84%
can be different
every single time.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they make possible
creative achievement and a more

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:90%
valid and intense perception?

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Or do they merely substitute
an unreal fantasy world

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
for the sometimes
harsh facts of reality?

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yes, I think that I
experience things much more

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:90%
intensely now.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt this warm fire shoot
up the right side of my body.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it just filled
me with this warmth,

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and then I look off
in the distance,

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and emerging out
of the darkness are

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.013 align:middle line:84%
these purple and green beams
that look like Aurora borealis.

00:25:26.013 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
They look like northern
lights, and they

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:90%
start waving towards me.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so these beams of light
then wrap themselves around me,

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and I look down, and
it's just like I'm

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.250 align:middle line:84%
covered in northern lights,
which was pretty cool.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And the beams then roll
me over onto my left side

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
into the fetal position.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm lying there,
feeling the most comforting,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
deep, powerful,
maternal presence

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever encountered.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was so nurturing and
comforting, and no discredit

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to my own mother, but this
was the greatest mother in all

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:90%
the universe, and I knew that.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm about to close
my eyes, and then, boom,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I hear this [CHANTING].

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's the shaman,
or [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
singing what they
call [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
They claim that it's a
song that they channel

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
from higher powers, and it's not
really of their own creation.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And they use it to guide
those who drink the ayahuasca

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:90%
through their experience.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And as he's singing it,
these orange and blue shapes

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
are emanating from his
mouth, and just expanding

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.330 align:middle line:84%
across the room,
and just filling

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
my entire perceptual field
like this gigantic cloud.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
these three beings

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
float into the right side
of my perceptual field,

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and I call them humanoids.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
They were about two
and a half feet tall,

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and all three of them
were just expressing love.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was all telepathic.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They were just imparting it
to me and filling me with it.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They start showing me all
these lessons about love

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and just loving all
things, and, for example,

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:84%
love being that it's
allowing all beings to make

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:90%
their own choices.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
As I started encountering more
and more of these spirits,

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I recognized that
they were infinite.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was like peering into a
night sky, and you see stars,

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and then you notice that there
are stars beyond the stars.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.188 align:middle line:84%
So it was like there were
spirits beyond the spirits,

00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was navigating this
realm in my consciousness

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and beyond my
consciousness, too.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It was separate
from me, and it was

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
just like I was swimming
in a sea of spirits.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And every direction I
looked it was infinite.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So psychedelics are really
interesting because they take

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:84%
you within and without in a
way that you don't normally

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
mystery, actually,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
because just from
the very basis that

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
anytime you take a
psychedelic you really

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
have no idea where
you're going to end up,

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
which is why it's so important
that, if you're going to do it,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that you do it in a
really good environment

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.575 align:middle line:84%
and among people that have a
lot of love and respect for you.

00:27:46.575 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And so where do you go?

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you go into everything.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.700 align:middle line:84%
You go into yourself and into
the environment around you

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.517 align:middle line:84%
more so than you
normally experience.

00:27:58.517 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's really quite a
remarkable experience

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.483 align:middle line:90%
from that perspective.

00:28:01.483 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's always going
to be different,

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
but it's always
going to be unique,

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
but, of course, the biggest
thing is really just

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:90%
to be safe about it.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:84%
No matter what, the environment
is just as important as what

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:90%
substance you end up taking.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the day, it really

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:21.182 align:middle line:84%
is about a truly in-depth
exploration of the self.

00:28:21.182 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, man, that's the
purpose of ayahuasca--

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.452 align:middle line:90%
to go into the unconscious.

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The person who gets scared
just means they have fear.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
ayahuasca caused fear.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.063 align:middle line:84%
It's that they already have fear
that ayahuasca is taking them

00:28:31.063 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:90%
into.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So what they describe as a
bad trip is their inability

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
to integrate what
ayahuasca's showing them,

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.560 align:middle line:84%
which is their
unconscious, which

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:84%
was their fear, which
is their shadow.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.555 align:middle line:84%
So if they've come to ayahuasca
to feel and light love,

00:28:47.555 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
you're not ready
to take ayahuasca,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:90%
because that's not what life is.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Certainly that's a part of life.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:84%
There is light and love,
but that's not all there is.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
There is also shadow, and
the shadow is our teacher.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you come to
ayahuasca, you have

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
to be absolutely committed
to learning from your shadow.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.807 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you are going to
have challenging experiences.

00:29:07.807 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the purpose of ayahuasca.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the indigenous
people have used ayahuasca.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool to become
more conscious.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:90%
So that fear comes up.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.332 align:middle line:84%
Now you're conscious
of the fear.

00:29:18.332 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:90%
That's not a bad thing.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
thing, but you have

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to be ready to work with
it and integrate it.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I was actually in
Boracay in the Philippines,

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and a girl from Brooklyn,
who was a shaman, knew--

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:84%
we were friends, and
she knew my problems.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:84%
She actually tried
to work on me before.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And she saw on
Facebook I was there,

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and she was going to
a retreat in Cebu.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And she stopped in at
me, and she said, hey,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
there's this guy that I
knew who was just like you.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
he was even worse.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
hard to believe,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:90%
but she said he was even worse.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And he went to do
this plant medicine,

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and did the plant medicine one
time, and he changed his life.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.148 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:30:01.148 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:90%
I tried everything else.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm scared shit of
doing plant medicine.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm scared to death of some
kind of crazy trip or something

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm scared to
do it, but I'm done.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:90%
It's my last chance.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
The way this medicine works
is a little bit different.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:84%
He gives you the medicine, and
then gives you a blindfold,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and he taps you on
the tip of the head,

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and tells you when
you can-- says

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.273 align:middle line:90%
tell me when you see my finger.

00:30:25.273 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about to say, well,
I can't see your finger,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:90%
because I have this blind--

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:90%
I see your finger.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.700 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
saw the dude's finger.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I
have a blindfold on.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I know I have a blindfold on.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in Kansas anymore.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even really
believe in god.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I was in church
every day in my life,

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
believe in god.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.475 align:middle line:84%
God for me was a side bet
in case shit went wrong.

00:30:47.475 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
If it was, I genuflected
here and there,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.213 align:middle line:84%
and said some prayers
just in case it was real.

00:30:52.213 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:90%
I had no feeling towards it.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.125 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, I'm looking,
and I see this guy's hand.

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And he says, look
at the ceiling.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.417 align:middle line:90%
I look at the ceiling.

00:30:58.417 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:90%
He goes, look.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And I see the ceiling.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Look through the ceiling.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I looked
through the ceiling.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And he said, do you see stars?

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, jump to a star.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And I jumped to a
star, and I was flying.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.455 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what the
hell is going on here?

00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:90%
He said, look to your left.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.413 align:middle line:90%
Do you see the moon?

00:31:14.413 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And I looked to my left.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I see the moon.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:90%
He said, go to it.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the moon,
and I couldn't slow down.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And I dove into the
moon, and my feet

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:90%
were sticking out of the moon.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.395 align:middle line:90%
And that's the truth.

00:31:25.395 --> 00:31:27.228 align:middle line:84%
The whole time you're
talking to the shaman,

00:31:27.228 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:84%
telling him what's going on,
and he's telling you what to do.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.947 align:middle line:90%
So you have these things on.

00:31:30.947 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:84%
This experience
has happened to you

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I guess like virtual reality.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
This is happening to
you, yet I'm hearing him

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.115 align:middle line:90%
and communicating with him.

00:31:37.115 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in both places.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what's my
first-- because you give him

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
10 questions, and
he writes him down.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, why am I so effed up?

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:90%
That was my first question.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, my soul turns
into the three year old me.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:90%
He's holding my hand.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking a baby into
a house, and as soon

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:84%
as I get around the
house, I can smell food.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It smells like turkey.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
There's Bing Crosby
music playing.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:90%
There's snow outside.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:02.978 align:middle line:90%
It's around Christmas.

00:32:02.978 --> 00:32:04.020 align:middle line:90%
There's a Christmas tree.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I smell pine needles and shit.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And I get the immediate
feeling that shit's not right.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I go with the kid, and
I see a stain that I made.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I would never remember
making a stain at two years,

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
but when I saw it with my kid,
with my me, I go, holy shit.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.400 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I remember doing that and
making this stain on the wall.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a cranberry
juice stain on the wall.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we walk in to
the thing, and we're

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:84%
going to this coat closet, and
he's telling me where to go,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:90%
like pointing.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
see the coat closet,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I know things are going to get
probably worse at this point.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I open the coat closet,
and my grandfather

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
has his penis all over me as
a kid, the three year old boy.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, oh, well to me
that explains a lot of things.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, that's
why I'm so crazy.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why I can't
connect with women.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why I can't
connect with dudes.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't really connect.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I was so shut down.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was the best
night of my life.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.530 align:middle line:90%
So the things I saw--

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I found out what
was wrong with me,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was just in such
awe the whole time.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was a crazy, crazy
thing, and then the next day I

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:90%
no longer wanted--

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I quit smoking cigarettes.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:90%
I could drink.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I was drinking 10 drinks a day.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I could drink two drinks
and not drink another drink.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to start eating better.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do these
things, and not

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:90%
that I was trying to do them.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to do them.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.356 align:middle line:90%
Something in me changed.

00:33:36.356 --> 00:33:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The human brain, after
all, is made for thinking,

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.440 align:middle line:90%
not fumigating.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It's hardly a tinker toy for
experimenting with drugs.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
public service message

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.480 align:middle line:84%
of the American
Medical Association

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and your local station.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's extremely hard to
speak about the experiences

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics or plant
medicines to somebody who has

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.970 align:middle line:90%
no experience.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:84%
The best way to describe
an ayahuasca experience

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.989 align:middle line:84%
or a mushroom experience
is to take the tea

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:14.659 align:middle line:84%
or to take the mushroom, because
so much of the experience

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:84%
is inexpressible,
is ineffable, which

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is why we spend so
much time coming up

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.517 align:middle line:90%
with language for these things.

00:34:22.517 --> 00:34:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Although it's very difficult
to describe what a psychedelic

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.642 align:middle line:84%
vision looks like, there have
been artists who have been able

00:34:27.642 --> 00:34:32.145 align:middle line:84%
to recreate somewhat accurate
depictions of these visions.

00:34:32.145 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I also found it
quite interesting

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.020 align:middle line:84%
when I heard about a guy by
the name of Shawn Thornton.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.457 align:middle line:84%
Shawn was an artist who
had pineal gland cancer.

00:34:38.457 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the gland response
for the production

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.350 align:middle line:90%
of DMT within our brains.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, these mental effects
to the confirmed LSD user,

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
to the evangelist, if you
will, are felt to be religious,

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful, and godlike,
perhaps because they expect

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:90%
them to be.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Realistically speaking, they
are nothing more nor less

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.339 align:middle line:90%
than a period of insanity.

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So where does spirituality
come into all this?

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you have a
spiritual experience

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:90%
through a psychedelic?

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:84%
The question was of
such great curiosity

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
that Harvard actually conducted
two experiments, one of them

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
called the Good
Friday experiment.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The other was done by
someone named Walter Pahnke.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.648 align:middle line:84%
They concluded
that, yes, you could

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:84%
have a spiritual
experience through the use

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.730 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelics.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it also
lasted a very long time

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
after the experiment
had taken place.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I read a book
by Robert Muller,

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and he was the Assistant
Secretary General of the United

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Nations.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And the book was
called "New Genesis--

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Shaping a Global Spirituality."

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a brilliant
book, and I wrote him a letter.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I really
was moved by your book,

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have a
word about psychedelics.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote to Robert Muller,
and I told him about the Good

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Friday experiment.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, right now MDMA
is a psychedelic drug.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:90%
I'd learned about it in '82.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:90%
In '84, it was still legal.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's still legal.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And would you be willing
to help open the door

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.835 align:middle line:90%
to psychedelic research?

00:36:36.835 --> 00:36:38.460 align:middle line:84%
A college undergraduate
gets his letter

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.918 align:middle line:84%
from the Assistant Secretary
General of the United Nations.

00:36:40.918 --> 00:36:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
understood me perfectly,

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and I do think that
psychedelics could be helpful.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I will help you
to try to bring back

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.090 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic research,
and here's a bunch

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
of people who are in
the spiritual traditions

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that I'd be interested to
know what they have to say.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of read between
the lines, and I heard him say,

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:90%
mail them MDMA.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So this was Brother
David Steindl-Rast,

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:90%
who's a Roman Catholic monk--

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Vanja Palmers, who
is head of the zen

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.120 align:middle line:90%
community in Switzerland--

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Teasdale,
a Catholic monk--

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Rabbi Zalman Schachter,
who was an orthodox rabbi.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So MDMA was legal, so
I mailed them MDMA.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.170 align:middle line:90%
And one of them--

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Brother David Steindl-Rast--
took it in the monastery.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.672 align:middle line:84%
Other people took it in
their religious practices,

00:37:26.672 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and then they wrote
back to Robert Muller

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, MDMA
really can be helpful.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of confirmed for me
this theory of social change--

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that if people can
have experiences

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality and mysticism,
whether by psychedelics

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.240 align:middle line:90%
or not--

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:90%
other means are fine, too--

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that is a strategy
towards peace.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And that reaffirmed
my commitment

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to bringing psychedelics back
and trying to mainstream them

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:90%
into Western culture.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> People are not finding
meaningful experience within

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:90%
our culture--

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
meaningful spiritual
experience within our culture.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:90%
People have a longing for that.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many people
from traditional faiths,

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.550 align:middle line:84%
whether they be, let's say,
of the monotheistic variety,

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
the Abrahamic traditions of
Judaism, Christianity, Islam,

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:84%
who have participated in
ayahuasca ceremonies and have

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:84%
found that it has
deepened their faith,

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:28.800 align:middle line:84%
because it has given them a
direct personal experience

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:36.240 align:middle line:84%
of who knows what-- the Virgin
Mary, Jesus, different saints,

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.560 align:middle line:84%
or just a feeling of being
embraced by the Holy Spirit.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people
have said that

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
all major religious
traditions have at their root

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.180 align:middle line:90%
a psychedelic beginning.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> God created the brain in such
a way to be able to communicate

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:84%
with us, and this goes a long
way in explaining why there is,

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:90%
for example, DMT in the brain--

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that it helps
mediate the visions

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%
which God uses to communicate
certain information to us.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And that information can be
evolutionarily useful or not.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It might be psychologically
useful or not.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that they
have been used for thousands

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:84%
of years is to help people
have spiritual experiences.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And the essence of the spiritual
experience is a sense of unity,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:84%
a sense that we're
all connected,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.120 align:middle line:84%
a sense that there
is one larger system.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.860 align:middle line:84%
We're on the planet
in the universe.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And then if you can
feel that, then people

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that are different from you are
actually more similar to you

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:90%
than different.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of
the human family,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and if you can identify as part
of the human family instead

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of my country, my religion,
my race, my gender,

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.090 align:middle line:84%
my sexual orientation,
all these different ways

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.820 align:middle line:90%
that we subdivide ourselves--

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that if people could
have a deeper connection

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:84%
to life itself, to the
planet, to everybody,

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that then that would be
the ground at which peace

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.710 align:middle line:90%
could be made.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The UNESCO charter
says that, since wars

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.400 align:middle line:84%
begin in the minds of men,
it's in the minds of men

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.488 align:middle line:84%
that the defenses of
peace must be constructed.

00:40:20.488 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So this DMT that's
inside of our brains,

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.940 align:middle line:90%
this natural psychedelic--

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:90%
I was really curious.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.180 align:middle line:90%
How do we access it?

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:90%
So I went on a quest.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I started exploring
different methods.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:02.670 align:middle line:90%
I tried meditating.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I did crazy
breathing techniques.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I went to go train with Wim
Hof and learn his breathing

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And we jumped in frozen lakes,
and I went out into the cold.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I also participated
in Inipi ceremonies,

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Native American sweat lodges.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.540 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I went
on a fast for 55 days.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I lost over 40 pounds, and at
some points during that fast, I

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.930 align:middle line:90%
would not eat or drink water.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So I dry fasted for up
to 100 hours straight.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And on this quest, I reached
many different altered states

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
nowhere near where

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I had reached with ayahuasca
or any of the psychedelics,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.860 align:middle line:84%
but there was something there,
but it just wasn't exactly

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.660 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's how I would explain
the difference between taking

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:84%
a plant medicine or any medicine
in order to open yourself up,

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and doing it through
breathing and movement.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.960 align:middle line:84%
By the way, shamans have
been using breathing,

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and movement, and
dance, [CHANTING],,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:84%
drumming, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.060 align:middle line:90%
rattles.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They've been using sound
and movement in order

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:84%
to alter their states
of consciousness

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:84%
so that they could receive
information about how to heal

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.300 align:middle line:90%
others from the very beginning.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say that plant
medicines weren't a part of it,

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:21.200 align:middle line:84%
but that is to say that they
also understood and took

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:84%
great care to get into the
intelligence of the body

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:84%
by opening it up with
vibration, movement,

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and breathing in
order to expand--

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.970 align:middle line:84%
you know when you take
the medicine and, boom,

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.380 align:middle line:90%
you're waking up the things?

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, shamans have
been doing that

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.440 align:middle line:84%
for generations with
just movement, breathing,

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and vibration-- sound.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
experience that first.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I was able to experience
opening up through movement,

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.150 align:middle line:84%
breathing, sound in the
same way that a shaman

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.290 align:middle line:90%
would in that way.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And I had my experience.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I had my evolution.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I had all the gifts that
were available to me,

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:84%
many of which sound a lot like
what people who have used plant

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:84%
medicine experience
and describe,

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:84%
which are the visions, which are
the downloads of insight, which

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
are the dreams that show up
days and weeks afterwards.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden it's almost like
there is a-- it's interesting

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:90%
that I go here.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:84%
There is an opening--
a third eye opening,

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and you start seeing things
that you couldn't see before.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:90%
The insights are there.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.270 align:middle line:84%
By using bioenergetics,
active breathing,

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:40.580 align:middle line:84%
active meditation over the
course of three years--

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:46.130 align:middle line:84%
it had been a process for me,
where slowly I'm opening up

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:90%
to states of consciousness.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Slowly I'm tippy toeing
into different dimensions.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Slowly I'm receiving the
right information for me

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:84%
at the right time
for my evolution

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.100 align:middle line:90%
over the course of years.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.778 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.778 --> 00:44:05.070 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I could change
my state of consciousness

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.237 align:middle line:84%
now with just a little bit
of drumming, a little bit

00:44:07.237 --> 00:44:08.740 align:middle line:90%
of yelling and acting out.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I could work myself
into that type of state.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.460 align:middle line:84%
When I experienced
the plant medicine,

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and when I speak to
people who use it,

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:84%
it's like going from walking
around to waking up instantly,

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:31.670 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to walking around and
slowly waking up to yourself.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.760 align:middle line:84%
One way I like to describe
the difference between the two

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.890 align:middle line:84%
is active meditation
and bioenergetics

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is like if you can imagine
you're in a block of ice.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.590 align:middle line:84%
We're all frozen in
our block of ice.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Active breathing is
like the sun slowly

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:84%
melting, and know you're
starting to move a little bit.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You got a little
bit more motility.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin, the ice
melts, and you begin to open up,

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.500 align:middle line:90%
and then you become alive.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:84%
The plant medicine
is like you're

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.420 align:middle line:84%
in that same block of ice, and
someone takes a sledgehammer

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and goes, bang!

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And cracks you wide open.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot of people
end up going a little crazy--

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.830 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
prepared for it.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I would say, if you're
going to use plant medicine,

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.460 align:middle line:84%
begin with months
of meditation first.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.800 align:middle line:84%
That way you're familiar
with the emotions

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.270 align:middle line:90%
that are going to arise.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when they
take that plant medicine,

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.350 align:middle line:90%
there's fear.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:90%
There's uncontrollable sobbing.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.310 align:middle line:84%
There's all this
emotional reaction

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that they don't know
where it's coming from,

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's been trapped
in their body.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They're just open to it now,
and it can be very scary.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you use
active meditation,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:84%
you get in touch with your body
in the way I'm describing now

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.970 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
a few months first,

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:53.480 align:middle line:84%
you will begin to open
up slowly and process

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the junk that's
laying on the surface

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:84%
first, so that when you do
take the plant medicine,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.380 align:middle line:84%
there will be a greater
opportunity for a more

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.630 align:middle line:90%
enlightening experience.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I started
doing breath work,

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I started to notice that we
could access certain states

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:15.890 align:middle line:84%
of mind and certain states of
consciousness that normally

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to be achieved
by just a natural practice,

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and that I could achieve
them pretty easily and pretty

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.732 align:middle line:90%
effectively.

00:46:22.732 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:84%
What I find really
interesting about this

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.450 align:middle line:84%
is that I've been teaching
this stuff all over the world,

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and I've been meeting
so many people

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.112 align:middle line:84%
from so many
different practices.

00:46:31.112 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times they tell
me, when I do the breath

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:90%
work with them--

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's important.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.810 align:middle line:84%
You can't just hyperventilate
and dive into this stuff.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to do
this in a proper setting

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:84%
in a safe way with
proper guidance,

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:84%
but whenever I do
this with people

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and they get into this
state, a lot of times

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.460 align:middle line:84%
afterwards they say
things to me like I've

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.230 align:middle line:90%
been on an ayahuasca journey.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a very
similar experience.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.963 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody says I've
had an LSD experience,

00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and this was a
very similar thing.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Or they said I have been in
a sensory deprivation tank

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.130 align:middle line:84%
for so many hours, and I
had a similar experience.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:11.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we
refer to this kind

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:84%
of breathing as DMT
reading, and this simply

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:19.100 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the shared
experiences with people

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of which they know
that they've had

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.630 align:middle line:84%
DMT in their system-- so
with ayahuasca or even

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.490 align:middle line:90%
smoking actual DMT.

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And people would describe
these experiences,

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and these would be
extremely similar--

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.420 align:middle line:84%
so the kind of
things that people

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.520 align:middle line:84%
see, the kind of
revelations that they have,

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.240 align:middle line:84%
the kind of connection
they feel to the universe

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.120 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to call it--

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.510 align:middle line:84%
but also the kind of
change that they would feel

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.280 align:middle line:90%
in their daily life afterwards.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So during those very
deep breathing sessions,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:84%
people a longtime
afterwards would say it's

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.000 align:middle line:84%
changed me in a profound way in
a very similar way as to what

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:90%
people say when they use DMT.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Meditation, drumming,
ecstatic dance,

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:84%
sensory deprivation tanks,
sound healing therapies--

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.070 align:middle line:84%
all have been known or reported
to create altered states

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:14.210 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness similar to a
DMT or psychedelic experience.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:18.070 align:middle line:90%


00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So what did I find
out after trying

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.010 align:middle line:84%
all these different
modalities, trying

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to access altered
states of consciousness.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I got to some pretty
interesting places,

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
but nowhere close to where
I had been on psychedelics.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I need to try
them a little bit longer

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.290 align:middle line:84%
or dedicate myself
a little bit more.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes some of
these practices

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.630 align:middle line:84%
might take 10, 20, or
30 years to achieve

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.820 align:middle line:84%
those states of what
they might describe

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.550 align:middle line:90%
as enlightenment or nirvana.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.213 align:middle line:84%
But one thing is
for certain-- is

00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that it seems like
we're all climbing up

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.172 align:middle line:84%
different sides of a pyramid
trying to get to that top,

00:48:50.172 --> 00:48:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to that altered state.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the psychedelic
is just a shortcut.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just a faster way
to get to that same place.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Some guys who have
gone the other route

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.862 align:middle line:84%
said, that once they
did try psychedelics,

00:49:02.862 --> 00:49:04.320 align:middle line:84%
it did take them
to a similar state

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.737 align:middle line:84%
that they had achieved through
either meditative or breath

00:49:06.737 --> 00:49:07.537 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:49:07.537 --> 00:49:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think we are going
to the same place.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.920 align:middle line:84%
We're just taking
a different route.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So transformation-- the effects
of psychedelics on people

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.520 align:middle line:84%
sometimes are so profound
that it's almost like nothing

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:90%
short of a miracle.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.700 align:middle line:84%
People who have been in
such a dark place for so

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.000 align:middle line:84%
long, whether it's with
addiction, depression, anxiety,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:84%
you name it, and in one night
or in just a couple of sessions,

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:90%
their life is changed forever.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people say they got more
in one night of a plant medicine

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.260 align:middle line:84%
ceremony than they had in
30 years of psychotherapy

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.100 align:middle line:90%
or with a psychiatrist.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I came to Canada in 2000.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So basically I didn't
speak during the week.

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.370 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't easy.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was growing up
with my mom in Toronto,

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and I would have
visitation with my father.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I remember probably taking
my first drink from him

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:84%
when I was about seven
or eight, around there.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It was oftentimes when
I was with him when

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.040 align:middle line:90%
I was in unsafe situations.

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.520 align:middle line:84%
If I took a sip of his drink,
or sometimes he would just

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:90%
give me a little brandy--

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.630 align:middle line:84%
that it would put me
at ease and comfort.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.060 align:middle line:84%
My mom worked hard
to support us.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.010 align:middle line:84%
My dad wasn't there
for us financially.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was put with a
lot of babysitters.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I was-- sexual abuse
issues and feeling really,

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.120 align:middle line:90%
really, really unsafe.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd always sort of
had a sensitive body,

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:04.830 align:middle line:90%
but I was fully functional.

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I had been working a lot.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I worked at Harvard Medical
School, but one day I woke up

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was just in
incredible pain.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that the
day before that, in a way,

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.020 align:middle line:90%
was the last day of my life.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get out of
bed because of pain.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I had gone to a series
of very top doctors.

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I was sent to specialist
after specialist.

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And they kept
making predictions,

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and they kept coming out wrong.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Someone said to
me, you have to be

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.300 align:middle line:90%
your own doctor at one point.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
doing my own research,

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and they took a blood test.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And they checked almost
every box on the list,

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the rheumatologist
can we check for scleroderma?

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Because luckily, unlike a
lot of these other diseases,

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.420 align:middle line:90%
there's a test for it.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And after six months, I
found my own diagnosis,

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:84%
which is scleroderma, an
autoimmune disease, which

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.260 align:middle line:84%
hardens the connective
tissue in your body, which

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.140 align:middle line:90%
holds your body together.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.930 align:middle line:90%
So I slowly turned into a mummy.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> About three years down the
road of hard work and virtually

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:28.500 align:middle line:84%
imbalanced lifestyle-- it's
work, work, work, study, study,

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.370 align:middle line:90%
study--

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:32.040 align:middle line:90%
one night it all exploded.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I basically woke up in
the morning about 5:00 AM,

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and just feeling so
bizarre and weird,

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and it was like everything
was spinning around.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I basically was
losing my breath.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.915 align:middle line:84%
So later on, I realized that
it was a severe panic attack.

00:52:46.915 --> 00:52:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to make of it.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It was basically
so overwhelming.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then basically that
shifted everything in my life.

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.690 align:middle line:90%
I lost sleep completely.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The anxiety attacks were
going one after another--

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like an
avalanche, day after day.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Suffering during the day, not
sleeping during the night,

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.310 align:middle line:90%
thinking the craziest thoughts.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:09.590 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts were
coming by themselves.

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Things really started
getting weird.

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:15.020 align:middle line:84%
My blood pressure
dropped like 60 to 80.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.720 align:middle line:90%
My pulse went up over 100.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.655 align:middle line:84%
Always tired and not be able to
relax, or sleep, or anything.

00:53:21.655 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So finally I just
realized, yeah,

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I need to go to the doctor.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, the doctor looked
at me and said, you're fine.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:30.260 align:middle line:84%
You're just going--
like many people

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.270 align:middle line:90%
are going through stress.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Many immigrants do
go through that,

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.120 align:middle line:90%
but everything's fine with you.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
get it together.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.580 align:middle line:90%
He didn't offer me anything.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.050 align:middle line:84%
He didn't offer
me any counseling.

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:84%
He didn't offer me
anything at all.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.370 align:middle line:84%
It was like I left
the office virtually

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.580 align:middle line:84%
with the same knowledge
that I entered the office.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I just realized that I no
longer can support life.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I can no longer
be in the family.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So I declared to
my wife that I'm

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:58.970 align:middle line:84%
leaving, that we
need to separate,

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's taking
too much on me.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I totally started losing
it, started getting into all

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.560 align:middle line:90%
sorts of conflicts at work.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They let me go.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I worked for the bank for
four years, a very good place.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I went for welfare and
started getting food

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:16.160 align:middle line:90%
from Salvation Army.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you know
any notion of what

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.060 align:middle line:84%
it is to be out of your
mind, that was what I was.

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.040 align:middle line:90%
It was like a mental hospital.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.840 align:middle line:90%
People are there.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.290 align:middle line:90%
They are walking.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Lights are there,
but nobody's home.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I found myself by age
11 sneaking into the bar,

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and pouring a little bit of
this and a little bit of that.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Then I started with weed,
and that got into cocaine.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I came back to Toronto
and was introduced

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to-- was looking
to score cocaine

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.100 align:middle line:90%
and was introduced to heroin.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And that was really--

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.370 align:middle line:84%
that I would say of
my drug of choice.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
went by the wayside.

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't interested in
more alcohol and cocaine.

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:58.730 align:middle line:84%
As my addiction progressed,
it was very easy

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:01.940 align:middle line:84%
for me to slip
into prostitution.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I was not high functioning--
definitely not.

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.320 align:middle line:84%
That was my primary
relationship--

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.050 align:middle line:84%
100%-- was my
relationship with my drug.

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I could only facilitate
that by having relationships

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.840 align:middle line:90%
that made that possible.

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> School ended.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything ended, and
that became my life.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It ended up me getting arrested,
and I got put on methadone.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Being in methadone
clinics for 17, 18 years,

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really see
anybody getting off of it.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.920 align:middle line:84%
It is widely prescribed,
and I didn't see anybody

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.540 align:middle line:84%
getting off of it
without going back

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:47.490 align:middle line:84%
on either some kind of either
prescription opiate or street

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.290 align:middle line:90%
drug.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:52.100 align:middle line:84%
They were going to do a year
long thing for me, which

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.340 align:middle line:84%
was like four months
or three months

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.060 align:middle line:84%
to build me up to a place that
would hold me, and then keep me

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:02.045 align:middle line:84%
there for six months,
and then three months

00:56:02.045 --> 00:56:02.920 align:middle line:90%
to take me off of it.

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:07.852 align:middle line:84%
It keeps the drug user in
an active form of addiction,

00:56:07.852 --> 00:56:09.560 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
wake up every morning

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and take it to feel normal.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.550 align:middle line:84%
That one year turned into
many, many, many years.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.670 align:middle line:84%
With addiction, you have to
be at a point of readiness,

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and most people are forced into
going on methadone because they

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:26.720 align:middle line:84%
can't afford their drug anymore,
or they're in legal trouble,

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.000 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to
lose their child.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.497 align:middle line:84%
So it's not them making
a conscious decision

00:56:31.497 --> 00:56:32.330 align:middle line:90%
that, you know what?

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I've reached a point of
willingness, and readiness,

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and this is the way that
I can get to clarity.

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been clean and
sober since August 11,

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.930 align:middle line:90%
2005 besides the methadone.

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I got off street
drugs and alcohol.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I understand,
you get maybe 10 years maximum

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to live, and it's a
very painful way to go.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I was in tremendous pain,
and I was bedridden.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I traveled by
stretcher by ambulance

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.840 align:middle line:84%
for three to four
years, and I was

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.040 align:middle line:90%
told that there was no hope.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I think at one point I
was taking 32 pills a day.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.780 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was going to die.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I was very close to death
for a very long time.

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And the pain was tremendous.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't sleep for
maybe two years.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Even tucking in a sheet
was too much weight.

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So I was sort of like a
cadaver, and they would just

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.390 align:middle line:90%
lay the sheet over me.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I contacted a place
in the United States

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.797 align:middle line:84%
with nurses who will sit
with you while you euthanize.

00:57:36.797 --> 00:57:37.630 align:middle line:90%
They won't help you.

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.210 align:middle line:84%
That's not legal, but they'll
be in the room with you

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:41.180 align:middle line:90%
while you do it.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So I was really looking for a
Hail Mary pass at that point.

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I started to look actively
for help outside the medical

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.080 align:middle line:90%
establishment.

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So I started-- because
I'm a software developer,

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and I do a lot of internet, so
internet is like home for me.

00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So I started browsing.

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I started finding people
with similar stories,

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and then I met a lady
who became my friend,

00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:07.720 align:middle line:90%
my girlfriend, Natalie.

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So she introduced
me to cannabis,

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and that was, to
me, the first point

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that I actually
learned that there

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:28.210 align:middle line:84%
was hope, because after
I tried it, I fell asleep

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:32.410 align:middle line:84%
after about four or
five years of insomnia.

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:37.090 align:middle line:84%
All I needed from my doctor,
whom I talked to five years

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:41.660 align:middle line:84%
previous to that experience--
the doctor who has been trained

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:46.280 align:middle line:84%
to understand humans, to relieve
them from their suffering--

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.410 align:middle line:84%
did not talk to me
about the existence

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of healing cannabis,
which is known

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:55.700 align:middle line:90%
to heal stress and insomnia.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to go
through all the conflict--

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to lose my family, to
lose everything, my job--

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.720 align:middle line:84%
to meet that lady who is not a
doctor at all, who doesn't even

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.440 align:middle line:84%
have a bachelor
education, but she gave me

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.040 align:middle line:90%
the gift of cannabis.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And I fell asleep.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> At that point I
thought that I was clean.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.020 align:middle line:90%
My life changed so much.

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I went to my 13th
treatment center.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.890 align:middle line:84%
All this time they're saying
they're bringing doctors

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.170 align:middle line:84%
into all these places to
prescribe me my methadone,

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying,
well, maybe I should

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.450 align:middle line:90%
start tapering my methadone.

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, are you kidding?

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:33.873 align:middle line:84%
Just look where
you've come from.

00:59:33.873 --> 00:59:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Look what you've done.

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Just think of this
as your insulin.

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:90%
This is just your medication.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.110 align:middle line:84%
This is prescribed, and
this is your medication.

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Just be grateful for
where you've come from.

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:46.280 align:middle line:90%
You're a miracle.

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So I met my husband
in 12 step rooms.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He's a recovering addict,
alcoholic, as well--

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.640 align:middle line:90%
my now husband.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.377 align:middle line:84%
And we became
really good friends.

00:59:54.377 --> 00:59:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I met him when I first
got out of treatment.

00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:59.320 align:middle line:84%
We were friends for years, and
we ended up getting married.

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And once we were married, I
started a pretty heavy duty

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.020 align:middle line:84%
taper of methadone,
and it took me

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to a place of psychotic breaks.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:16.040 align:middle line:84%
My brain was saying it's been
too many years, and my brain,

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
my body, my soul, my spirit
was just in absolute havoc.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I started listening to some
podcasts with a man named Dr.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Ryan, and he was the
first clear intelligent voice

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that really articulated using
psychedelics in another way,

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
in a medicinal way, because
I had only ever viewed it

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:42.410 align:middle line:84%
in a typical way that
our society treats it,

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
where I wasn't very
interested in that.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So I reached out to
Chris, and Chris said,

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know you very well, so
I'm reluctant to suggest this,

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
but if I were in your position,
I would probably do ayahuasca.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.940 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get to Peru.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even get from
my bed to my commode,

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
about a foot away from
my bed, without help.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.060 align:middle line:90%
I managed to acquire ayahuasca.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I had spoken with
Dr. Gabor Maté,

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
who has had patients
with scleroderma before,

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to give me some
advice to help me stay as safe

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:28.410 align:middle line:84%
as possible while I was doing
it, but I just couldn't move.

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I was reaching out to
all different doctors,

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:35.627 align:middle line:84%
head of psychiatry here, head
of addictions at this hospital.

01:01:35.627 --> 01:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were all telling
me the same thing.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.752 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're on a smaller dose.

01:01:38.752 --> 01:01:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't taper anymore.

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, please covet
your recovery.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Covet how far you've come.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that I couldn't.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't wake up every morning
and have to take something.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And besides that, I was nuts.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I was suicidal.

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So my husband was reaching
out to absolutely everybody--

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%
his father is a doctor.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:05.270 align:middle line:90%
His brother is a doctor.

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
They were reaching out, and
somebody told them about Gabor

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Maté.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.587 align:middle line:84%
In one week, three
people gave us his book,

01:02:11.587 --> 01:02:12.920 align:middle line:90%
"The Realm of the Hungry Ghost."

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'd seen so many doctors.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been to so
many specialists,

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and Western medicine just kept
giving me the same message--

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.170 align:middle line:90%
just stay, just stay.

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:24.253 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't talk about
psychedelics in his book

01:02:24.253 --> 01:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
at all, but what I heard was a
different compassion from him,

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
but I still didn't
reach out to him.

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
My husband sent him an email,
and said, please help my wife.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.320 align:middle line:90%
She's going to die.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.673 align:middle line:90%
She's come so far.

01:02:37.673 --> 01:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%
He happened to be in
Toronto a few days later.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:45.118 align:middle line:84%
I met with him, and he
listened to my whole story

01:02:45.118 --> 01:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and quite a lot of details, said
very little, and at the end,

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.243 align:middle line:84%
he said, I think I
have a way that you

01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%
can save your own life.

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of months
later, I went to Mexico,

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and I did my first
ayahuasca ceremony.

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> With ayahuasca, I
realized that I finally found

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the teacher that
I needed in life.

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca
knocked on my heart.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things of the mind--
the mind just shut down.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The mind, after that
night, was quiet.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.800 align:middle line:90%
It became quiet.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It stopped rambling about
small things, about whatever it

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
was rumbling before,
about unreasonable things,

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
endless stories,
endless scenarios.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It eliminated all
panic attacks, so I

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.870 align:middle line:90%
have no panic attacks anymore.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%
I have no anxiety anymore.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how
it's possible for me

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
now to have them.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
somebody takes a book,

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and reads about
it with this mind,

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and makes some kind
of conclusion--

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.690 align:middle line:90%
logical conclusion.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a direct
experiential learning.

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>> What can I say?

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
That's where the real
life changing began.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:01.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not an escape.

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything I used was
to numb and to escape.

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Any plant medicine,
any plant teaching

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
is going to teach you truth,
and clarity, and connection.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's the exact
opposite of what I

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:20.120 align:middle line:90%
was seeking for so many years.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You can come back from the pain
that you've been running from.

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:27.155 align:middle line:90%
You can stop running.

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And this has helped me do it.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I have liver disease.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I have Hepatitis C, and I've
never been treated for it.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca brought my counts
right down from very high to

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
in the normal average range
of a healthy human being.

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I also didn't have
my menstruation cycle

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years, and they said
to me, you're perimenopausal.

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:53.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming back.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about it kind
of a thing-- to working

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
with a shaman, and he said
to me-- after a ceremony,

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
he said, Lisa, you have
three spirits in your womb,

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and you have to release them.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said three spirits?

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, did you ever
have any abortions?

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, I had two.

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, I
think you had three.

01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, Dave,
I had two, but anyways.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
He said, I need you over
these next few ceremonies

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
to really pray on it,
and every day meditate,

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and tell them why you
couldn't parent them, and why

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
you had to do what you
did, and the place that you

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
were in when you did it, and
try and let them be at peace,

01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and go.

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think
after they leave

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
your period could come back.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And I was just looking at him.

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I had just started
ayahuasca and started

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
working with the shaman,
and I was like, OK.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm just hearing my
addiction specialist's voice.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, just trust, just trust,
just trust, just trust.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like OK.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So I worked on this
over a two week period.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
I did about 10 ceremonies.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.800 align:middle line:90%
I'd done nine ceremonies.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I was leaving the next morning
from Mexico on a 7:30 AM water

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:04.910 align:middle line:90%
taxi.

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And he came to me, and he said,
Lisa, we worked really hard.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.875 align:middle line:84%
He said we need to do one
more ceremony tonight.

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a
private ceremony for you.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
There's still one release
that has to happen.

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:16.970 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I can't do it.

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I got to go back to
my life tomorrow,

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and there's absolutely no way.

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, I ended up trusting
and doing this last ceremony.

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And after the ceremony, he
said, OK, our work is done.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was flying
home on the plane,

01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and after 20 years of no
cycle, I went to the washroom,

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.700 align:middle line:90%
and I had my period.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And I've had it ever since.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So I came home, and I
told my mom this story.

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:44.962 align:middle line:84%
And I told her
the story exactly.

01:06:44.962 --> 01:06:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I only
had two abortions.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, Lisa, you don't
remember at the very end.

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:52.340 align:middle line:90%
You had three.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Talk about trust.

01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I tried it for the first
time at the end of 2013,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and the first time I drank
I could stand up and walk,

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and the pain was gone.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.210 align:middle line:90%
It was just gone.

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:09.080 align:middle line:90%
I threw up a lot.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.640 align:middle line:90%
It was very painful.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It was very violent, but it was
very difficult to do it alone.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
After two years, I was well
enough to travel and finally

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:24.580 align:middle line:90%
get to a real shaman.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've been working
with him since December,

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:29.935 align:middle line:90%
so about six months.

01:07:29.935 --> 01:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I was so used
to being numbed.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I had no relationship
with my body.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I had no relationship
with my spirit.

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I was just vacant, and
ayahuasca showed me

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
who I am, who I was meant
to be, reconnected me with

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:59.180 align:middle line:90%
my self, my soul, my life force.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.730 align:middle line:84%
That flame that was always
flickering inside me--

01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
as much as I tried
to snub it out--

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and I tried hard--

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
it brought it to a
full burning torch.

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
ayahuasca is, after I've

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
had a painful,
painful time, it shows

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
me the most incredible
light that I didn't even

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.399 align:middle line:84%
know existed, and
light, and connection.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that's what
it is-- it's connection.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It's connection with my physical
body, my emotional body.

01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Without question, knowing
that I'm connected

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:40.130 align:middle line:90%
to something bigger, greater.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:41.899 align:middle line:90%
Without any doubt.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:43.850 align:middle line:90%
I have no doubt now.

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it was a
rebirthing, because I know

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:51.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of something bigger.

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, any type of healing,
including ayahuasca, where--

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.319 align:middle line:90%
true healing.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.149 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking taking
the symptoms away

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:01.520 align:middle line:90%
by medication or surgery.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
True healing-- it,
number one, takes time.

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's a transformation.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So ayahuasca will go into
the root of the illness,

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's always tied in
with some type of trauma

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:20.010 align:middle line:90%
that we hold.

01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
complicated healing.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting in touch
with what's present in your body

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
now, what you hold from
decades prior, or years prior.

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.529 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of letting that go,

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
but we hold it.

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.585 align:middle line:90%
We hold it, and we resist it.

01:09:36.585 --> 01:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> My colleagues-- my medical
colleagues would say, well,

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that's an anecdotal
piece of evidence.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's anecdotal.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.437 align:middle line:84%
There's no long term
controlled studies of ayahuasca

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:51.770 align:middle line:90%
in the treatment of scleroderma.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, how could that possibly be
when it's an illegal substance?

01:09:55.970 --> 01:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But there are other stories
like this, plenty of them,

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and I happen to believe in
the power of human experience.

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And I know.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it with
other conditions.

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I've treated people with severe
inflammatory bowel disease

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.340 align:middle line:84%
who can get off their
medications after the ayahuasca

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.690 align:middle line:90%
experience.

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I know people with
rheumatoid arthritis

01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
whose doctors had given up on
them, who are off medications.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes, these are anecdotes,
but at least it

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
means that we should be taking
them seriously and studying it.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion-- and I would also
say according to the very well

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
established research evidence,
all chronic illnesses,

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
with the exception of a very few
genetically determined ones--

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
all chronic illnesses, whether
it's mental illness like ADHD,

01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
which I have been diagnosed
with, or addiction,

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
or depression, or psychosis,
or the physical illnesses

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
like the autoimmune
conditions, cancer, and so on--

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
they're all relatable to
early childhood emotion

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.320 align:middle line:90%
or loss and their consequences.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's more and
more evidence about that,

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and not only early childhood,
but even what happens in utero.

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So it also means that,
if you can understand

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
the connections-- and there's
a tremendous literature now

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
showing not the connection,
but the unity of mind and body.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.390 align:middle line:84%
A recent study out in Virginia
just last week about--

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
turns out that the brain
is totally connected

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
to the immune system.

01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The emotions are connected
to the immune system.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not new,
but it was big news,

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because people
didn't know about it.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%
But again, more proof--

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:50.160 align:middle line:90%
thousands of research articles.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So given that the emotional
system, and the immune system,

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and the nervous system,
and the hormonal apparatus

01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
form one unit, it would
be stupid to suppose

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that emotional experiences have
no impact on our physiology.

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So I also noticed through
some of the studies I was

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:09.117 align:middle line:84%
looking at that, at the
root of all disease,

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
there's something
called inflammation.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.517 align:middle line:84%
Some studies were showing
that there's inflammation

01:12:13.517 --> 01:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
and depression are linked.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Some studies are also
showing that emotional trauma

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.802 align:middle line:90%
and inflammation are linked.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
a bunch of studies

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that show that psychedelics have
anti-inflammatory properties.

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a
link, but what is it?

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Does inflammation cause things
like anxiety, depression,

01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:32.450 align:middle line:90%
and maybe physical ailments?

01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a symptom of them?

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Could there be an
emotional link?

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, could emotional
trauma cause inflammation.

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Then it slowly manifests
into emotional, mental,

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and physical sickness,
like anxiety, depression,

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.580 align:middle line:90%
or even disease?

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Could it be possible, then, that
psychedelics could potentially

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
heal these emotional wounds
and potentially also reduce

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.435 align:middle line:90%
and reverse inflammation?

01:12:55.435 --> 01:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I feel a lot more research
needs to be done in this area.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:18.180 align:middle line:90%


01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
The influence of psychedelics
on modern society

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
is profound, but goes
relatively unseen.

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
It is said that Silicon Valley
was sort of inspired or founded

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.470 align:middle line:84%
with a psychedelic influence
behind it in the '60s, '50s.

01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:37.712 align:middle line:84%
Guys like Steve Jobs
said that taking LSD

01:13:37.712 --> 01:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
was a profound experience, one
of the most important things

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.250 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
LSD shows you that there's
another side to the coin.

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:45.923 align:middle line:84%
You can't remember when it
wears off, but you know it.

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It reinforced my
sense of what was

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
important-- creating great
things instead of making money,

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
putting things back into
the stream of history

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and of human consciousness
as much as I could.

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Other discoveries, like DNA and
the polymerase chain reaction,

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
were attributed to
experiences with LSD.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And even bands, like Jimi
Hendrix or the Beatles,

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
totally revolutionized their
sound through their experiences

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
with psychedelics.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Hallucinogens seem to play
the role of breaking down

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%
our perception with reality.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
That relationship is something
that we don't even see,

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:23.055 align:middle line:84%
because it's a part of
the way that we operate.

01:14:23.055 --> 01:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
times, our reactions

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.560 align:middle line:90%
aren't as obvious to us.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
We feel that they're
brought on because

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of the specific
circumstances when

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
really those specific
circumstances in our lives--

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:39.200 align:middle line:84%
they just allow for the
right conditions for us

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.020 align:middle line:84%
to express ourselves exactly
the way that we are feeling

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
in that moment,
or something that

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.920 align:middle line:90%
might be building up over time.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So taking something
like mushrooms,

01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:53.240 align:middle line:84%
or San Pedro,
ayahuasca, you name

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
it, anything that
DMT breaks down

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the typical way we see things
and opens up new patterns,

01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
new ways of seeing.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:04.780 align:middle line:90%
You listen to music on LSD.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to notice different
things in songs that you've

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.810 align:middle line:90%
heard hundreds of times.

01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Films-- you'll pick up
on different things.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
People's facial
quirks that you never

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:15.770 align:middle line:90%
notice they make all the time--

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:17.300 align:middle line:90%
you'll start noticing.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
How weird your cat
might be-- is it

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:22.307 align:middle line:90%
just because I'm on mushrooms?

01:15:22.307 --> 01:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
These types of things
start to occur to you,

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
so you start questioning a lot
of the most deeply held beliefs

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and concepts that we hold
about reality in general.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the caveat to all this
is doing it responsibly,

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
doing it medicinally,
possibly shamanically

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
has to do with something
that serves the greater good.

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'd find a hard time
serving the greater good if you

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
don't even understand the
patterns that are deeply rooted

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
in you that do not serve
you and possibly harm

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
you, the chronic addictions,
anything that we do habitually,

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.320 align:middle line:90%
rather than intentionally.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Science has not explained
what consciousness is.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It can describe
certain aspects of it,

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.810 align:middle line:90%
but explain it it cannot do.

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the brain is more like
a receiver or a transceiver

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.440 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Right now, we don't know.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's an area that
needs deep investigation,

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.460 align:middle line:90%
and you know what?

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.140 align:middle line:90%
We've got the tools to do.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.640 align:middle line:90%
We got the psychedelics.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
There is no more efficient
way to put somebody

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
into a deeply altered
state of consciousness

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and to explore what that
state of consciousness

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:39.380 align:middle line:84%
really means than something
like dimethyltryptamine, DMT.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful force.

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And right now, our society
is refusing to investigate.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It's refusing to
use psychedelics

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.635 align:middle line:84%
as a modality for investigating
the mystery of consciousness,

01:16:50.635 --> 01:16:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and that's a great mistake.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And that comes out of the
idiotic and monstrous war

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:55.730 align:middle line:90%
on drugs.

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Gradually science is
looking into new research

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
with psychedelics, looking at
their therapeutic potential,

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:05.870 align:middle line:84%
but the next big step is to
use psychedelics to investigate

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of
consciousness itself.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The larger picture--

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the role
that psychedelics

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%
will play in neuroscience,
and understanding

01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
how our brain works, and
psychotherapy, understanding

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
more healing technologies,
and in developing

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
a global spirituality,
and helping people

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.460 align:middle line:84%
be more appreciative
of other people who

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
are different, and more
aware of our commonality--

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that all of that
will be developing.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm very
hopeful for the future

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and think that the incorporation
and the mainstreaming

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics into society
will play a major role

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
in healing, spirituality,
recreation, creativity,

01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and cultural and human survival.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> If psychedelics do
become accepted for use

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
in our society, I think
that's where you're going to--

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
eventually I think there
should be centers where people

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
can go to have
these experiences,

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and they won't look
like hospitals.

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:03.620 align:middle line:90%
They'll look like spas.

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You go for a weekend
to take psychedelics

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
with mom and the kids, and
you have a wonderful weekend.

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:14.755 align:middle line:84%
And you come out, and you're a
more evolved and wiser person.

01:18:14.755 --> 01:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In an ideal world, we would
drop this Western arrogance

01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:21.270 align:middle line:90%
that we know better.

01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
We would realize
that, as much as we've

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
achieved with Western
technology and science,

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:32.600 align:middle line:90%
we've also lost a lot.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we've lost are deep
wisdoms developed and lived

01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:40.683 align:middle line:90%
by aboriginal peoples.

01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'll drop
the idea that there's

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
only one way of
looking at things,

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and we would allow ourselves
to explore other modalities

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
to be justifiably
proud of what we know,

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and to be humble about
what we don't know.

01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we live
in a culture of PTSD.

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're always trying
to soothe our symptoms.

01:19:04.050 --> 01:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I just sort of see that
we've just got it all wrong.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I was in a white hospital room
with sanitized airplane cabin

01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:19.770 align:middle line:90%
air for a very long time.

01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And really you
need nature, and I

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
think that there's an arrogance
in the West of thinking

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:37.903 align:middle line:84%
that we humans can do nature
better than nature can.

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So the story I'd been told
ended up being far different

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
from the reality I'd experienced
in these last couple of years

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
once I started exploring
psychedelics and this whole

01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:47.360 align:middle line:90%
other world.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.950 align:middle line:90%
And it made me think.

01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Were we supposed to
have these experiences,

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
have this relationship
with plant medicines

01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and psychedelics?

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And if we were, what happened?

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.540 align:middle line:90%
How did we get disconnected?

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Was it intentional?

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Were we severed from this
relationship on purpose,

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:04.950 align:middle line:90%
or did it just happen?

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And are we then
experiencing a deficiency?

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the state of
the world and a lot of people

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.960 align:middle line:84%
on a personal level feel all
this chaos and disconnection.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it only makes sense that
something like psychedelics

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
can help to heal both the
individual and the world--

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:24.120 align:middle line:90%
is take it in the right context.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And people have the opportunity
to take it in a place

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
where there is no fear of being
caught for legality reasons.

01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are centers
opening up now where

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
people can have these
experiences, so there

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
is a promising sort of light
at the end of the tunnel.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that the
world will be a better

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
place if more people can
have these experiences.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't find it a
coincidence that ayahuasca

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
has come out of the jungle
and spread across the world.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And iboga out of Africa is now
spreading across the world.

01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
The disconnected
world we live in

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.280 align:middle line:90%
is starving for reconnection.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.232 align:middle line:84%
Not only have they been used
safely for thousands of years,

01:21:00.232 --> 01:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
they really don't fit the
illegal status requirements

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.060 align:middle line:90%
most of them fall under.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
They have shown immense
potential for spiritual growth

01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:08.735 align:middle line:84%
and have support from the
spiritual community, as well.

01:21:08.735 --> 01:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
They also create an
experience that has

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.493 align:middle line:90%
transformed the lives of many.

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it time to reconsider
the role of plant medicines

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:16.660 align:middle line:90%
as psychedelics in our society?

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it time to at least allow
people to have the freedom

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to choose for themselves
the right to explore

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.930 align:middle line:90%
their own consciousness?

01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it time for truth?

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:28.400 align:middle line:90%


01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It is not too much to
say that, in your hands,

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
lies the possibility of averting
other tragedies like it.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
We must work untiringly
so that our children are

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
obliged to learn the
truth, because it is only

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
through knowledge that we
can safely protect them.

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Failing this, the
next tragedy may

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:56.356 align:middle line:84%
be that of your daughter, or
your son, or yours, or yours,

01:21:56.356 --> 01:21:57.320 align:middle line:90%
or yours.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:24:16.360 align:middle line:90%


01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you guys so much
for watching "Psyched Out."

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I really think that, with more
awareness around the subject

01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:25.417 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics, it'll become
more mainstream, and a lot more

01:24:25.417 --> 01:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
money and research will
get to go into it so

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:30.748 align:middle line:84%
that we could really find out
the full potential that it has.

01:24:30.748 --> 01:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's for
health, whether it's

01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:35.740 align:middle line:84%
for physical health,
mental health, creativity,

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
the sky is the
limits in my opinion.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.728 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for watching, guys.

01:24:39.728 --> 01:24:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Please share with your friends.

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Help spread the word so we can
raise awareness about planet

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.580 align:middle line:90%
medicines and psychedelics.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Peace.
