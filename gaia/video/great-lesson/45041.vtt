00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But we still think
about the separation.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:10%
>>Mind-body problem
essentially is

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:10%
how do you get from this
fuzzy thing called the thought

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:10%
to this material
thing called the body?

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>So for me, the great
lesson in my life

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
was that my mind and my
body are a wholeness.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:90%
They're a unity.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I began this
path of really trying

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to find ways of understanding
myself in a deeper way

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and reuniting, bringing back
together, mind and body.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:10%
>>So what I want to do and
have been doing in research

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:10%
is to take the
mind and the body,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:10%
we put them back together.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.647 align:middle line:10%
What that means is if Ellen
is over here, she's over here.

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:10%
If she's over here, she's all
of her-- my mind, my body,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:10%
my elbows, my toes.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:10%
However you want to categorize
me, all of me is moving around.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Only part of us are
typically addressed.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, at
work, only part of us

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:90%
are allowed to come to work.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
In tennis, only, part of
us is getting instruction,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:84%
like instruction to our
body versus considering

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%
the whole part of us.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.875 align:middle line:84%
>>Gregory Bateson is this
wonderful thinking mind.

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
He's a wonderful,
wonderful scientist

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:90%
with this brilliant mind.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But he was also very
underdeveloped with his body.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:84%
He was a person all
head, very little body.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But when we
collaborate together,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
he realized he's
missing the body part.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
So I used to teach him.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I said well, listen.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, your body needs
to do more thinking.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And your mind needs
to dance more.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Today, people
have done studies

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that show that the mind
and the body are connected

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and that every thought
we have is instantly

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
communicated to every
cell in our body.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>So the earliest
experiment we did on this

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
was what now call the
Counterclockwise study.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
In this study I took elderly
gentleman-- my students

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and I took elderly gentleman
to a timeless retreat.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And the retreat was retrofitted
to 20 years earlier.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we did was to have
the experimental group live

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.865 align:middle line:84%
in that retreat for a week
as if it was 20 years ago.

00:11:48.865 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.385 align:middle line:90%
The past was the present.

00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:84%
They would discuss things
that were happening then,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
but they would do it
in the present tense.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And in all ways, it
was for them 1959.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:90%
The results were astounding.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.194 align:middle line:84%
They were standing on their
own, in that vision improved,

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
hearing improved, physical
strength improved.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:90%
They looked younger.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's even more
astounding when

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
you recognize that
as you get older,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.247 align:middle line:84%
things are only
supposed to fall apart.

00:12:31.247 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
that they got better,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.475 align:middle line:84%
but this is a
group of people who

00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:36.015 align:middle line:90%
is not supposed to get better.

00:12:36.015 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>We all have
tremendous powers to tap

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:90%
into our own inner pharmacy.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean
the power we have

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:90%
to work with our own thoughts.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are biochemical
and neurotransmitter events

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
in our brain.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have the ability to
create exactly the kind

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of prescription that
we want for ourselves

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
by choosing our
thoughts more carefully.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Most people know, for example,
that placebos are very, very

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
effective-- so effective
that before you

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
can bring a drug to market, it
has to outperform the placebo.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>In the medical
profession, be it

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
from drugs or surgery or any
other modality, one third

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
of all healing guaranteed
to be due to the belief

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.145 align:middle line:84%
of the patient,
the placebo effect.

00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>So the Medical world is
often not happy with placebos,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
because it means
that this medicine,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
it is no better than a placebo.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And people overlook just
how effective placebos are.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Here you're taking
a drug that's inert.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you get better,
it's clearly not because

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
of the drug, because
the drug is inert.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So somehow you're
making yourself better.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>A positive thinking
can enhance our life.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And negative thinking can
actually cause disease

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%
and can actually cause death.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
A scientific name for the
negative side of this point

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.024 align:middle line:84%
coin is called
the nocebo effect.

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>So when people have
negative thoughts,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
when they have chronic
anxiety or depression,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
they're much more
susceptible to illness,

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes twice as
susceptible to colds and flus

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
traumatic events

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
can have a traumatic effect
on the body, even shrinking

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
parts of the brain, that
they don't develop properly.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So like the hippocampus
in the brain

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
has been demonstrated
to be affected

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:84%
by sexual abuse in women
and war trauma in men.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So these are pretty dramatic
demonstrations of the effect

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that the body and the
mind have on each other.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>You can recover from
a terminal illness

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:90%
with a placebo effect.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
A nocebo effect can take
a perfectly healthy person

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.727 align:middle line:90%
and kill them.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.721 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:56.721 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>We're here at the top
of a mountain right now.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:10%
And we're looking down over
this vast county of Santa Cruz.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:10%
And from up here, I
have a state of calm.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:10%
That's my center.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And I can look out there and
I can see everything going on.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I can see the chaos below.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But I can get clarity
by being up here alone,

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:90%
away from it all.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the center.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The key is to be down there away
from this wonderful ashram-like

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
effect, go down, and function
at a high level with all

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:90%
the chaos.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>How do you find your center?

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Look at the human body.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Where is the center point
of your uprightness?

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's right in the lower
belly, below my belt.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And in Chinese we
call this [CHINESE].

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It literally means the
field, the reservoir

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.790 align:middle line:90%
of your vital essence.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Hindu language
will be the lower chakra.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.665 align:middle line:84%
And then American,
everyday, it's your gut.

00:16:27.665 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:90%
It's your gut-level energy.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:90%
It's from the belly.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we do
things from our heart,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:90%
which is on this upper level.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we think up here.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we tend
to be more up here.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:90%
We are more intellectual.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:90%
We tend to be more up here.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can
be very emotional

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
from the so-called
feeling place.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%
But look at me here.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It's still a little
bit too high,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:90%
which is part of being human.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you really want to find
center, you got to go deeper.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Go to your gut.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Go to this place
below the navel.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
>>If there's a wholeness,
than there's a center to that

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:90%
wholeness.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I find that it's helpful to
tune into your body and notice

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
where's your center at
any particular moment.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And often, it's a feeling
of energy in your body.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It could be a feeling
of anxiety in your body.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And if that center of
energy is up in your head,

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
then you know you're
up in your head.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.185 align:middle line:84%
That center of energy
is in your heart,

00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
you know you're really
feeling in your heart.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:10%
If that center of energy
is down in your belly,

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:10%
you know you're feeling
centered in your body.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:10%
>>The center is a moving center.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Like at one moment, I might
be physically centered.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I should always be
physically centered.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And if my mind is in
my feet, so to speak,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
is the way I used to say
it, my mind is rooted

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always
experiencing my feet,

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:84%
then everything else
for me falls into place.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:10%
>>If you're waking
up in the morning,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:10%
then you're very
heavy in your head.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:10%
So your center
could be your head.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:10%
Or you could have deep emotions
in the hole in your chest.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:10%
You're losing the wonderful
place of your centering, which

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:10%
is in the center of your body.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is that
all of your movements

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:90%
are very sluggish.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The blood doesn't
flow as well as it

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%
should flow to your cells.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's where many disease
are starting to occur.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is that the
bacteria starts to eat you,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
instead of you benefiting from
the bacteria in your body.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Then the virus is overcoming
your immune system.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So your immune system
attacking the viruses.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Many things are happening
when you're not centered.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think we all know
what the idea of centering

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:90%
would be physically.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
If we're moving, we'd
want to be balanced.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And then that would
require being centered

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
center of gravity,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
making sure that we
have a firm foundation

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:84%
so that our center is supported
so that we can be balanced.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a crucial
element in all sports

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and performing
well in all sports.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I think equally important is
centering in terms of the mind.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you imagine that
our mind is normally

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
chattering quite a bit and
constantly talking to us,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I think centering
in terms of the mind

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.646 align:middle line:84%
would be having a
still or quiet mind.

00:19:32.646 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:10%
>>So when you have
a centered presence,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:10%
basically it means
that you're present.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.445 align:middle line:10%
You're present to
others and your present

00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:10%
to the environment.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:10%
It means that you're
open to possibilities

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:10%
and your body's open
to possibilities.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're connected--
present, open, and connected.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're connected
at the same time

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to what matters to you,
what your values are, what

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
your vision is, what
your ethics are.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And by staying
connected to yourself

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that way, then your
actions will be,

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I think, not only more
skillful, but also

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
be more intended
and more focused.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you think of
the amount of time

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.565 align:middle line:84%
we spend in an accumulative way
in a lifetime stuck in traffic.

00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:17.639 align:middle line:84%
What if every moment that
you used as a traffic light,

00:20:17.639 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting frustrated
because it's a red light,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:20.888 align:middle line:90%
it's a centering light.

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity
to become helpful.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Months in a lifetime, 24/7.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Better than a monastery.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It's accumulative.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:90%
We can do this.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>I think emotionally
there's a centering as well,

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
which is, in my opinion,
the center of emotion

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%
is acceptance.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
accepting who we are,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
accepting what our
capabilities are.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all of that
connects with the other thing

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned, which is
being in the here and now.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I remember teaching several
multiple sclerosis patients

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of mine to start and walk
and focus on their center.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And it was really wonderful to
see how the focus on the center

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.445 align:middle line:10%
helps them walk better.

00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
If they can already
walk, but they're limping

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.794 align:middle line:84%
and they focus on the center,
they will always walk better.

00:21:11.794 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Periodically
throughout the day.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's when you
put your seat belt on.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a light.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's when you
boot up your computer.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You're not booting
up your computer.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.379 align:middle line:84%
You're booting up
also your center.

00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe when you're
washing the dishes,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
scrubbing the pot,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:90%
you're scrubbing your soul.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:10%
All of these are
incredible opportunities.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:10%
>>I myself found in skydiving
this amazing relationship

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.432 align:middle line:10%
to being centered, which
allowed me to really be relaxed.

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:10%
In the midst of that relaxation,
I didn't have any tension,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:10%
and I could really be present.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Something went wrong right, I
just could easily address that.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
things don't go wrong.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes right.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And you're free.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.986 align:middle line:84%
I'm hurdling towards the
Earth at 125 miles an hour,

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm laughing,
and I'm playing.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>At any time, can
we get more aligned?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Can we begin working
with our breath?

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Can we begin making distinction?

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:90%
See, people can do this.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We need to start understanding
that in your daily life,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:84%
putting periodically
moments when you do this,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
it will shift entirely
how you not only think--

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:84%
your neurological
pathways over time--

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
but your emotional
intelligence--

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
how you actually operate.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
You start to shift
your neurology.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Magic begins to happen.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
We can either expand
our energy at any given

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.416 align:middle line:84%
time at a cellular level,
or we can contract it.

00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
When we contract and hold,
we become that dead branch.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Life starts to go out.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Health problems start to occur.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Too much inwardness
makes your contraction,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
makes you close in.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Too much outwardness, you
lose yourself out there.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So tai chi is the balance
between the outward you

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and internal you.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese, we say,
[CHINESE] out there

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and [CHINESE] in here in one
complete yin yang gesture.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no difference.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a continuity
of how to bring

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:90%
the external self into yourself.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Within yourself, you need to
allow the expansion happen.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Extending is this
capacity to allow

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
your energy, your
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE], your chi,

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
your elan vital, your attention
to flow out of your body.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And then by flowing
out of your body,

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
it becomes like a receptor
where you can not only

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:84%
touch other things and other
sensitive beings will feel

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that touch, but also it's a way
that you can listen to others.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So by extending your attention
out, what you're doing

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is a commitment to
a deeper listening.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>You just mentioned Al
Huang, Chungliang Al Huang,

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and I workshopped with him many
years ago, 10 or 15 years ago.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:90%
He has a great story.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
He talked about his wife
had learned as a dancer

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to, when she's doing
the plie, the instructor

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:84%
had told her, think
about squeezing

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:84%
a dime between your
cheeks as you're going.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:90%
So he presented that to us.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And then he said the key to
everything we're talking about

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:90%
is drop the dime, drop the dime.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that's physically
we have to drop the dime.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.475 align:middle line:90%
We have to release and let go.

00:24:40.475 --> 00:24:42.475 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do that
mentally and emotionally.

00:24:42.475 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>If you feel trapped
inside, all you have to do

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:84%
is just open yourself
up physically.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Open your chest.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Open your arms.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
The body is such a
transparent language.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
If you feel trapped, you
continue to think expansion

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
without opening your
arms, open your shoulders,

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:90%
you will be trapped forever.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Physically, you need to
trust you need to expand.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>When we feel somebody walk
into our room, our office,

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
our home, and they're
very contracted,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:90%
our tendency is to contract.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:90%
And then we get further apart.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to
contract, if that's our habit,

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:90%
they contract.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>So when people, their heart
is closed, their mind is closed,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:84%
they are contracted
into a little me.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
The little me looks like
this physically, emotionally.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>People would look
at me or look at what

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
in going they're not
comfortable in themself.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:90%
They're at fight.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:84%
They're a struggle
with something.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say in the West, our
common-sense idea of relaxation

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is you have a Bud, and you're
lying on the couch, Saturday

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
morning or Saturday noon
or something like that.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.985 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things
that makes me laugh

00:25:57.985 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
is when people give
you the meditation.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Now you relax.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And you relax more.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And you relax more.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.010 align:middle line:90%
We start connective tissue.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
With tense muscle, you sit
down, and you believe that.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Truth is, you have to
really open up in your body.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>That means that you're in
harmony with the field gravity.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:90%
You're not fighting gravity.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm doing this,
or if I'm doing this,

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm tightening my
jaw, or holding my breath,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.392 align:middle line:84%
or leaning forward, or leaning
away, I'm fighting gravity.

00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>You have to be aware
of your breathing.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
aware of the blood flow.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be aware
of your whole system.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
When you're aware of all of
that, when you give yourself

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
all that you deserve to have
in life, you'll be centered.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>We need to take
moments, just becoming

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.230 align:middle line:84%
more aware and present,
to start expanding

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:90%
our mind at the highest level.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It's expanding our energy.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It's literally
beginning to breathe

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
in not a hope, but
our highest qualities.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
What qualities can you
breathe in right now.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to work, and
you're at a centering light,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, and
you get present,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:90%
now start engaging your mind.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.549 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in the
qualities you need.

00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%
What do you need at work?

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Be the best team player you
can, to be very enthusiastic,

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:90%
to be creative, to have energy.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Breathe it in now.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Let it penetrate into the cells.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
On the exhalation, breathe
it out to the world.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to give
our minds something

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to think about, except
instead of letting

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.770 align:middle line:84%
it dwell on the same
thoughts we had yesterday

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and the day before, which
is basically judgmental,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
past-future thinking.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>When you want to get
out of this little place,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:90%
simply open up.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes, look around.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Open your heart.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Open your mind.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.256 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly you are different.

00:27:45.256 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.364 align:middle line:84%
>>There are enough
experiments that

00:28:00.364 --> 00:28:01.905 align:middle line:84%
were done that are
showing that there

00:28:01.905 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:90%
is electricity in the body.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.202 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
biologists don't

00:28:06.202 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
want to hear about
it, because that

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.062 align:middle line:84%
means they're going to
have to restudy biology.

00:28:10.062 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to them, and
hopefully this documentary

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:90%
can change that.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Every human cell or
every biological cell

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:90%
is by definition a battery.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's because the
outside of the cell

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.125 align:middle line:84%
has a positive potential,
and inside the cell,

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
just under the membrane if
you put in an electrode,

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:90%
is a negative potential.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So every cell has a small
amount of voltage to it.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:49.398 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.398 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're emitting this
force by summoning up

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
the energy through exercises
to milk the 50 trillion cells

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.787 align:middle line:84%
and then make a current that
can run through the body.

00:29:01.787 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Many years ago, when I
was teaching at University

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of California, and we had
a kinesiology department,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
we had some Russian scientists
doing research on energy.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And they would film
my tai chi class.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.034 align:middle line:84%
The first week we were doing
the tai chi movement, only

00:29:24.034 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:90%
a little bit aura.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Second week, the
aura gets bigger.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.508 align:middle line:84%
By third week, the aura
is huge around the body.

00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So even scientifically
we can find proof

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.436 align:middle line:90%
about the transmission of chi.

00:29:37.436 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was in the
Philippines, a healer

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.490 align:middle line:90%
put his hand through my body.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Actually, several of them did.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, we would say,
well, that can't be,

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.341 align:middle line:90%
because the body's solid.

00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:90%
But it's not, it it?

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's vibrations.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.935 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
myself and the Filipino healer

00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:56.075 align:middle line:90%
is he absolutely knows that.

00:29:56.075 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't think it.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.884 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good idea.

00:29:58.884 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not a philosophy.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
If life is energy, if it's all
matter, energy interchangeable,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:90%
it is flowing.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
As we participate
in that process,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:84%
we start to recognize
that what we

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:84%
see as a problem, an object in
front of us, is simply energy.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And instead of this kind of
feeling, this push versus push,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:84%
we start-- as I do in my
practicing in the martial arts,

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:84%
like with Aikido--
you start to practice

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:90%
having this come at you.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And instead of pushing
back and getting run over,

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:90%
you engage the energy of it.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a confluence
that takes place.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And that confluence allows
you to be more powerful.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, in the 5
Rhythms, we talk about

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:84%
in the flowing rhythm to
really let the dance in,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:90%
to be receptive.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:18.190 align:middle line:84%
In the staccato rhythm, to let
go of whatever, to let it out,

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to let the dance come out,
to let your expression out.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
In the chaos rhythm, to really
let go, to just totally let go.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the lyrical rhythm,
it's letting go of letting go.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>There's a place in life.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's draw.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a box.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you're inside that
box, everything goes right.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:84%
When you get outside of
it, things go haywire.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:90%
So the zone is a place.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.200 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an emotional,
mental, psychological space.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual space.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where we
demonstrate qualities

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.523 align:middle line:84%
like courage and
fearlessness, tenacity.

00:32:12.523 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
We're willing to suffer.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:84%
We're willing to become
comfortable with being

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.000 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
When you have all of
these qualities going on

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, we get
to a very special place.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.570 align:middle line:90%
We're not judging this place.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we're
going with the flow.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Going with the flow allows us
to think less with our minds

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:90%
and think with our bodies.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Our body has a lot of
stored-up, built-in,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
what I want to call
physical intelligence.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And this physical intelligence
performs perfectly well

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:90%
without our mind interfering.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Let go of the need to control
the outcome and the results

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and the points.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And focus in on your
little things in life,

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's business
or in the family

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:90%
or on the basketball court.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you do,
all of a sudden,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:84%
you will magically
take off into a place

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:84%
where you won't even
realize you are.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you realize you
are there, you'll be out of it,

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
because now you're focusing on
something completely different.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>What that zone
state is ultimately,

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I think, is a taste
of your higher self.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a level
of consciousness within us

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that feels great.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we're there, everybody
describes it very similar.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:84%
When we're in an activity
where the goal is clear
