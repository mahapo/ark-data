All right.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I think we're ready.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.625 align:middle line:90%
Let's go hit the trail.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:90%

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
My name is Sergei
Boutenko, and I'm

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
passionate about wild edibles.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:84%
After doing countless lectures
and workshops on edible plants

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
all over the world, I have
noticed approximately a dozen

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
edible plants that
I've been able to find

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
in North America, South
America, Europe, and Australia.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
In this video,
I'm going show you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
how to harvest and prepare the
most common wild edible plants.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Before we jump in, let's
cover some basic ground rules.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Number one, don't eat something
if you don't know what it is.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:90%
I cannot stress this enough.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Wildcrafting can
be safe and easy

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
if you follow this
one basic rule.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So be sure you can
positively identify

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
all the distinguishing
characteristics

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
of a wild edible plant
before you consume it.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Number two, try all new
plants in small amounts.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
All of our bodies are
different, and thus may

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
have different reactions
to perfectly edible plants.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
To avoid allergic
reactions and other mishaps

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
when eating new plants, limit
consumption to just a few

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:90%
leaves.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Number three, don't mix
too many wild edible plants

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
together in a meal
before you know

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:90%
how your body reacts to them.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
For the purposes
of this video, I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
will be playing with
lots of plants in order

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate how
I typically eat.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
However, if you're
new to foraging,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that you keep
your mixing to a minimum.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Once you have some
experience under your belt,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
then go ahead and mix all the
weeds you are familiar with.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
these three rules,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
it's also a good
idea to consider

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
the environment in which you
plan to harvest wild edibles.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Every forager should aim to
avoid chemicals, pesticides,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and other contaminated areas.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The following places
are definite no-no's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
for foraging-- railroads,
golf courses, major roadways,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and public areas
with heavy traffic.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:90%
If in doubt, ask around.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Do your research to figure
out if an area is clean.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
A responsible
wildcrafter is one who

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that he
or she can negatively

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
impact an area by overharvesting
its sensitive plant life.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
As a conscious
forager you should

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
approach an ecosystem the
way that you would a garden.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
When collecting wild
food, pick only what

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:90%
you need for the next few meals.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't stock up for
the week or the month.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Many people think
that wild edibles only

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:84%
grow in pristine
forest settings,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
but it is often
quite the opposite.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Just as garden vegetables
like warm temperatures,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
sunlight, and water,
so do wild edibles.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Thus, if you go looking
for tasty plant life

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
at high elevations,
in dark, forests,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:84%
or in regions that
are arid, you'll

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:90%
likely come home empty handed.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Great foraging
spots are generally

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
near water and below
4,000 feet in elevation.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, I'm
shooting this movie

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:90%
at my friend's organic farm.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Here we will find the most
common plants of the world,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and it is likely that these
same plants are growing

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:90%
in your own backyard right now.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let's dive in and pick

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.046 align:middle line:90%
some wild edible plants.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:44.469 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
The first wild edible I'd like
to introduce to you is grass.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, there's a
huge field of it behind me.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Grass is a great
beginner wild edible,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's easy to recognize
and it grows everywhere.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Worldwide, there's about
300 varieties of grass,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and all of them are
edible, which sort of makes

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:90%
it the perfect survival food.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
If you don't remember
anything else, remember this--

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:90%
all grasses are edible.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
It might not be the
tastiest meal you ever had,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but it will sustain
you and nourish you.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
All grasses are going to be
rich in chlorophyll, vitamins,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and minerals, and
they're essentially

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:90%
the same thing as wheatgrass.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Now because we're not livestock,
we're not cattle or goats,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
it might be difficult
for us to digest grass.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So the way that
you'd eat it is you

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
pull on the top of some grass
and look for the tender light

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
green parts.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
These tender light green
parts are a great lesson

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:90%
in meristems.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Meristems or meristematic
parts are the growing parts

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:90%
of a plant.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
These parts are
going to be tender.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be saturated
with more sugars and proteins,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and thus they're going to be
tastier and more nutritious.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you feel a part of
a plant that's flexible, maybe

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
lighter green in color,
that is a meristematic part,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's the part you
want to munch down on.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Give it a try.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.978 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
These yellow flowers
in front of me

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
belong to a plant
known as salsify,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or another common
name is goat's beard.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This is currently my
favorite wild edible.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:84%
They are the only dandelion
relative that's not bitter.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So the flowers and every other
tender part of this plant

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
is very, very
extremely delicious,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and can be eaten in
salads, sandwiches,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:90%
or as a trail-side nibble.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
It's all edible, but
the most tasty parts

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
are the tender parts--

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
the meristematic
parts, if you will--

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the growing parts that have
a lot of sugars in them, that

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:90%
have flex and give.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Now all dandelions are loaded
with vitamins and minerals.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
They're especially good for
our inner organs, our pancreas,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:90%
our kidneys, our liver.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to identify
a salsify is by the flower.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
These flowers come in
brilliant yellow and purple.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other distinguishing
characteristic

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
is that it has these green
sepals, these big green leaves

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:90%
behind the flower.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly
enough, this flower

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
is only open during
the morning hours.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to come
back here around noon,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
all of these flowers
would be shut.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to catch
the flower while it's open,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:90%
you've got to be an early bird.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
As I go to harvest these, I also
want to point out my philosophy

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
on roots.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
responsibility I

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
feel as a forager to harvest
plants in a manner that

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:84%
will save some for other animals
and also allow the plant itself

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
to keep growing,
so I very rarely

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
harvest the roots of plants.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I pull out
my trusty scissors,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:90%
and I just snip it off the top.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I leave the roots
intact, and then I

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:90%
throw my harvest in a bucket.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this is a good
time to also point out

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that wild edibles
are very perishable,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and so to preserve them while
harvesting, it's a good idea

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
to have bucket with cold water
as well as a little mister

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:90%
so that you can mist them down.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.517 align:middle line:84%
And this acts as
refrigeration in the field.

00:08:39.517 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
Some other key
features that identify

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
salsify are these very
long grass-like leaves.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
In late summer, these
flowers will also

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
turn into a huge
dandelion-like puff ball.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on which
stage you get it in,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
you can either identify
it by the flowers,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the tall slender grass-like
stems, or the big puff balls.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to go through here

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and harvest some of the flowers
as well as the other tender

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%
bits.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Right here, here's another
good thing to notice.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a flower that
hasn't opened yet,

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.515 align:middle line:84%
and this part is
very tasty, in fact.

00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And I could just go like that.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:43.020 align:middle line:84%
You just go through here and
pick off all the tender parts

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.033 align:middle line:84%
and throw those straight into
salads, sandwiches, your mouth.

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I would also like to
point out that when

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
you break the stem of a
salsify, white sap oozes out.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
This sap is perfectly
edible, and it

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
is very good for digestion
and your inner organs.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So don't be afraid
to eat the stuff.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited that we
got to see salsify.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
These flowers will look
beautiful in our salad

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.245 align:middle line:90%
later on.

00:10:19.245 --> 00:10:22.626 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:22.626 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Wild mustard is best identified
by our sense of smell,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because wild mustards
always smell like mustard.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you crush up any part
of this plant, whether it

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
be the flowers, the leaves, or
the stem and give it a smell,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
it should have a very
spicy mustard-like aroma.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Wild mustard is
insanely nutritious.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my friend and
fellow forager John Kallas

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
believes that wild mustard is
the number one most nutritious

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:90%
plant out there.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It's got really nice broad
leaves that are spicy and will

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%
be delicious in a stir fry.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go ahead
and mow this guy down.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Directly to my right,
you see yellow flowers

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:90%
that are gumdrop-shaped.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
These flowers are part
of pineapple weed,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and pineapple weed is
essentially wild chamomile.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Just like chamomile, pineapple
weed has soothing properties,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and this plant is best utilized
when dried and steeped in tea.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to identify a
pineapple weed is by the smell.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great lesson
in using all of our senses

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:90%
when foraging.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I advocate that all
new foragers get

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
in the practice
of using all five

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
of their senses, sight, hearing,
smell, touch, and taste,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
because all of those
senses will give you

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:90%
more information about a plant.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Now certain plants will be
easiest to identify with sight,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:84%
but other plants like this
will require other senses.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Pineapple weed actually
has kind of a fruity smell,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and it smells very much like a
blend of chamomile and fruit.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So the easiest way
to ID this plant

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is to crush up one of the
flowers and give it a smell,

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.267 align:middle line:84%
and it smells sort
of like pineapple.

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Additional features
that will help you

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
ID it are the yellow
pineapple-like flowers

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and the tiny little
leaves that are

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:90%
in leaflets under the flowers.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They look very much
like dill leaves.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm making
a salad later on,

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
this weed is not going to
be necessarily appropriate

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
for the salad, so I'm going
to let it be in the ground.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But now you know that
this is pineapple weed

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and all parts are edible,
and you could utilize it

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.544 align:middle line:90%
however you like.

00:13:02.544 --> 00:13:06.023 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:06.023 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
When I look directly to the
left of the pineapple weed,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
right here in front of me
there's another edible plant.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
This plant right here is
known as shepherd's purse,

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
and it's a type of wild mustard.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:90%
All wild mustards are edible.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Mustards are all
part of the Brassica

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
family, which includes plants
like arugula, cabbage, kale.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way to identify
a mustard, again, is by smell.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
When you crush up one of the
leaves and give it a sniff,

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
it should smell kind of
spicy, sort of like mustard.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I also want to point out that
it has heart-shaped seed pods,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is a great identifying
feature of shepherd's purse.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
This entire plant is edible.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm after the tender
leaves as well as the seed

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
pods, and if I'm lucky, I'll
even get a few of the flowers.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw all
of those in the salad

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to add a little bit
of spice and texture.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.337 align:middle line:84%
Now let's see what else
we can find on this farm.

00:14:06.337 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
In front of me I
have lamb's quarters,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
most common plants found

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a relative of quinoa.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you were
to see quinoa growing

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
right near lamb's
quarters, it would

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
be hard to tell the
two of them apart.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
This plant is one of the
richest plants in protein.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a very mild green.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It tastes kind of like
spinach, and it's a great green

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
in salads, smoothies.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to eat.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's very pleasant, so it's
a great beginner wild edible,

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and it grows rampant on
organic farms and empty lots.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a common weed in
gardens, and it's very hard

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:90%
to eradicate.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can literally
harvest this plant

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
until the cows come
home without fear

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
of worrying that you're going
to decimate the lamb's quarters

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's
called lamb's quarters

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
is because farmers used to
let their lambs graze on it.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So don't be afraid,
there's no meat products

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
within this plant.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It's just a name.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:84%
This plant is quite
easy to identify.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:90%
It's got a very hardy stem.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:84%
The stem also has purplish
pinkish lines all over it.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The leaves themselves
are covered

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:84%
with a fine whitish, sometimes
purplish dust, and the dust

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of rubs off and feels
very waxy to the touch.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is essentially
calcium, so you

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:90%
don't need to wash that off.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You can eat it
straight with that.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Interesting little fact--
the same dust that you

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:84%
see on the bottoms of
the leaves, on the leaves

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
themselves, acts as
a water repellent.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to dunk
the plant in water,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:84%
it would come out bone-dry
because of this dust.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
The entire plant is edible,
although the smaller

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the leaves the more nutritious
and the more delicious

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going to harvest
a bunch of this stuff

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
so that I can prepare some
tasty dishes with it later on.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:17.193 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:20.644 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:20.644 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.250 align:middle line:84%
This right here is green
amaranth, another tasty common

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:90%
weed.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It looks pretty similar
to lamb's quarters

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:90%
except for a key difference.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:84%
The seed pod at the top
is very easy to identify.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So the key identifying
characteristic

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
with green amaranth is
the seed pod at the top.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's spiky to the touch.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.145 align:middle line:90%
It has up to 15,000 seeds.

00:16:50.145 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't really want
to eat that part.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:90%
You want to eat the leaves.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The leaves are the
part that we're after.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
They're very tender,
great in salads.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And so with this
plant in particular,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested
in the leaves

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and not so interested
with anything else.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
Now with green
amaranth, there is

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
a plant that looks
similar to this

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
really want to eat.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
It's a nightshade, like
a common nightshade.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:84%
So you really want to look for
these seed pods to make sure

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
that it's green amaranth
and not the nightshade,

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and you want to make sure
the plant has smooth stems.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:29.854 align:middle line:84%
So smooth stems, seed pod,
green amaranth, green light.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
In front of me I
have common mallow,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
which is a close
relative of okra,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and it has a very
okra-like taste.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Another common
name for this plant

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.492 align:middle line:84%
is cheeses or buttonweed
because it grows little fruits

00:17:54.492 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of
buttons, which make

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:90%
it very easy to ID this plant.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It's another great wild
edible weed for beginners

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
because it has a
very subtle taste.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have a very strong
chlorophyll taste at all.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
When the leaves get
really big, it's

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:90%
a nice plant to use as wraps.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So we could put little pieces
of avocado in this plant

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and wrap it up, maybe pour
some lemon juice on it.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a very nice little snack--

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:90%
very simple, very fast.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The common identifying
characteristics

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
of common mallow is a long stem,
but the stem is not smooth.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:90%
It's got a little texture to it.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:90%
It's rough.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It also has leaves that
are overall disk shaped,

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:90%
but they have lobes.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:90%
So there are some lobes.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:90%
The leaves can get pretty big.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful of that.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It also has white
to purple flowers.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The best way to ID common
mallow is by its little fruits,

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:90%
also known as buttons.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
They're little disk-like fruits
that have big green sepals.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
They almost look
like little hops.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
These are very delicious.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
These parts right here
have the most okra flavor

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:90%
of the entire plant.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
The entire mallow
plant can be eaten.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You can boil it just
like you would okra.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:84%
You can use it in
gumbos, or you can

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:90%
eat raw in salads or smoothies.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:35.091 align:middle line:90%

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
We got purslane
growing right here.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And purslane is the number
one richest wild edible

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in omega 3 fatty acids,
which makes it a great plant

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to prevent any sort of
heart problems, Alzheimer's,

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:90%
multiple sclerosis.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very good for
the heart and the brain.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Purslane is a
sprawling weed that

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
grows low to the ground through
commonly planted lettuces

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and things, so you can
find it almost anywhere

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:90%
growing in between your crops.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
It's got a nice
lemony taste to it,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
delicious in smoothies.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I find that it helps
the smoothies stick

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:90%
together better.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever made
a green smoothie

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and then left it on the
counter, it tends to separate.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you add a green
in there like purslane,

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:84%
it'll bind the smoothie
and act as a binding agent

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
so that you can later
go back to that smoothie

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and it looks much more
appealing and appetizing.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Here are some identifying
characteristics.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Purslane looks like a succulent
and it's got a smooth stem.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's got teardrop-shaped leaves.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before, it
sprawls along the ground.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:59.286 align:middle line:84%
So if we really look close,
like over here, baboom.

00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It has these big branches
that crawl along the ground,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and that's perhaps the best
identifying characteristic.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
As purslane matures, it tends to
develop a red hue on the stem.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That's a great identifying
characteristic.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:90%
The entire plant is edible--

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
the stem, the
flowers, the greens.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The tender greens, the
meristematic parts,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
the parts that are
growing, are going

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
to be the most nutritious
and the tastiest.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.423 align:middle line:84%
Throw the entire
plant in smoothies,

00:21:27.423 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
but if you're going
to use it in salads,

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I recommend taking
just the leaves

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.346 align:middle line:90%
and peeling it off the plant.

00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:38.804 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:38.804 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Quite often when you sit
down to harvest one plant

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
you can find other plants
in close proximity.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, here we have
prickly lettuce, dandelion,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:90%
and more mustard greens.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
The prickly lettuce
and the dandelions

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:90%
are the origin of all lettuces.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years ago, before
romaine lettuce or red leaf

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.260 align:middle line:84%
lettuce, there was prickly
lettuce and dandelions.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And my guess is that from
those origins people hybridized

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.767 align:middle line:84%
lettuce because they wanted
a sweeter, bigger leaf.

00:22:17.767 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So essentially they would
see a dandelion growing,

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of
bitter to the taste.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And they would look
for that variety

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that was slightly sweeter
and had big leaves.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
They'd wait for
it to go to seed,

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and plant those seeds to get
even bigger, sweeter leaves.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And they did this
over and over again

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
until now we have
something that looks almost

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:90%
nothing like a dandelion.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing about
these wild lettuces

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
actually more nutritious

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:90%
than store-bought lettuces.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They generally have
longer root systems.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Those roots can go down
below depleted topsoil

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and draw out more
vital nutrients

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:90%
for our bodies to assimilate.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Dandelions are perhaps one of
the most underappreciated weeds

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people would never
think to eat a dandelion

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and in fact curse them for
growing in their lawns.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But they're loaded with all
kinds of good stuff for us,

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and they actually make for a
really tasty smoothie green.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
They're a little bit
bitter to the taste,

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
but if you blend
them in a smoothie

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:90%
with fresh fruit, no problem.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people could probably
identify a dandelion,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
but let me give you some key
identifying characteristics.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:84%
For starters, the leaf
has jagged-like lobes.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in French it's
called dent-de-leon,

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
which means tooth of a
lion, and you can kind of

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
see that the lobes
that are sharp

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
resemble a tooth of a lion.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Dandelions also have
smooth stems and one

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:90%
yellow flower per stem.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
A fun little fact is that
you can eat the flowers.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:90%
They're very tasty.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
They're great in salads.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And they actually concentrate
vitamin D from the sun,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and thus are a great little
additive for an emotional boost

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:90%
in your meal.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:84%
A key tell to tell a
true dandelion apart

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
from its lookalikes
is the main vein.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
If you flip the leaf
over and run your finger

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
along the main vein, dandelions
will always have a smooth stem.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Dandelion lookalikes will
have a fuzzy or prickly stem.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.294 align:middle line:90%

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Directly to the left
of the dandelion,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
we have what's known
as prickly lettuce.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
At first glance, the leaves kind
of look like dandelion leaves.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you flip the
leaf over, you'll

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
notice that the main vein
has prickly thorns on it.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The dandelion on the left,
prickly lettuce on the right.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd also like to point
out that both plants have

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
milky white sap.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm making
a salad today,

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I probably won't be harvesting
too much prickly lettuce.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But in my regular practice,
I often do harvest this plant

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:90%
and blend it in a smoothie.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:84%
To my right, I also have
some wild mustard leaves.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.365 align:middle line:84%
Now earlier we picked some
yellow mustard flowers.

00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pick
some leaves now

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:90%
in order to fluff up the salad.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Just a quick reminder
that all mustard greens

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:90%
smell like mustard.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.698 align:middle line:84%
So if ever in doubt, crunch
a leaf up, give it a smell,

00:25:25.698 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and if it smells like
mustard, you're good to go.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:34.656 align:middle line:90%

rose is a rose is a rose,"

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:84%
which means that a
wild rose is very

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
similar to a domesticated rose.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Unlike domesticated roses,
wild roses have five petals.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to take
a domesticated rose

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and let it go wild, it
would eventually returned

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:84%
to its natural DNA,
which is five petals.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Another great identifying
characteristic of the rose

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:90%
is the hardy stem with thorns.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:90%
All roses are edible.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a fun little tidbit
is that apples and blackberries

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:84%
are actually part
of the rose family.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Roses are all rich
in iron, so they're

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:84%
very good for
people lacking iron.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
The flowers can be used
in salads, on desserts.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The leaves are
oval and serrated,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and when they're young
they're very tender

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.668 align:middle line:90%
and can also be used in salads.

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:47.112 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:47.112 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Some plants are sun-loving,
and this rose right here

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:90%
is a sun-loving plant.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
At the base of the rose,
you see miner's lettuce,

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and miner's lettuce is
a shade-loving plant.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So not only are we
witnessing two plants that

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
love different
environments, we're

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
also witnessing a
symbiotic relationship.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:84%
The sun-loving plant
is casting shadow

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:90%
for the shade-loving plant.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Come in a little closer, and
I'll show you miner's lettuce.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So miner's lettuce is one
of the tastiest wild edibles

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:90%
I know of.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very mild to the taste.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have a strong
chlorophyll taste.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially the romaine
lettuce of the weed world.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very rich in vitamin c.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one cup of this
stuff has about 90 milligrams

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:90%
of vitamin C.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It's quite easy to identify.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It has big disk-like
leaves, and it

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:84%
has a smooth stem
that goes directly

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:90%
through the middle of the leaf.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Another great identifying
characteristic

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
is that miner's
lettuce all stems

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:90%
from the exact same place.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pick this miner's
lettuce, add it to the salad

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.888 align:middle line:90%
later on, and it's going to go--

00:28:05.888 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
finger-licking good.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm cutting the stalks so
as not to eradicate the roots.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a nice batch
of freshly harvested miner's

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:27.245 align:middle line:84%
lettuce that's going to
taste amazing in the salad.

00:28:27.245 --> 00:28:31.522 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.522 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Now that the weeds are picked,
let's make a monster salad.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Before we start chopping,
it's a good idea

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.245 align:middle line:84%
to give our wild
edibles a rinse.

00:28:49.245 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do this just like we

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:90%
would with any vegetables.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Going to dunk them in water
like so, give them a nice shake.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:01.260 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
This is also a great
opportunity to pick

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:90%
through your wild edibles.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.508 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you don't have
any foreign plants in there.

00:29:06.508 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just going
to start chopping them.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:90%
We got our mustard greens.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.512 align:middle line:90%
Into the bowl they go.

00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%
We have some of our purslane.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing about
fresh food is that when

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:42.470 align:middle line:84%
you have scraps you just
throw them back into nature.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So we got our juicy purslane.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I find that it's easiest
to just harvest it

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.470 align:middle line:84%
straight with some
scissors into the salad.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going for the
juiciest leaves,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
but the stems will give
us some nice crunch

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.295 align:middle line:90%
and nice organic compost.

00:30:06.295 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Here we also have
our green amaranth.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Dunk.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:21.638 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.638 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Now with the green amaranth,
we don't necessarily

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:90%
want the spiky seed head.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to pop off
the leaves into the salad,

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.068 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
compost the seed heads.

00:30:33.068 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's actually
faster to go with scissors,

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:90%
so here I go again.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Find a technique
that works for you.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
taste really nice.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting
for this all day.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:90%
What else do we got here?

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Ah, miner's lettuce.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.545 align:middle line:90%
This is choice salad greens.

00:31:04.545 --> 00:31:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:90%
In they go.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Nice little rinse.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:16.065 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.065 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Grab our scissors.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.380 align:middle line:84%
The stems are juicy,
full of vitamin C,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:84%
so we definitely
want those in there.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Pull out some of these roots.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.945 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.945 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The little sticks, those
are just extra fiber.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:46.082 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.082 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Aha, lamb's quarters.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:32:00.733 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.733 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:84%
With some plants,
there's actually

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:84%
a trick to getting
them off the stems,

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and lamb's quarters
is one of those.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You can just hold the stem
firmly, slide your fingers

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:84%
along it, and the leaves
will pop right off.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a terribly picky eater.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind a little
bit of fibrous parts.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to throw salads
together pretty quickly.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to spend more
time and have less stems

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.620 align:middle line:84%
in your salad, you're
very welcome to do so.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.415 align:middle line:84%
Some of this lamb's
quarters is nice and purple,

00:32:43.415 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:84%
so it's going to add
some color to our salad.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:84%
If I were to be blending
this stuff in smoothies--

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a very high-powered
blender at home,

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
so I'd just chop it up either
with scissors or a knife,

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.350 align:middle line:84%
throw it straight
into the blender.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.385 align:middle line:90%
No muss, no fuss.

00:33:05.385 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We got our common
mallow over here.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Same principle.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:21.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
With common mallow, it really
is easier to use your scissors.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Just going to come in here
and chop the leaves straight

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:90%
in the salad.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.298 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.298 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I personally love the
little buttons in the salad

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.257 align:middle line:84%
as well, so I'm going
to add them for texture.

00:33:35.257 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you are lucky enough
to have some flowers,

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and chop those in.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.285 align:middle line:84%
This is going to add
some really nice crunch.

00:33:51.285 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.639 align:middle line:84%
We've got some dandelion
greens in here,

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:90%
some more mustard leaves.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Get some of those going.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:50.929 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
And we have these beautiful
mustard flowers right here.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.263 align:middle line:84%
Those absolutely
must go in the salad.

00:34:57.263 --> 00:34:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually
going to cut them.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I've been misting them all day,
so I don't want to rinse them.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise they're all going
to end up in the water.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to cut them
straight into the bowl.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:84%
We also have some salsify
and some shepherd's purse.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.752 align:middle line:90%
Give that a rinse.

00:35:26.752 --> 00:35:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember with the salsify all
of the tender parts are edible,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
so all the tender
parts of the stem

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
can be utilized in the
salad, especially the tops.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
The tops, even if they're
an unopened flower,

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:90%
taste very good.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's another top.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We also have our
shepherd's purse.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember those are
the heart-shaped ones.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And just like with
the lamb's quarters,

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hold them by the
stalk and slide them right in.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Quickest way to
harvest the seed pods.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.950 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Starting to come together
nicely I also brought with me

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.685 align:middle line:90%
some condiments today.

00:36:42.685 --> 00:36:44.310 align:middle line:84%
For my field dressing,
I'm going to use

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.880 align:middle line:84%
some olive oil, a little
balsamic vinegar, a little sea

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:84%
salt, Bragg's Liquid Aminos,
and some nutritional yeast.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So just going to dress
it with olive oil.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.615 align:middle line:90%
I like to eyeball everything.

00:37:06.615 --> 00:37:07.415 align:middle line:90%
Bragg's.

00:37:07.415 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like I forgot
my balsamic vinegar, so

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:90%
no balsamic vinegar.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
A little sea salt. And we have
some organic nutritional yeast.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:43.440 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to give
it a good, nice long mix.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.775 align:middle line:84%
For the finale, I'm going to
put my flowers in the salad.

00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:09.107 align:middle line:84%
So I have my tasty salsify
flowers right there.

00:38:09.107 --> 00:38:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Those are going to go in on top.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I also have some wild rose.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Got my wild rose petals.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.845 align:middle line:90%
Straight into the salad.

00:38:19.845 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And I happened
upon these daisies.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And daisies are part of
the sunflower family, which

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
is one of the largest
family of plants,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.760 align:middle line:90%
and all sunflowers are edible.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So these oxeye daisies are
definitely going in the salad.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't buy a salad
this good if you tried.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I hope that with this
video I have dispelled

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.180 align:middle line:84%
some of the common fears
about harvesting wild edibles

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and inspired you to
explore the outdoors

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.630 align:middle line:90%
in a safe and conscious manner.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Now you have the tools
to take advantage

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of these tasty hidden
treasures and you

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:84%
can go out and reap all the
benefits that wild edibles have

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:90%
to offer.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I recently learned that a banana
travels an average of 2,500

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.850 align:middle line:90%
miles to get to the consumer.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of the disadvantages
of such practices

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.370 align:middle line:84%
include loss of freshness,
food being harvested

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:84%
before it's ripe, and a
massive waste of the Earth's

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:90%
finite resources.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.097 align:middle line:84%
Wild edibles, on the other hand,
are an entirely local food.

00:39:33.097 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You can harvest them
straight from the ground when

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
they are fresh, and the only
energy expended is your own.

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We call this energy
expenditure exercise,

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's recommended
by health experts

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:90%
to be done on a daily basis.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.500 align:middle line:84%
In addition, harvesting free
food can save you lots of money

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.940 align:middle line:90%
on your grocery bill.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And from a nutritional
standpoint,

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
wild food is superior to
store-bought food anyway.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else, foraging
exposes you to nature

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and thus gets you
breathing fresh air,

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:84%
collecting vitamin D on
your skin from the sun.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And in an era when we spend the
majority of our time in front

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:84%
of screens, being outside
with weeds is invaluable.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
