The grizzly bear used to be
throughout all of California.

They'll get into these
little rotting trees,

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and they'll break
them onto the ground,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.367 align:middle line:84%
and they'll rip them up,
and they'll look for grubs,

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:90%
and they'll look for mushrooms.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're part of that
understory management.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
In the grasslands, we
don't have our herds of elk

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%

our antelope that would stomp

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:90%
the grass into the ground.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
That would manage
that thatch layer,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that build up of organic
matter that happens over time.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So without those big animals,
we don't get that management

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
regime again.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've taken the land away
from the Indigenous people.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Indigenous
people of these ecologies

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:90%
understood the role of fire.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:10%
And they knew the
right time of year

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:10%
to provide a healing fire,
a fire that slowly moves

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:10%
through the understory
that consumes

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:10%
a lot of that underbrush
that would in a big fire,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:10%
go up into those canopies.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of that
fuel load reduction.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It alkalinizes the soil.

There's so many benefits
to a healing fire.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're here on the
side that hasn't burned.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
material here, a lot.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And so if a fire blows through
like it did on that hillside,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to have
all of this material

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to fuel that fire, and get
it up into the forest, which

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is of course, scary
and catastrophic.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.162 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of an example.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the
other challenge,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:84%
is that because all this
material is aerial now,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:90%
it's just sort of oxidized.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So this actually represents
carbon right here.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This represents what
could be topsoil,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
right, the sponge of the
Earth that can absorb water.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But because this material
is just up here in the air,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
it can't actually break
down, and so it has

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:90%
a hard time turning to soil.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So what with the elk would do
is would actually come in here

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and smash this material
down to the ground

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, where
during the winter,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.797 align:middle line:84%
that water could wick up, and
there'd be biological activity.

00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:90%
And it could actually decompose.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention, that elk
would come and actually

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
munch this back, so provide
that grazing function.

is very low function, right?

starts to grow, it's eaten.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And if it starts to regrow,
it's eventually eaten.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So its ability and
opportunity to grow

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to maturation, to flower, to
fruit, to senesce and disperse

but if that grassland

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
has been in decline
for a long time,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
then there might be
a lot of bare ground.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
There might be a
lot of old plants.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%

hammering that ground, compress

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
it, then just run off

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So I want plants
to be able to grow

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to their full
reproductive capacity.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I want them to be
able to fully recover

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:90%
before they're grazed again.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And a fundamental part
of planned grazing

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
is keeping animals on the move.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having cows
scattered throughout a 400 acre

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:84%
pasture four months
out of the year,

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll have them in a much smaller
pasture for maybe just a day,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:90%
or a few hours.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:90%
And then I keep moving them.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is that all
of the grassland surrounding

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
where the cows are gets that
much more time to recover,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
such that the soil's
becoming more rich in carbon,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:84%
more rich in organic matter,
and the specie's diversity is

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:90%
increasing.

It's the notion of slow it,
spread it, sink it, right?

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
When rain hits a layer of
litter instead of bare ground

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:84%
or thatch, the
particles are broken up.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
smaller in size,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:90%

But when we get rain, it
just it-- it's like it's

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.090 align:middle line:90%
shooting down.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it just comes down.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And these things overflowed.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So they hold, well,
865 gallons a piece.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So I had 1600, 1700

to when we get big rains,

and what to prep
for, and just start.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%

planting more plants,

as Owens Lake.

to go is down into the lake.

calling to the water

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and saying, come.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.440 align:middle line:84%

lake, because they

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
