>> One of the most remarkable
things, Jim, about you,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is that when I look at your
retinas, as a retina doctor--

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%
good, look up, please.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I often scratch my head and
try to understand more about

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
how it is that you do the
wonderful work that you do.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.252 align:middle line:84%
Because I understand,
on several levels,

00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
just what you're dealing with
in terms of your vision loss.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you've been able
to do remarkable things

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
beyond what most
artists can do, even

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.238 align:middle line:90%
when they're fully-sighted.

00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the
really most striking and most

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
inspirational features
about knowing you,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and about being able
to take care of you,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is that you really pushed
the envelope beyond what

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I think most people can do.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
could just understand

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:84%
it a little bit better, and
bottle that up, and give

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that to some of
my other patients,

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll be able
to help a lot of people.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think you really serve
as an inspiration on how

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:90%
you can work through loss.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And the role of
resilience in that,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
meaning, basically, if you're
down, you pick yourself up.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And you push yourself forward.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
in resilience and

to pursue our specialties,

a very important topic.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
actually quite ancient,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and that we're just tapping back
into an understanding of what

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
this means, for how to
be successful in the face

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:90%
of adversity.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:84%

an inspiration to us all,
