It's as though we all had a
bank account with $10 million

even realize we had it.

had this bank account.

the bank account

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and begin to learn
how to withdraw money

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
from it, speaking

the other stuff that

We are encouraged to be separate
from the time we are born,

we're given a name, people
start noticing our traits,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and so we begin the
journey of separation.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%

in our mind, in our
ego development.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And as time goes on, we get
more and more solidified

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
in our separate identity,
and we feel more and more

and survive and express

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.295 align:middle line:90%

And then we began to
long for or maybe we've

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
been taught that there's another
world where there's ease,

there's joy, there's grace,
there's beauty, there's bliss,

to experience all that
separation and longing.

And then the second
half of our life

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
we began to get a little
bit of a sense of where

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%

not trusting the world around

me.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And most of my life
was spent trying

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to create a self that would be
loved and accepted and would

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
fit and would be successful
and maybe if I could just

the form of self, if I
could just get that right.

this is insanity to be
navigating all of my choices

00:09:52.450 --> 00:10:00.775 align:middle line:84%
and all of my emotional being
based on thoughts that I'm

00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:01.575 align:middle line:90%
making up.

00:10:01.575 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It's invaluable to move through
the personal development

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
recognizing where we have
disempowering thoughts of self,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
conditioning that
has conditioned

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
us to believe all manner
of things that aren't true.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm not worthy, I don't
belong, I'm not loved,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.195 align:middle line:10%
and start to say, look, these
are not healthy thoughts.

00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:10%
They disempower me.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:10%
I feel small.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%

It's really important
not to leave it there

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
because to really move from
the separation into the oneness

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
is to stop creating
any construct of self.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:25.583 align:middle line:90%

there's no such thing.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%

The way that it works in
this culture and the society

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
is that we're taught
to become somebody.

a mass hypnosis that we're

somebody and we ought

to know what we want to become.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%

the identity,

misunderstanding.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Bit by bit, we feel less
more and more separate.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
That's how it works,
less and less connected

made a significant transition
into wakefulness, let's say.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:84%

of them say is something like,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:90%

would you want self-awareness?

Self-awareness doesn't
take those away

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And I still get
that occasionally,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.895 align:middle line:90%
like, what are you doing?

00:29:20.895 --> 00:29:31.926 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.926 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In self-realization, there's
a great sense of freedom that

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer constrained
into this little thing.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sort
of peace and joy

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and bliss and especially
in the beginning

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.665 align:middle line:90%
because it's just so such a--

00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
it's the immediacy of the
release is so significant.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.844 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:54.844 --> 00:30:04.624 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.624 --> 00:30:08.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Unity is super
enjoyable, super,

00:30:08.445 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:90%
super enjoyable experience.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling one with the
rocks, one with everything,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:90%
one with you.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like sublime.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:50.619 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.619 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The basic quality of the
awake mind and the awake heart

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a sense of
unity or integration or a sort

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.790 align:middle line:84%
of knowingness that
accepts everything.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.602 align:middle line:84%
It really feels like you're
in a state of you walked in

00:31:32.602 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of
corny, but there's

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:84%
a kind of like a shower of a
love or happiness or something

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.755 align:middle line:90%
that's constantly in the heart.

00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.180 align:middle line:90%
So I lead a regular life.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I've had a business all my life.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I still have a business.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I do art, but
regular life goes on.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.435 align:middle line:84%
My wife will tell me not
to do this or to do that.

00:32:01.435 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] All the same,
the personality traits

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and whatever individuality
I have hasn't gone away.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
My daily life is just
like everybody's life

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:90%
with a little addition.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It said on top of my regular
life, my normal life, the life

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that everybody leads, I have the
experience of this awake self,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and I have this experience
of this divine level.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.815 align:middle line:90%
And it's all there together.

00:32:36.815 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.460 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to do here
or what I've done here

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.960 align:middle line:84%
is kind of if you notice
there's a normal landscape going

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:11.367 align:middle line:84%
on here all the way to having
a water tower and a fence

00:33:11.367 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm showing the
layers of creation.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.605 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you could equate
this with more divine levels

00:33:21.605 --> 00:33:22.730 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like
a superimposition

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.440 align:middle line:90%
on top of regular life.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But by that, I don't mean
it's hidden-- hiding anything.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So all these different layers
have a unified quality to it.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Pure consciousness you could say
is the white background that's

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.178 align:middle line:90%
shining through everywhere.

00:33:46.178 --> 00:34:22.532 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.532 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So part of the unity every
little thing got included,

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.339 align:middle line:84%
like, and now
this, and now this.

00:34:31.339 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:90%
This is it too.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:90%
This is God.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the divine, everything,
every little feeling,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
even the things we don't like
and we wish we're different,

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and that's OK to want
something to be different.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:84%
That just comes from a whole
different place when you're not

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:90%
feeling divided inside.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And sure, we have
our preferences,

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.880 align:middle line:84%
preferences of foods,
preferences of people.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
we don't feel the connection.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that some
people get confused about.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.560 align:middle line:84%
How can you still
have preferences?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.040 align:middle line:84%
How can you still have
even political opinions?

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that
everything, everything

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:90%
is part of it.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is left out.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, if
everything's one,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that means everything's
one, that nothing

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.907 align:middle line:90%
is apart from that.

00:35:20.907 --> 00:35:28.797 align:middle line:90%


00:35:28.797 --> 00:35:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then anything that
happens on the inside

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.047 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen
on the outside.

00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So how you-- this
feeling the wholeness

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.230 align:middle line:84%
within the undivided
nature is what I call it.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you perceive all
of life in that way.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't see division anymore.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And so all judgment fell away.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.756 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:46.756 --> 00:35:53.277 align:middle line:90%


00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing that you're
experiencing is yourself.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
wonderful time.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful time, but
it's also a time of undoing.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is lying
there, whatever

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:84%
unresolved issues, feelings,
pain body, traumas,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that's the-- this is the time
when it all comes up to be

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:90%
integrated into wholeness.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we start to feel
the intelligence of life.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.790 align:middle line:84%
We know ourselves as
that intelligence.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And so then it's
hard to see anything

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:49.980 align:middle line:84%
as apart from that intelligence,
including this Earth, nature.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we-- the more
that we get quiet inside,

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
the more that we can
hear it speak to us.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:90%
It's vibration.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:90%
It's intelligence.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not any less
intelligent than we are.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And we've forgotten.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.615 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten through our
feeling, suffered inside

00:37:11.615 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that everything in creation
is alive, whole, and has

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:90%
intelligence to it.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people can relate
to the idea of oneness

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.830 align:middle line:90%
intellectually.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And science certainly deals
with, especially physics.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they say that
the more fundamentally

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.720 align:middle line:84%
you look at nature,
the more unified it is.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.620 align:middle line:84%
To take an example, trees, you
have all different varieties

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:90%
of trees.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
what they're made of,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you get down to a certain
number of compounds or elements,

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:90%
molecules, whatever.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And then if you look at
what those are made of,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:84%
you get down to a
fewer number, molecule.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Molecules are made of atoms.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Atoms are made of electrons and
whatever, subatomic particles.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, physics seeks
to find a unified field which

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
would be sort of a single
constituent ultimate source

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:84%
or foundation of the
universe and actually

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.975 align:middle line:84%
has-- it has succeeded in
doing that to a great extent.

00:38:43.975 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So creation appears
very diverse.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:90%
People appear very diverse.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Their opinions are
diverse and so on.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And diversity is
the spice of life.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Diversity is great.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, fundamentally,
all of this diversity

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.290 align:middle line:90%
is just one thing.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.425 align:middle line:84%
We appear diverse, but we're
really all the same soul.

00:39:23.425 --> 00:39:24.550 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same essence.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We're all the same
consciousness,

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.885 align:middle line:84%
and that means that there's
really only one of us.

00:39:28.885 --> 00:39:43.114 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I view humanity as all the
different people that make up

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.490 align:middle line:84%
our world, is like individual
cells in this one cosmic body

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:90%
of oneness.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, there's some
individuality there,

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
but there's a harmony
and interrelationship

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.880 align:middle line:90%
between all people, really.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.455 align:middle line:90%
I'm you, and you're me.

00:40:07.455 --> 00:40:19.608 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.608 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard people describe
the experience of unity

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:84%
or unity consciousness, and
that's what I'm describing.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm describing a
unification of the inside

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
with the outside of this silent
levels of self-knowingness

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.230 align:middle line:84%
with the regular
levels of my senses,

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.010 align:middle line:84%
when I see stuff,
hear stuff, do stuff.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:90%
The outside is not the outside.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not separated from you.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a unification or
a see through, know

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:90%
through oneness of experience.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:90%

>> We're all on this
evolutionary train,

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:90%
know it or not.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Now at a certain stage,
we begin to know it.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It becomes conscious
rather than just kind

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:90%
of an automatic process.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those
stages are abrupt.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Someone has a sudden awakening.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:84%
They might have been seeking
it, doing spiritual practices,

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.550 align:middle line:84%
or they might just be tying
their shoes one morning

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
boom, this shift

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:90%
takes place in their awareness.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And they think,
whoa, what happened?

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.640 align:middle line:84%
What I thought myself to
be I can no longer find,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and that can take a
long time to adjust to.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say that
most people don't

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.900 align:middle line:84%
have these dramatic shifts that
take a long time to adjust to.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Some famous people do.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Eckhart Tolle did.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:84%
He was depressed and
even possibly suicidal.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:31.832 align:middle line:84%
And one night, he said, I can't
live with myself any longer.

00:43:31.832 --> 00:43:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he thought,
wait a minute.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.123 align:middle line:90%
Are there two of me?

00:43:34.123 --> 00:43:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Who is this self with
whom I cannot live?

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.205 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up-- and
he went to sleep,

00:43:38.205 --> 00:43:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and he woke up in the morning
and everything had shifted.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And he never went back.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Many people aren't that
abrupt in their transition,

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and they progress more
gradually and incrementally.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:44:04.016 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Awakening to non-separateness
actually requires certain

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.130 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to
find a copacetic map,

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.400 align:middle line:84%
a map that suits
you in the moment

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:90%
to take you to the next level.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And finding that map is
often another initiation.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I know there have been in
my life certain books I

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:90%
read that felt so right.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I found myself
saying, why didn't anyone

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.935 align:middle line:90%
ever tell me this?

00:44:39.935 --> 00:44:41.609 align:middle line:90%

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to have some kind
of guidance to the territory,

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:90%
and that's very, very helpful.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You could find out on your
own by trial and error,

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.670 align:middle line:84%
but you might find
out more quickly

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:90%
by having an experienced guide.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And then next you need to
have a group of people.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I have discovered on my teaching
experience and my own awakening

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.665 align:middle line:84%
that almost no one can awaken
absolutely on their own.

00:45:14.665 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I once remember
in a group saying

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to a person who was going
through an experience

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:34.570 align:middle line:84%
of encountering illness
and distress about it

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and speaking about it.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just suddenly felt,
oh, yeah, I know that.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:45.140 align:middle line:84%
She's myself who's suffering
a limit of her body mind.

>> So in order to
gain self-awareness,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.180 align:middle line:84%
you have to actually
do something.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to either meditate,
you have to do self-inquiry,

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:90%
you have to go for it.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
come all by itself.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:02.720 align:middle line:90%
You have to go for it.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I've meditated for
years and years.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I still meditate, and I
have this experience just

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:90%
for-- because I enjoy it.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.830 align:middle line:90%
You're not a seeker for nothing.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:16.770 align:middle line:84%
A seeker means you're after
something, you want something,

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.230 align:middle line:90%
you're going for it.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.156 align:middle line:84%
And if you have your own
way of doing that, fine.

00:46:22.156 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, there are
techniques and procedures

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.575 align:middle line:84%
that you can use to
enhance your experience.

00:46:28.575 --> 00:46:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I can just sit here
like this and meditate,

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:90%
just no one would even know.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.585 align:middle line:84%
I could do it on a plane
or train or whatever.

teachings, there are practices,

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.890 align:middle line:84%
there are methods which anybody
can do which will enable

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.220 align:middle line:84%
people, anyone, to start
experiencing these things

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.050 align:middle line:90%

>> So you develop
self-awareness,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
it has a quality of
silence and expansion,

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:90%
and everybody can have that.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
begin to experience

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that silence and
its expressions,

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.980 align:middle line:84%
it gets very different
for everybody.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people only they
sense pure consciousness.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:90%
They don't see it.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people hear
some reverberation

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well,
I can hear it.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.240 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful, this sound.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Other people would
be very heartfelt,

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and they just feel their
way through all this stuff.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's all very,
very different,

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.560 align:middle line:84%
except on the ground state it
has similarities, expansion,

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.480 align:middle line:90%
bliss, love, these things.

>> How do I experience
that oneness?

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It could be on a very quiet
subtle level of just feeling

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:90%
at home and oneness.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It could also be
on a sensory level.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm an artist, and
so sometimes there's

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:49.030 align:middle line:84%
some subtle kind of
visual components to this,

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.620 align:middle line:84%
you could say, like, threads,
golden threads connecting

00:48:53.620 --> 00:49:04.570 align:middle line:84%
all of us or a transparency
or a sparkling of that

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:11.000 align:middle line:84%
which is lively in me, also in
you, that lively bliss oneness.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It could also be on the
level of hearing as well.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.450 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, I started to have
an unusual experience that

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:90%
completely caught me off guard.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I was just sitting
meditating, and I

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:53.120 align:middle line:84%
heard these most glorious
sounds I'd never heard before.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I opened my eyes.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I looked around.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.460 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a radio on.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a TV.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.910 align:middle line:84%
There was no choir
outside my apartment.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't coming
from outside.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to hear
it on a regular basis.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear to me it was
sounds of what I call veda.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
To me, veda, that's, V-E-D-A,
it's pure knowledge flowing.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.200 align:middle line:90%
It's that oneness, that peace.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.050 align:middle line:90%
There's some movement there.

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And when there's movement,
there's some sound created.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of it as the
sound of the laws of nature,

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I would say the innate
sounds of life in creation.

a fascination with objects,

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed it first
with natural things, like,

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.895 align:middle line:90%
plants or trees or flowers.

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.270 align:middle line:84%
There's just
something about them

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that caught my attention
more than usual.

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at them, it
was like I felt initially

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
that there was
something behind them

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.080 align:middle line:84%
that I could just
have a vague sense of.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite know what it
was, but I had to keep looking.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:30.560 align:middle line:10%
I had to keep looking because
my status at that time was, OK,

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.010 align:middle line:10%
here is this unbounded
awareness that's simply present.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:39.245 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all this
other stuff, that's the world,

00:51:39.245 --> 00:51:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and those are things,
and those are people.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.805 align:middle line:90%
And I don't really know what--

00:51:43.805 --> 00:51:44.930 align:middle line:90%
nothing's really different.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.460 align:middle line:90%
They look the same.

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So as I continued
to pay attention

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to this drawing,
this magnetizing

00:51:52.460 --> 00:52:00.090 align:middle line:84%
quality behind the plant
or the flower, it got--

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:03.110 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to describe it,
like, it became porous.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, there were little, tiny
holes forming everywhere,

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and then something was
coming through those holes.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
began to recognize,

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:18.680 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is the self there.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:24.890 align:middle line:10%
And there was just the
prominent feature of perception

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:31.850 align:middle line:10%
that whatever I was
experiencing its nature as self

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.520 align:middle line:10%
was there in front of me first.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I recognized that first.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing everything with
this predominant quality

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.645 align:middle line:84%
of self, but then all
of it became one thing.

00:52:44.645 --> 00:52:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard to
really describe.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, then
perception also changed again.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.410 align:middle line:84%
There was like
some final merging

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that took place where the
subject and the object

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.510 align:middle line:90%
had just completely merged.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't a subject
perceiving an object,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a
sense of a subject

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.910 align:middle line:90%
or a sense of an object.

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:15.690 align:middle line:84%
There was just the
flow of experience,

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.230 align:middle line:84%

really, really nice.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It just you're just moving
and just experiencing that.

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.445 align:middle line:84%
And that was how the
experience became.

00:53:41.445 --> 00:53:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:00.570 align:middle line:84%
That flowing of
experience had begun.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And once that began,
then time started

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:12.565 align:middle line:84%
to disappear because that
flow is every moment.

00:54:12.565 --> 00:54:15.625 align:middle line:90%

in my experience,

timelessness was an

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Then that stabilized.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.890 align:middle line:90%

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.300 align:middle line:84%
which actually I didn't have
very many thoughts left.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no more
thinking about itself,

But in order for

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.210 align:middle line:90%
there has to be some motivation.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The divine epitomizes
love, and out of its love

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:50.810 align:middle line:84%
for itself is the
way I Intuit this.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Out of its love for
itself, it begins

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to move in a way to
create a circuit,

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's the origin
of consciousness.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like out of
its love for itself,

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
it reflects back on itself, and
this reflecting back on itself

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
creates a sense of being.

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness is born
out of the divine, and then

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
everything that's borne out
of consciousness on the basis

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
of what we would call being.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Then the divine is
present in that as well.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:43.280 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So the way I look at it is that
all of this process born out

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
of love is for the
divine to have a way

01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
to look into this world to us.

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So we become a living
presence of the divine,

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:09.395 align:middle line:84%
and our experience is the
enjoyment of the divine.

01:06:09.395 --> 01:06:19.066 align:middle line:90%


01:06:19.066 --> 01:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%

aspects to it as far as I know.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%

are many more.

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%

center inside of us,

life or anything else.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%

to engage in life
more fulfillingly.

01:08:59.852 --> 01:09:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen time and time again
with people as they develop

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in these higher states
of consciousness that

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.859 align:middle line:84%
they're living their birthright,
and they're experiencing more

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:15.399 align:middle line:84%
happiness because they're
connected like an appliance

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
into the electrical outlet
is finally hooked up.

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:24.560 align:middle line:90%


01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.010 align:middle line:10%
I think that once we
have more inner harmony,

01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:30.950 align:middle line:10%
then we're going to radiate
more harmony outside,

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:35.540 align:middle line:10%
and it will be like tuning forks
to each other or that theory

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.350 align:middle line:10%
of resonance.

01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
You pluck one guitar
string, and then the other

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
starts to vibrate.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.082 align:middle line:84%
So one person will be vibrating
in bliss and happiness and then

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:46.040 align:middle line:84%
another and another, and
then pretty soon we'll

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.974 align:middle line:84%
have this glorious choir of a
harmony throughout creation.

01:09:50.974 --> 01:09:59.028 align:middle line:90%


01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If a significant percentage
of the population could wake up

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, I think the
outer environment would change

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.192 align:middle line:90%
dramatically.

01:10:09.192 --> 01:10:12.330 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't even have to
have an intention to improve

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:17.190 align:middle line:10%
the world, but you will be
drawn into creating with other

01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:21.490 align:middle line:10%
people, co-creating,
manifesting a different world,

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:24.460 align:middle line:10%
a different environment,
new potential.

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if more people
were in this state of oneness,

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I think people will
be more powerful.

01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Talents, hidden talents
will come to the surface.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I think special
abilities, intuition

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
will be clear because there
won't be that chaos and just

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%
harmonious thinking and feeling.

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I think people will
make fewer mistakes.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
We will find that all the
wasted energy in self-criticism

01:10:57.070 --> 01:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and condemnation of
others and feeling fear

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and concern and helping people
will like you and all this.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So much mental and energy
and emotional energy

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
is put into these
kinds of things.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Instead we could be
solving big problems that

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
need to be solved
for our environment

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
for creating new
technology that would

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
help on the level of health or
all so many other ways as well.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So we could use our creative
intelligence more fruitfully.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:40.574 align:middle line:90%


01:11:40.574 --> 01:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are we
climbing mountains?

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Why are we chasing money?

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.475 align:middle line:90%
We want more.

01:11:46.475 --> 01:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
That more that we
really want is already

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.840 align:middle line:84%
self-existent within the
heart and within the mind

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.475 align:middle line:90%
of everybody.

01:11:55.475 --> 01:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it is a secret,
but it doesn't need to be.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
In my life, I've certainly
seen that there's

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
more and more people who are
realizing and experiencing

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.355 align:middle line:90%
the self.

01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But that oneness that
is alive and it's happening

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
so quickly, so rapidly
around the planet right now.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.185 align:middle line:84%
So many people are feeling
this sense of unity.

01:12:19.185 --> 01:12:27.112 align:middle line:90%


01:12:27.112 --> 01:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We're actually returning back
to what we were meant to be.

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But the journey itself
is not a mistake.

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:39.610 align:middle line:84%
The journey itself
we learn so much.

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And we, what we are, of
course, is the divine.

01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:46.724 align:middle line:84%
We're the divine
experiencing all this.

really is going to happen

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
whether we're on
board for it or not.

01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's just fun to
get on board for it,

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to join with other people and
just the pleasure of expressing

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
our creative nature along
with the divine creator.
