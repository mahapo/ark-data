00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>What if a person's
last words were actually

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.370 align:middle line:84%
the first words they
say in the afterlife?

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.980 align:middle line:84%
On her deathbed, my
close friend said

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.573 align:middle line:84%
she thought she was going to
another galaxy after her death.

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:84%
She said she had a recurring
vision she was in a classroom,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
with everyone dressed in white,
in a class about spirituality.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.906 align:middle line:10%
And some months
after her death, I

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
had a spontaneous
out-of-body experience,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:10%
where she guided me to
that place, her galaxy.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:10%
I felt I had actually
been to visit my dear

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.641 align:middle line:10%
friend in her new
part of the universe.

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.573 align:middle line:10%
Was it a dream?

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:47.988 align:middle line:10%
Or did I really find her?

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:52.615 align:middle line:10%
And how could I
go back on my own?

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.378 align:middle line:10%
I began studying near death
experiences, past life

00:00:55.378 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:10%
memories, reincarnation.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.897 align:middle line:10%
Prevailing science tells
us we make these things up.

00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Michael Newton
is a hypnotherapist

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.874 align:middle line:84%
who spent his life studying
patients under deep hypnosis.

00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:11.112 align:middle line:84%
He claimed with
sufficient trance depth,

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
clients could take him to
areas of the subconscious that

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
remembered not only past
lives, but life between lives

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that they say we all
journey after death.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
7,000 patients who had
never met saying basically

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the same things under deep
hypnosis about the afterlife.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I was determined to
go on this journey

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and see if what they were
saying could possibly be true.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:10%
>>You are now looking
upon a hypnotized person.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:10%
Notice how the
eyes of the subject

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:10%
gaze out blankly into space.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Even the close flame
of a match before them

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.632 align:middle line:10%
causes no flickering
of the eyelids.

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:10%
This is a state that resembles
sleep, yet actually is not

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:10%
sleep as we normally know it.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:10%
This subject is being
conditioned for anesthesia

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:10%
so as to feel no pain
in the experiment that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:10%
is going to take place.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:10%
No pain whatsoever is
experienced by a person

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:10%
under the hypnotic influence.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:10%
Indeed, the mind
has unique power

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.323 align:middle line:10%
to block off pain under--
has been of great importance

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:10%
to the hypnotherapist.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:10%
>>A typical Life
Between Life regression

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:10%
is at least four and
a half hours long.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:10%
And the reason it
has to be so long

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:10%
is because one needs to achieve
a certain level of trance depth

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:10%
in order to access the
superconscious mind.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:10%
Now the superconscious
mind is the mind

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.786 align:middle line:10%
that has the soul memories.

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
The body, the physical
body, has a mind of its own,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:90%
a type of physical ego.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And this physical ego is quite
different to the soul's minds,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:90%
or the soul's ego.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:10%
So the challenge for
the LBL therapist

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:10%
is to attain enough
trance depth to bypass

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:10%
the conscious mind
and its ability

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:10%
to interfere with the
superconscious mind.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:10%
So here you have
your soul's memories

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:10%
trying to come through,
or your soul's wisdom

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:10%
trying to come through.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And the human body and the human
mind often is like a bouncer

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
preventing those deep thoughts
or those deep wisdoms or truths

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:90%
from coming though.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>A client called me and
asked if I could see him

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
with regard to
physical pain that he

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
was feeling in his
side, his left side.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said he'd been troubled
from childhood with this.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that the doctors all
said it was psychosomatic.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
They'd done x-rays
and they found out

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that he was simply
someone that they

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
couldn't bother with anymore.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:84%
They could find no
physical symptoms.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
And a number of them
told him that he

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:90%
should see a psychologist.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I gave in the
command, I want you

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:90%
go to the origin of this pain.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was getting a
little ahead of me.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
He was actually a little
deeper than I thought.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And he jumped into the past life
as a soldier in World War I.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And he was being bayoneted.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:90%
He was a British sergeant.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
battle of the Somme.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 1916.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe what
was happening to me.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
This fellow was lying
in the mud and groaning,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.355 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to
get his arm patch

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
information, because
I am a historian.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I was more interested in trying
to verify the British unit

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that he claimed to be with
and a number of other facts

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.591 align:middle line:84%
instead of gently desensitizing
this horrible trauma he

00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:90%
was going through.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And eventually I did do that.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So, when it was
all over, he said

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:90%
he was feeling better already.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And he calked me a few
days later, and he said,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.385 align:middle line:90%
there's no more pain.

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
My wife really
wants to thank you.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wasn't
satisfied with that.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:10%
I didn't tell him this, but
I contacted the British war

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:10%
office and the imperial
museum in London

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:10%
to find out if this British
sergeant ever existed

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:10%
and if there was such a
person in this particular unit

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:10%
that he described
as the fourth core.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, there
was such a person.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And he existed.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Any he died in 1916.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So from that case, I began
taking past life clients.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:10%
So I came kicking and
screaming into this movement.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.925 align:middle line:10%
>>I was doing regression,
not past life,

00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:10%
but regressing back to cause.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And so put him in
hypnosis, took him back

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to the origins of this
chronic infection problem.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And he spontaneously
regressed into past life.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really even know
exactly what it was at first.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
But he actually abreacted.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:10%
He had a sort of a re-living of
the death that he experienced.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:10%
And first he described himself
as a small child in Greece.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And he described the sea as
this crystalline, blue sea,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
with something kind of shiny
down in the bottom at the beach

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And he bent over to
pick something up

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.292 align:middle line:84%
and actually fell off a ledge
into the water and drowned.

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And he began to
drown in my office.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:90%
He turned blue.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.735 align:middle line:84%
He foamed and
scared me to death.

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But I'd learned in my
training if someone abreacts,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.193 align:middle line:84%
to just take them through it,
and not to shock them out.

00:06:41.193 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:90%
We sort of followed through it.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.976 align:middle line:10%
And he never had another
infection after that.

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:52.602 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.602 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>>And we're just going to
bring some beautiful energy

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:10%
into the room.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:10%
Because Nancy's here and
she's doing a great job.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got Marco here
in the wizard's chair.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.989 align:middle line:84%
We've got [INAUDIBLE]
[LAUGHTER ] setting the energy

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:90%
here in the middle.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is really sacred
space in the middle here.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:10%
So I won't be here long.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:10%
But, uh-- [LAUGHTER]
So can I just

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:10%
get you to go with
him for a moment?

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.955 align:middle line:10%
>>Take a moment just to observe
any of the thoughts that

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:22.557 align:middle line:10%
are running through your mind.

00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:30.349 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>People are dying around me.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>People are dying?

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:10%
>>And what are you doing?

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>>We're rounded up.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>>Rounded up?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:10%
>>Mhm.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
We're in a camp.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.332 align:middle line:90%
>>A camp?

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:46.831 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.961 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you can hover above
the scene if you prefer.

00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>[EXHALES]

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening?

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>People die because
they're hungry.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.591 align:middle line:90%
>>Ah, they're hungry.

00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>They're hungry, and
[EXHALES] some are taken away.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Newburg?

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.892 align:middle line:10%
Something like that?

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:55.057 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:15:55.057 --> 00:15:55.765 align:middle line:10%
That's all right.

00:15:55.765 --> 00:15:57.521 align:middle line:10%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:58.515 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:15:58.515 --> 00:16:00.503 align:middle line:90%
>>I love my sheep.

00:16:00.503 --> 00:16:01.545 align:middle line:90%
>>You love your sheep?

00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>And my [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>So typically it starts
with an induction, then

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
a deepening, a
deepening of trance.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we use this lifetime
through current life age

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
regression as a way to
warm the person's mind up,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
making it ready and available
to superconscious memory.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:10%
Then from the current
life, we go back

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:10%
to the womb, where the person
is able to recount and recall

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:10%
the experience of being
in the womb as a fetus.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And then from the womb, we move
back into a past life memory,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
specifically looking
for the death scene.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Because we have found that
through the death scene,

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
the person's mind is more easily
able to open to their soul

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:90%
memories.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So the person passes
through the death scene,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
starts to experience in
themselves as a soul,

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
remembers what it
is to be a soul,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and then there is usually
a sequence of events that

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
are quite similar
for most people,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
although they can be
in different orders.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of
orientation, where they

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
are met by a loving soul
mate, a friend in spirit,

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
or their teacher or
their guides in spirit.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, there is
an orientation as well as

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
a debriefing of the life
that they have just lived.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the soul moves
into the normal activities

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit world.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this might involve
some kind of celebration, where

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
they are reunited with their
spiritual friends and family.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's
even a bit of rest.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Very often the soul,
carrying the baggage

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of a human experience,
needs some kind

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
of healing on the other side to
fully acclimatize to its soul

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there is usually
healing or restoration.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And then at some
point, the soul is

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:10%
taken before it's council or
it's wise elders or teaches,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:10%
where the soul, in a very
loving, caring and supportive

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:10%
way, is given the opportunity to
reflect on the life just lived

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:10%
and on the bigger picture
of their many existences,

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:10%
their many lifetimes, where they
review the lessons, the themes,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:10%
that are part of their
own spiritual journey

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.048 align:middle line:10%
and their own
spiritual unfoldment.

00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:40.881 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.881 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>>Number one, be there now.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.925 align:middle line:10%
Move out of the tunnel.

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:45.316 align:middle line:10%
Be there now.

00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:46.765 align:middle line:10%
>>Mhm.

00:18:46.765 --> 00:18:52.122 align:middle line:10%
>>Here I am on some place in
Europe, seems like London.

00:18:52.122 --> 00:18:52.622 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:52.622 --> 00:18:53.705 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it daytime right now?

00:18:53.705 --> 00:18:54.518 align:middle line:90%
>>It's daytime.

00:18:54.518 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I have on--
you know that hat,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
like a black hat, a big
black hat and black suit

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:90%
like Snidely Whiplash?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I'm moving
along the London streets.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm slinking around the
London streets like a cat.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:10%
What can I say?

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.557 align:middle line:10%
>>And so you're outside
moving through the streets,

00:19:16.557 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:10%
is that right?

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I'm looking
for-- I've got

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:90%
some-- I'm shielding something.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking for something.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding it.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:22.845 align:middle line:90%
>>Your garments?

00:19:22.845 --> 00:19:23.553 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm holding it.

00:19:23.553 --> 00:19:26.137 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, kind of pushing it into
my jacket so nobody will see it.

00:19:26.137 --> 00:19:26.636 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:19:26.636 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>It's in my top coat.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And you feel you
sort of made off

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
with this from a
church or something?

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Either-- yeah.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Definitely from a church.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.359 align:middle line:84%
Either they gave it to me
to deliver to somebody--

00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>What's your name?

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:90%
What do people call you?

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:90%
What's the first letter?

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Alfred.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Alfred.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, Alfred is now very--
he's now-- he feels confused.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:10%
He feels, now wait a minute.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:10%
I have the document.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.995 align:middle line:10%
I don't know where
to go with it.

00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Why did they give it to me if I
don't know where to deliver it?

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.105 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.105 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:10%
>>--it was more
clinically oriented.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:10%
But about eight years ago, I
had a near death experience.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I was at my son's
swim meet and was

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
struck by lightning, about 50
million volts through the body.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It actually went through
my body, out of it,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.194 align:middle line:84%
into the car, burned out the
electrical system in the car.

00:20:19.194 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of
the lucky ones who

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:90%
survives that sort of thing.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And about six months later,
had a hypnosis session,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
a regression session,
back to take me

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
back through that to release
some of the trauma that

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:90%
was lodged in my body.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It was during that session that
I remembered the near death

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:84%
In the dead time, I
experienced a couple things

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that have stayed
with me ever since.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And one is we can have a
concept or a philosophy

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
or a religious belief
about unconditional love.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it's a
common, everyday experience.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:90%
We can strive for it.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
We can hope to experience,
we can long for it.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:90%
But I felt two things.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
One was a complete
reconnecting with the whole,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
with the all being,
part of it all again,

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
this universal sea of
consciousness, if you will,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
this being back home
and being completely

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and unconditionally loved.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is something I thought,
how can I recreate that?

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
How can I take someone to
have that experience again

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.530 align:middle line:84%
in this Life Between
Life regression?

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Not always, but most
often, as someone

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
goes back into spirit from the
death scene in the past life,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
as you heard yesterday,
some of the first words

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.924 align:middle line:84%
she spoke once she was
there is, I'm home.

00:21:45.924 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm home.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's that
longing for home, longing

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
for that sense of love, that
we as human beings carry.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And we look for it
in relationships.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't find it.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
We try to numb it, the
pain that we carry.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's there and it's available.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a
great avenue to get there.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>And then what happens?

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>We're told, a group
of us, that we're

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:90%
going to take showers.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And we all know that we're not.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Showers.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>We hope so.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
We hope that we're
going to be moved

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
to a more comfortable
place and have better food.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of me that
just wants to scream and fight.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But there's another part
that says, just stay small,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.684 align:middle line:90%
stay connected.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Ah.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Stay and fight or stay
small and stay connected.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.706 align:middle line:84%
>>Stay connected and
remember that love

00:22:38.706 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:90%
is what really matters.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we go into the place
where the showers are.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And there is such a
funny smell all the time.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.029 align:middle line:84%
The odor is-- we smell
that other times.

00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>So before we go in there,
just tell me, if you would,

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:90%
what your name is.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Ana.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Ana.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Mhm.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.326 align:middle line:90%
>>And last name?

00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Pachinski.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.885 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.885 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes, OK.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:10%
So moving quickly now into
the showers-- that's right--

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.063 align:middle line:10%
and notice where you are
in relation to your body.

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.504 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm.

00:23:22.504 --> 00:23:23.004 align:middle line:90%
>>Mhm.

00:23:23.004 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>It's over pretty quickly.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:27.823 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:28.948 align:middle line:90%
>>It's over pretty quickly.

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:31.428 align:middle line:90%
>>Mhm.

00:23:31.428 --> 00:23:32.908 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:33.908 align:middle line:90%
We're gathered together.

00:23:33.908 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We're pressed
against each other.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.097 align:middle line:84%
And there's commotion, and
I'm just trying to stay calm.

00:23:41.097 --> 00:23:45.299 align:middle line:84%
And I take deep breaths
so it can be over faster.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>You take deep breaths
so it can be over faster.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.244 align:middle line:90%
>>Deep breaths, yeah.

00:23:48.244 --> 00:23:49.148 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:23:49.148 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>And then it's done.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.511 align:middle line:90%
>>It's done.

00:23:52.511 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>[SIGHS]

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And are you moving
away from the body now?

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:54.919 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:56.672 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:23:56.672 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And is there a sense
of being pulled away

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.715 align:middle line:84%
or moving away of
your own [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:59.715 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Pulling away.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Pulling away.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And as you move away, are you
looking back towards the body,

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:90%
or towards where you're going?

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm looking upwards.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.672 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:24:06.672 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And what do you see?

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I just see kind of--
it's dark at first,

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and then there seems to
be lights all around me.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm moving very quickly.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting lighter.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>There are lights all around.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.984 align:middle line:90%
It's getting lighter.

00:24:27.984 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>There's lights all around me,
very bright lights all around.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm just moving
very, very quickly.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.338 align:middle line:90%
>>Good, good.

00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:33.194 align:middle line:90%
>>Very quickly.

00:24:33.194 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Sometime later, a woman
came to me, my first Life

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Between Life case.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And her presenting
problem was one

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of depression over having,
quote, "no friends."

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't seem to
connect with anybody.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And there was a kind
of a dissociation

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:90%
there with human society.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't understand it.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And she felt she was
kind of reclusive.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was dealing
with a case of depression.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, once again, as with
the World War I soldier,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I reached a point
of frustration when

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't seem to
find any of her--

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought perhaps
there might be someone

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
from her past life
in her life today.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't seem find anyone.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So I said, go to the
origin of your loneliness,

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:84%
especially if there are a
group of people around you.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't know
it at the time,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:84%
but the word "group"
was a trigger word.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we exist between lives
in soul groups, cluster groups,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:90%
we call them.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, her face lit up.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
She got tears in her eyes.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And she-- once again, she'd
gone very deep very quickly.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:10%
Because this is not something
in a middle or shallow alpha

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:10%
state.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And she pointed to my office
wall and said, I see them all.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm lost.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, you see
them all in this life

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:84%
or in your most
immediate past life?

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she said, we're
in the spirit world.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.526 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you're where?

00:26:14.526 --> 00:26:18.584 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, she said, I'm seeing
all my soul companions.

00:26:18.584 --> 00:26:20.125 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're all--
they're wonderful.

00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And she began to
describe them to me.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I probed some
more, took a lot of notes.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:90%
I had a recording.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And like the World
War I soldier,

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I found out that, in her case,
none of these soul companions

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
were in her life today, and
there were reasons for that.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was lonely
because of it.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And then after she left,
I looked at the wall,

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and said to myself, this
can't be happening to me.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I am the world's worst
cynical, skeptic.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And past life was another
jolt of cold water.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And now this?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:10%
So, I studied it for a long
time, my notes and the tape.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course,
with more clients,

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:10%
I began exploring
it more and more.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.796 align:middle line:84%
And once I started,
I couldn't stop.

00:27:14.796 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:10%
>>Now do this for
me, Alfred, I want

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.992 align:middle line:10%
to move forward to the
very last day of your life

00:27:26.992 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:10%
as Alfred, the very last day.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:10%
>>Mhm.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.675 align:middle line:10%
>>You'll not yet
have crossed over,

00:27:31.675 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:10%
but it will be the last day.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So on the count of three,
you'll be there, one.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:90%
two, three, last day, so.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.152 align:middle line:90%
>>I've been shot in the chest.

00:27:42.152 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Shot in the chest.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>I met two people behind
me trying to revive me.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.409 align:middle line:90%
So where are you?

00:27:50.409 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
You're outside or inside?

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>And I still am wearing the
same black suit I had on.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:00.106 align:middle line:10%
So I think I got it before I
got the envelope to the French.

00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>So right now, as you're
dying there, are you inside?

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.421 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I'm outside on the street.

00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.622 align:middle line:84%
>>I have a white
shirt on, and blood

00:28:12.622 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:90%
is oozing out of my chest.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.124 align:middle line:84%
>>Where are you hit
exactly, do you know?

00:28:17.124 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Right in the heart.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.992 align:middle line:90%
>>Right in the heart, OK.

00:28:19.992 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.891 align:middle line:90%
Did you see who shot you?

00:28:24.891 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.807 align:middle line:84%
>>Or was it just a shot
that came out of nowhere?

00:28:27.807 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I don't know who did it.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>But they were looking for me.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WHAT about the-- Did
you see who shot you?

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just a shot
that came out of nowhere?

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I don't know who did it.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:90%
But they were looking for me.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.876 align:middle line:84%
>>So as you-- are
you laying down?

00:28:49.876 --> 00:28:50.775 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:28:50.775 --> 00:28:51.274 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:28:51.274 --> 00:28:53.265 align:middle line:84%
And the life's sort of
draining out of you.

00:28:53.265 --> 00:28:54.195 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:28:54.195 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
document, or the precious--

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>A structure of
the spirit world.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's
definitely a-- is not

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:84%
just a few clouds and
people playing harps.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing like that.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex-- you could
say society, but one in which

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.550 align:middle line:84%
there are none of the
human limitations.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't have the human needs.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can afford hoard the
jelly beans or the gold.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:90%
There isn't anything to hoard.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:90%
There's no power to hoard.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
There's not really a
hierarchy, although you

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:84%
have very advanced
souls and souls

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:90%
that are ranked beginners.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Souls don't see
that as a hierarchy.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
The very advanced souls-- part
of becoming an advanced soul

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more and more
and more selfless and humble.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And they don't see themselves
as one bit more important

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:84%
or special than the
youngest of souls.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.862 align:middle line:90%
They just don't see it that way.

00:29:53.862 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>We cross from the
death experience

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:84%
into the spirit world,
into the afterlife.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens then is a very
kind of consistent reporting

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
of either friends
or relatives coming

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
to greet them, or their
spirit guides, usually both.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:84%
There's usually what I call
an orientation session.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
a briefing session.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I think back, because
of my age, to World War

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.515 align:middle line:84%
II and those bombing missions
over Europe from England.

00:30:31.515 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You go out, and it's
like going to Earth

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and going through this
very difficult school

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.667 align:middle line:84%
that we have down
here for one lifetime.

00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you get home,
and you're debriefed.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:84%
These pilots, when they came
back to land at English bases,

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:90%
were debriefed.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
How did the mission go?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Did you reach the target?

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Did you accomplish
your objectives?

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are the same
sorts of questions we ask.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:90%
How does your guide receive you?

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to make it clear
that when a client sees

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
their personal guide
for the first time,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
their immortal teacher, they're
blown out of their minds.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Because that conscious
is never fully asleep.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And if it were, we wouldn't be
getting answers and responses.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%
They can't believe it.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more
religious people

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:84%
may think that they see
Jesus or Buddha or Mohammed

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:90%
coming towards them.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But they quickly realize, no,
no, no, that's not who this.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.530 align:middle line:90%
This is my personal teacher.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Where are you in
relation to your body,

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:33.430 align:middle line:84%
floating above it,
or off to the side?

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I'm floating above it.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.948 align:middle line:90%
>>Floating above it.

00:31:36.948 --> 00:31:37.448 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:41.195 align:middle line:84%
Floating above, but
I'm in a chamber.

00:31:41.195 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are three
men, big, powerful men

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:84%
with very big smiles
on their face.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.924 align:middle line:84%
>>Is one of them sort of like
the one you're talking to?

00:31:52.924 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:10%
Or they're all--

00:31:53.590 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, there's one main one
who's kind of having this

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:10%
silent exchange with--

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.990 align:middle line:10%
>>[INAUDIBLE] What's he wearing?

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Big, like Santa Claus, white
robe, big, white beard, jolly.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.981 align:middle line:84%
>>And what's being
communicate to you?

00:32:12.981 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:90%
What do you hear in your mind?

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:90%
What's he saying to you?

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>You've sacrificed your
own self and self-protection

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.363 align:middle line:90%
for those of others.

00:32:23.363 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
We're really happy
to have you up here,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:90%
and we hope you'll stay.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>People are
fascinated to find out

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:84%
who is in this very private
sanctuary of souls that

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.510 align:middle line:84%
can range anywhere
from 3 to 25 souls.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:90%
The average client has about 15.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
These are all friends,
relatives, spouses,

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:90%
dear friends in this life.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
shocked by who's there.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And they have been with
them since the beginning.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like
we hear of groups

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that are formed, say, for
alcoholics in recovery.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
integrity there

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.930 align:middle line:84%
that no new patients
are added to the group

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:90%
once the group starts.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.359 align:middle line:84%
It's that way in
the spirit world.

00:33:07.359 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't have new souls coming
in and out all the time.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:90%
That group stays together.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.735 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's
a real revelation

00:33:14.735 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
to the people sitting
in your chair about just

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:90%
who's in their soul group.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.660 align:middle line:84%
There are other
soul groups nearby,

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
affiliated souls, that
may play an important part

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:90%
in certain lives.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.434 align:middle line:90%
There are reasons for that.

00:33:25.434 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:90%
We want to explore it.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, he has taken
me by the hand.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And he's taken me in
to this vestibule that

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
has rows of men and
women sitting there.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And they have on white
bishop's hats and robes.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's just leading me
into this vestibule where

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to meet-- I guess
that's my council of elders.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, can you think of the
plaza in front of the Vatican

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.895 align:middle line:90%
at Christmas?

00:34:03.895 --> 00:34:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Lit, right?

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Bright, lit like
an atomic blast.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.337 align:middle line:90%
>>Very bright.

00:34:11.337 --> 00:34:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Very bright.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:10%
>>Luminous.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:10%
>>And so it's
bright in the room.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:10%
And everybody is sitting very
straight and magnificent.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.677 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of looking at
me and then looking at them,

00:34:22.677 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:90%
saying, look, look, look.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Look how great this is.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.384 align:middle line:84%
Look at all these
people you have

00:34:27.384 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
around you that are going
to start to maybe give you

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.448 align:middle line:90%
some tender loving care.

00:34:32.448 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:84%
>>Now tell me-- the person that
you mentioned that were angry

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.466 align:middle line:90%
at-- why are you angry at them?

00:34:37.466 --> 00:34:41.962 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.962 --> 00:34:43.777 align:middle line:10%
>>He watched me drowning.

00:34:43.777 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:10%
>>He watched you drowning?

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.144 align:middle line:10%
Did he not do anything?

00:34:48.144 --> 00:34:49.056 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:34:49.056 --> 00:34:50.324 align:middle line:10%
>>He had pleasure in it.

00:34:50.324 --> 00:34:53.200 align:middle line:10%
>>He took pleasure in it.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I can understand that
that would make you angry.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Why did he take pleasure
in it, do you think?

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>When I go down
there, I don't see it.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.280 align:middle line:90%
But up there, I know it.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.162 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHS]

00:35:06.162 --> 00:35:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.636 align:middle line:84%
When you've passed,
you know more?

00:35:09.636 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>He-- we shook hands before
we said-- I don't know.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:90%
It was something.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.115 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we made a contract.

00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I just saw that shook
hands before that life.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:10%
So it had a reason.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.217 align:middle line:10%
I never-- I didn't see that.

00:35:29.217 --> 00:35:30.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Was there something
for you to learn

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:10%
from the relationship with
this man during that lifetime?

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.142 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:35:35.142 --> 00:35:36.624 align:middle line:90%
>>[SIGHS] Wait.

00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:84%
He says it was so
difficult to do that.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>It was difficult?

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.260 align:middle line:10%
Do you know this man?

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.635 align:middle line:10%
Can you see him
in the afterlife?

00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:44.350 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah, I know him.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.862 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:35:45.862 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>I know who it is.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.389 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I know it.

00:35:50.389 --> 00:35:50.888 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:35:50.888 --> 00:35:51.387 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:51.387 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>>This time he didn't watch.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:10%
This time he saved me.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:10%
>>I understand.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.372 align:middle line:10%
>>[SNIFFS]

00:35:59.372 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Was this man your father?

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.929 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, we do a
couple of things.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:10%
First of all, we
help those clients

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:10%
awaken an understanding of
their immortal identities.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:10%
And then what we do is
we bring that integration

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:10%
back into their lives today.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
That spiritual integration
is really important.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
It's great to understand these
great things are within you.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But how, then, do we make
them real in your life today?

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.980 align:middle line:84%
If you can carry those
mindsets, shifts,

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:84%
that ultimate transformation
experience back into your life

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:84%
today, it not only
changes your life,

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
but the life of all of
those people around you.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.189 align:middle line:90%
And that's our gift to them.

00:36:39.189 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they can do
for those around them also.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:48.960 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>So from there, we
they typically go

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:84%
in front of a group
of wise beings.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.140 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
names for these beings.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Some call them the elders
or the wisdom makers

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
or all sorts of wonderful names
they give these wise beings

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.920 align:middle line:84%
who, in fact, are a step
or two above their guides.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:84%
These are non-incarnating
beings, OK?

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:84%
It's about as close to God
as we get, incidentally.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:84%
There is usually a very
interesting discourse

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that goes on.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
They ask questions, how did
you do in your last life?

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- they're
very gentle people.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>What happened
for me is my guide

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:84%
met me as soon as I
made my transition.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I was a Civil War scene.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I was in a pile of bodies,
not quite dead yet,

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:90%
along with a few others.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.385 align:middle line:84%
And finally leaving that
body, being met by my guide,

00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and pretty quickly being
taken to this sort of domed

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.437 align:middle line:84%
place that the council,
the wise beings,

00:37:49.437 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:84%
were and were going
to review with me.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this feeling,
that comes primarily

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:84%
for some religious
misunderstandings,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that as I approached this
building, that somehow I

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:90%
was going to be judged.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
sort of readers,

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
if you will, at the
doors to this place

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.810 align:middle line:84%
came forward and said, there's
no place for that here.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
This is not about being judged.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no place
for guilt or shame.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.650 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way
for you to enter here.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.250 align:middle line:90%
So I was reassured.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I think from a
Christian upbringing,

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.839 align:middle line:84%
there was this fear that
I was going to be judged.

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And they just said, that's
not what happens here.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went in, it was
these-- we talk about beings.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not really people.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.480 align:middle line:90%
You say, well, they had robes.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But I guess I
would describe them

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.780 align:middle line:90%
as energetic robes and beings.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just found love
again, unconditional love.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And as I stood before them,
they don't really-- well,

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
in my case, they didn't
really talk to me.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But what they did
was they took me

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:52.200 align:middle line:84%
through the experience
of a number of lifetimes.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was a review
of the past lives.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But not even watching a movie
or looking at it in a book.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:84%
They actually put me
into those lifetimes

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:06.042 align:middle line:84%
so I could re-experience them
from a different perspective.

00:39:06.042 --> 00:39:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me a
number of lifetimes.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:10%
One in particular
they took me through,

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:10%
where I was a slave owner.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:10%
And I had a group of
slaves, sort of in a trench,

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.510 align:middle line:10%
where I was whipping them.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.544 align:middle line:10%
And-- unpleasant.

00:39:23.544 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't judging me.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'm reviewing
this and watching.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It was horrifying
to see that I could

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:84%
have that sort of
attitude and mentality.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.924 align:middle line:84%
This is a soul lesson, something
I've carried for some time.

00:39:33.924 --> 00:39:35.840 align:middle line:84%
They said, you're doing
much better with that.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.682 align:middle line:84%
The work you're doing
is benefiting people.

00:39:37.682 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:84%
You're much less judgmental,
although you still

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.060 align:middle line:90%
have this tendency.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They said, but the
problem is, you

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
tend to direct that
toward yourself now.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So I've made progress, but
it's still something I carry.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more critical or
judgmental of self, right?

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they gave me a
really profound experience

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.800 align:middle line:90%
that I'll never forget.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And they took me
through the experience

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:84%
again of reconnecting with
the whole, of being part

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of the creator, part
of the universe.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And what a relief to be
reconnected in that way.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, when you
judge, when you criticize,

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:90%
when you discount, you separate.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what causes the
separation from the whole.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't talk to me
about it as a philosophy,

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.302 align:middle line:84%
but they gave me the experience
of being separated again.

00:40:28.302 --> 00:40:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think
that's something

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:90%
we all carry in our soul.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They gave me this experience,
and then they said,

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.452 align:middle line:84%
when you do this, you
diminish the light.

00:40:37.452 --> 00:40:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, whoa.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, we mean
you diminish the light

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:90%
as a whole when you do this.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
What a profound lesson
for me and for the world.

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Feel that
sensation of movement

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.185 align:middle line:84%
as you move on to
the next place.

00:40:57.185 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And tell me, what's
happening for you?

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.177 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:01.177 --> 00:41:03.372 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:41:03.372 --> 00:41:04.622 align:middle line:90%
What can you see ahead of you?

00:41:04.622 --> 00:41:07.454 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.454 --> 00:41:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[LAUGHS] It's like the
Milky Way in hundredfold.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.062 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:15.062 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.834 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'm a shooting star
shooting up. [LAUGHS]

00:41:19.834 --> 00:41:21.782 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:41:21.782 --> 00:41:23.371 align:middle line:84%
Continue on your
way, and let me know

00:41:23.371 --> 00:41:24.704 align:middle line:90%
when you reach your destination.

00:41:24.704 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Let me know what that is.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.456 align:middle line:84%
Ask your guide the lesson
from the life of Hans,

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:35.900 align:middle line:84%
now that you've
arrived home as Hans.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Ask him for the lesson in
that incident [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.029 align:middle line:90%
Hans' death.

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:41.025 align:middle line:90%
>>[EXHALES DEEPLY]

00:41:41.025 --> 00:41:45.515 align:middle line:84%
>>And report back to me what
that was in your own words.

00:41:45.515 --> 00:41:46.015 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:41:46.015 --> 00:41:50.006 align:middle line:90%


00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:50.506 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:41:50.506 --> 00:41:51.006 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:41:51.006 --> 00:41:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I was back stabbing people.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we must have had
a problem with the ship,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:04.731 align:middle line:90%
and we hardly had any food left.

00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:10.597 align:middle line:84%
And we had to have portions
of food, they gave us.

00:42:10.597 --> 00:42:11.551 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:13.936 align:middle line:90%
>>And I was not honest.

00:42:13.936 --> 00:42:18.996 align:middle line:90%
I was stealing from my comrades.

00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just cared about
myself to stay alive.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And others were [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to have all these
different experiences,

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
later is contained

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.760 align:middle line:90%
as a memory in your soul.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And then you just
simply-- when you

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:42.170 align:middle line:10%
are placed into your new
identity, into your task,

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:47.050 align:middle line:10%
and into a higher
evolved-- taking

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.150 align:middle line:10%
care of all these
different beings,

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:10%
then you start to realize
subconsciously you

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:10%
have all this memory stored.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:10%
Like I had to start as
Mousy, in a big way.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.780 align:middle line:10%
There was a huge storage.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.870 align:middle line:10%
We have tiny, tiny,
tiny little storages

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:10%
all over the place, which kind
of [INAUDIBLE] has all over.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:11.200 align:middle line:10%
And all these different
little cell memories,

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:10%
we carry with us from
all these memories

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.280 align:middle line:10%
in Earthly incarnations
and others.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.540 align:middle line:84%
They help us to be
more compassionate

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and to sense and feel
and open our hearts.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, if
we wouldn't have that,

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.070 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have that
resource, and we would judge.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.724 align:middle line:84%
So we bring these memories
back so we can learn?

00:43:36.724 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.860 align:middle line:10%
>>No, we bring
these memories back

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:10%
because we have them stored.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.570 align:middle line:10%
That's the difference.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:46.069 align:middle line:10%
>>OK.

00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:10%
>>It's so amazing.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:10%
I've never seen that.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.070 align:middle line:10%
It's like in your energy field
and even in your physical body,

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:10%
you have all that in
tiny little increments.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.930 align:middle line:10%
In little parts, you
have that stored.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.620 align:middle line:10%
And this is why you have
these huge facets of emotions

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.893 align:middle line:10%
and feelings, or else we would
be one or two dimensional.

00:44:08.893 --> 00:44:09.392 align:middle line:10%
>>OK.

00:44:09.392 --> 00:44:11.770 align:middle line:10%
I understand.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:10%
Are you ready to
release the fear

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.354 align:middle line:10%
of drowning that you hold
in the lifetime of Sophia?

00:44:18.354 --> 00:44:19.626 align:middle line:10%
>>[EXHALES DEEPLY]

00:44:19.626 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:10%
>>And I'd like you
to see, moving off

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.710 align:middle line:10%
into the distance in
threads which come from you,

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and move off into all those
lifetimes, where drowning

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.090 align:middle line:10%
has been an issue for you.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, it might contribute
to the building of that fear

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.230 align:middle line:10%
today, in the life of Sophia.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>What we really want
to do is somehow--

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and the oldest
souls we can talk to

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.090 align:middle line:84%
can't explain this--
we want to reach

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:48.790 align:middle line:84%
a level of self-perfection,
purity, that

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:52.180 align:middle line:84%
will allow us,
somehow, to get back

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to the source that gave us our
existence in the first place.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:90%
We long to return to that.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:00.570 align:middle line:90%
This is what drives all souls.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this is
what drives human beings,

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:90%
but we have forgotten it.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.177 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to bring
the religious term in there,

00:45:09.177 --> 00:45:10.510 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to get back to God.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm a young female, maybe 20.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.607 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>>How were you dressed?

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm wearing this very tight
corset dress, long, little

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.040 align:middle line:10%
slightly puffy below the waist.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:48.788 align:middle line:10%
A very-- with lots of lace.

00:45:48.788 --> 00:45:52.600 align:middle line:10%
>>And what is your
companion's name?

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.567 align:middle line:90%
>>Vlad.

00:45:53.567 --> 00:45:54.655 align:middle line:90%
>>Vlad?

00:45:54.655 --> 00:45:55.155 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hmm.

00:45:55.155 --> 00:45:58.286 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.286 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>And his last name, surname?

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Wallensky.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>And what year is it?

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>1863.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Help me understand this.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.210 align:middle line:84%
That all of you could
collectively share this.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:10%
>>All participants
collectively showed

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.640 align:middle line:10%
others about love, greed, hate.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Love others, about
love, greed, hate.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Love, strength, enduring,
enduring no matter what.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Survival, the worst
on a deeper level.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>You mean those in the camps?

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh, those in the camps.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But also those
that participated.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Those that
participated as well.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Those that
participated also were.

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It was like two-- there were
many polarities being played

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:58.120 align:middle line:84%
out, and all were a part
of that demonstration.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>So even the ones we
would call the perpetrators

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:02.376 align:middle line:90%
had a role in this.

00:47:02.376 --> 00:47:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>You know, from this side.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>From them, from your council.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:16.935 align:middle line:84%
>>From this side
of where I stand,

00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:25.080 align:middle line:84%
ah, it was much easier to be
the victim than the perpetrator

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
sounds really harsh.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>But it was much harder
because the pain of a soul,

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:84%
even though everyone agreed, the
pain of knowing that you could

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:58.094 align:middle line:84%
cause such suffering,
tear apart people,

00:47:58.094 --> 00:48:03.506 align:middle line:90%
was unbearable for many of them.

00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And standing up,
it's about courage.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>It seems to be a common theme.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we experienced
yesterday in the regression.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's someone who is in the
Holocaust and is a victim.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And as tragic and horrible as
that is, from that perspective,

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in spirit, from that expanded
state of consciousness,

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
felt compassion for
the perpetrators,

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:84%
for the pain that
their souls experienced

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.230 align:middle line:90%
in playing that role.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Not to make it right.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It is a terrible tragedy.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.050 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
sometimes things

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that we judge from
our human perspective

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.349 align:middle line:84%
as being right or wrong or
bad has a very central role.

00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:57.890 align:middle line:84%
This what they're
speaking to you of,

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.590 align:middle line:84%
or are they having you
experience this in some way?

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>They're talking to me, but
I'm also experiencing it.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.691 align:middle line:10%
They're showing me.

00:49:06.691 --> 00:49:07.190 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.990 align:middle line:10%


00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.116 align:middle line:10%
>>Help me understand
how this happens.

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:17.454 align:middle line:10%
>>As they're speaking
to me, it's going.

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:23.595 align:middle line:84%
I see all the events going
before me like a movie.

00:49:23.595 --> 00:49:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And then, I feel the fumes.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.790 align:middle line:90%
But I get the opportunity.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:31.772 align:middle line:84%
I'm so familiar with
what I felt in that body.

00:49:31.772 --> 00:49:33.563 align:middle line:84%
>>You know what you
felt in that body, yes.

00:49:33.563 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>But I'm seeing and feeling
what the perpetrators felt.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:46.537 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also seeing what others
that were victims were feeling.

00:49:46.537 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to put
the two side by side,

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.750 align:middle line:90%
it feels terrible.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:58.767 align:middle line:10%
But I'm glad I was on the side
of experience that I was on.

00:49:58.767 --> 00:50:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>>Research shows we consciously
choose our next life

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.520 align:middle line:10%
to gain spiritual growth
by overcoming adversity.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.730 align:middle line:10%
The adversity is agreed to
by all parties involved.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.280 align:middle line:10%
The actual severity may
change, but the lessons

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.870 align:middle line:10%
are generated by a
compassion to help

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.500 align:middle line:10%
another soul learn
from experience.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.080 align:middle line:10%
With the help of our soul
group and our spiritual elders,

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.030 align:middle line:10%
we choose a lifetime
where we believe

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.515 align:middle line:10%
we can gain or give
the most benefit.

00:50:28.515 --> 00:51:11.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things
that surprises people

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:19.290 align:middle line:84%
the most about their own
memories of being a soul

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is just how much
free will there is.

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Each soul chooses
their own lifetime.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a very careful
choice usually.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a very sacred
choice usually.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But each soul is given
more than one choice.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And the soul looks at these
choices of potential lifetimes

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.780 align:middle line:90%
on earth.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:84%
They also are able to scan
potential future timelines,

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.190 align:middle line:84%
because as we have realized
through the life between life

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:53.520 align:middle line:84%
work, there is
never one set path.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't incarnate with
a set beginning and a set

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.230 align:middle line:90%
end in mind.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.020 align:middle line:90%
There's no one future timeline.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, time seems to be more
like a tree with many branches.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:10%
And it's up to us as souls
to navigate those branches

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.340 align:middle line:10%
to the best of our ability,
to make our choices,

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.890 align:middle line:10%
and to live with those choices.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:19.052 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.052 --> 00:52:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>When they're ready
to come forward again

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.690 align:middle line:84%
in the next incarnation,
there's an area

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:27.030 align:middle line:84%
where there's kind of a life
selection, body selection

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:30.780 align:middle line:84%
area where they have choices
of different kinds of bodies

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and who they think they
could work best with.

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, their
elders and guides

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:41.060 align:middle line:84%
have had a hand in the selection
of choices, if you will.

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.145 align:middle line:84%
And then they come forward
into the next life.

00:52:43.145 --> 00:52:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's key to all
this is that there's such order

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:51.170 align:middle line:90%
and discipline upstairs.

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very compassionate
love relationship.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It isn't one that involves
the kinds of things

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that we see on Earth with
a hierarchy of beings who

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.510 align:middle line:84%
lorded over your
and engender fear.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.570 align:middle line:84%
There is so much forgiveness
and understanding.

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.010 align:middle line:90%
We all make mistakes.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of us make
terrible mistakes.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's all forgiven
once we cross over.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:21.990 align:middle line:10%
And there is various
ways in which

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:24.340 align:middle line:10%
they can help heal the soul that

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.880 align:middle line:10%
I explain in my books, but I
don't need to go into here.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:34.040 align:middle line:10%
But I just want you to know that
what clients gain from all this

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.340 align:middle line:10%
when they wake up in your
office after one of these long

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.220 align:middle line:10%
sessions is they just look
and they'll-- some of them are

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.040 align:middle line:10%
crying.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are laughing.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Some of them can't talk.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And generally, there's just
this wow, I can't believe it.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>So life selection is
taken very seriously.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We choose, often,
based on what we

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.630 align:middle line:84%
desire to learn
in an incarnation.

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So every now and
then, a soul will

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:84%
choose a lifetime for
rest and recreation.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
we choose a body

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:14.240 align:middle line:84%
for what that body will give
to us in terms of learning.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's often
a theme of service,

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.950 align:middle line:84%
where the soul might
choose a lifetime

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to serve humanity in some way
or to improve on their skills.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.190 align:middle line:84%
If a soul is very
interested in healing,

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.790 align:middle line:84%
it may choose a lifetime
with a broken body

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:84%
or with an illness
in mind in order

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:38.140 align:middle line:84%
to enhance its own healing
skills and knowledge.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Always, wisdom is
uppermost in mind.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We choose to incarnate
to harvest wisdom

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:50.210 align:middle line:84%
from the lifetime, to gain
direct experience and knowledge

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:53.080 align:middle line:84%
so that we are
improved as beings,

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.050 align:middle line:84%
so that we are
expanded as beings,

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:02.250 align:middle line:84%
so that we have more wisdom and
understanding and compassion.

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So souls choose the
lifetime very carefully.

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they prepare
for that lifetime.

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Very often, they have
meetings with the other souls

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.935 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to incarnate with.

00:55:13.935 --> 00:55:18.000 align:middle line:84%
They have meetings and
preparation with their guides,

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.790 align:middle line:84%
where they review all the
possibilities ahead of them.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And the real
intention is to make

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the most of every lifetime,
because lifetimes are treated

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:30.580 align:middle line:84%
as very precious,
sacred experiences.

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:37.970 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>I see the purple and blue
just streaming through me.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>And the outline of that
stream is golden light.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And it just streams right
through me out of nowhere.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Right through.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:05.575 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a stream of
energy that is washing away.

00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm embracing it
like I'm floating upward

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:17.585 align:middle line:84%
through that light,
like a waterfall.

00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like an infusion
and waterfall.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.888 align:middle line:90%


00:56:26.888 --> 00:56:29.520 align:middle line:90%
He's my guide.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.980 align:middle line:84%
He has a white
outline, as if he's

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.730 align:middle line:90%
like a white light that got out.

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:43.530 align:middle line:84%
A little round on top is if
there's a head with long hair.

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I can't see any details, it's
just blinding white light.

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:54.270 align:middle line:90%
So loving and inviting.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:56.050 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're
an emotional soul.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.660 align:middle line:90%
You like to worry.

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing
to worry about.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's like as if in the
blackness of the cosmos,

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.830 align:middle line:84%
with stars all over
the place, there's

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:16.290 align:middle line:84%
like a place with green
grass and a bench.

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And there we are sitting down.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is this place?

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
is where we decide

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.690 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to do
next, as if showing me

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:38.940 align:middle line:90%
where I could go next.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So from left to right, there
are different sceneries.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.230 align:middle line:90%
On the left, there is a city.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:51.800 align:middle line:84%
On the right, in
the middle, there's

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:57.202 align:middle line:84%
a mountain scene,
a Tibetan mountain.

00:57:57.202 --> 00:58:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Something snowy on top.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's another nature scene
a little to the right of that.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of snow, where
I don't want to go there.

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:19.550 align:middle line:84%
He says, choose your
environment first.

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:25.626 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll get a task
to do, what to do there.

00:58:25.626 --> 00:58:27.000 align:middle line:84%
He says, wait a
minute, I'm going

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.135 align:middle line:90%
to show you something else.

00:58:28.135 --> 00:58:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:36.120 align:middle line:84%
My fiance from my previous life,
he comes out in that uniform

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.330 align:middle line:90%
just so I recognize him.

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:42.150 align:middle line:84%
He takes that uniform
off and says, I

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.790 align:middle line:90%
don't need this disguise anymore

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:47.135 align:middle line:84%
>>Someone can read in
a book reincarnation.

00:58:47.135 --> 00:58:49.385 align:middle line:84%
And I could think, well
that's an interesting concept,

00:58:49.385 --> 00:58:51.690 align:middle line:90%
a theory.

00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Someone can have a
religious belief,

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:56.862 align:middle line:84%
I believe in reincarnation, or I
don't believe in reincarnation.

00:58:56.862 --> 00:58:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you take someone
through one of these sessions

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and they have the experience,
that's mind boggling for them.

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
something they see,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.800 align:middle line:84%
but a visceral experience
that they go through

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.110 align:middle line:90%
on a soul and body level.

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:12.750 align:middle line:84%
They come out of there
knowing that this is the case.

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.084 align:middle line:84%
It's far beyond a
concept or belief.

00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:16.038 align:middle line:90%
That's profound.

00:59:16.038 --> 00:59:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again, I've had
people go back to that time

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:30.470 align:middle line:84%
when Jesus was on the planet
and being connected somehow

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.820 align:middle line:84%
to that movement or that
group or that individual,

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing with
him or those close to him

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.480 align:middle line:90%
this deep sense of being loved.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.740 align:middle line:10%
And being so distraught
when he was killed.

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:48.156 align:middle line:10%
>>Falling, falling,
melting, relaxing.

00:59:48.156 --> 00:59:51.120 align:middle line:10%
Down, down, down.

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.590 align:middle line:10%
What part of the
world are you in?

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.933 align:middle line:10%
>>Jerusalem.

00:59:55.933 --> 01:00:00.370 align:middle line:10%
>>And what is the year
that you're experiencing?

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:01.555 align:middle line:10%
>>I see 18.

01:00:01.555 --> 01:00:02.980 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.410 align:middle line:10%
>>18?

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:06.135 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm aware of other people.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:09.783 align:middle line:10%
And I'm in front of them.

01:00:09.783 --> 01:00:11.700 align:middle line:10%
>>OK.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.250 align:middle line:10%
How old are you in this scene?

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.515 align:middle line:10%
What's the number that
pops into your mind.

01:00:15.515 --> 01:00:16.015 align:middle line:10%
Are you--

01:00:16.015 --> 01:00:16.670 align:middle line:10%
>>20.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.264 align:middle line:10%
>>20, OK.

01:00:18.264 --> 01:00:21.870 align:middle line:10%
Is this like the time
when Jesus is alive,

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.470 align:middle line:10%
or is this before or after that?

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:25.440 align:middle line:10%
>>Jesus is alive.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.020 align:middle line:10%
>>Jesus is alive?

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:27.800 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen Jesus
talk or preach?

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.870 align:middle line:10%
>>I feel mesmerized.

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:36.030 align:middle line:90%


01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:42.360 align:middle line:10%
I feel I can't-- I can't
believe I'm seeing.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%


01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a crowd just milling
about or some talking--

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.901 align:middle line:84%
>>They're just listening,
they're listening.

01:00:49.901 --> 01:00:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.020 align:middle line:84%
About how far away are you
from that person who's talking?

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Like 50 feet?

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>10 feet.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.936 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, 10 feet.

01:00:57.936 --> 01:01:00.216 align:middle line:90%
So quite close.

01:01:00.216 --> 01:01:01.590 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So how was the crowd
responding to him.

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:08.035 align:middle line:90%


01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:09.160 align:middle line:90%
What's the feeling you get?

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Quietly, patiently, seriously.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>So where is-- is this in
Jerusalem, or in a village

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:23.470 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else?

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:28.586 align:middle line:90%
>>It still feels like Jerusalem.

01:01:28.586 --> 01:01:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So just describe
what you're seeing.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>I do see the face of Jesus.

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.238 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:01:36.238 --> 01:01:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.716 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in this scene?

01:01:41.716 --> 01:01:45.890 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.992 align:middle line:90%
>>He's speaking.

01:01:47.992 --> 01:01:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.464 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm just mesmerized.

01:01:51.464 --> 01:01:54.940 align:middle line:90%


01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:58.337 align:middle line:10%
>>What is it about him
that mesmerizes you so?

01:01:58.337 --> 01:02:01.259 align:middle line:10%


01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.270 align:middle line:10%
>>His purity.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:05.140 align:middle line:10%
His honesty.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:09.880 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.576 align:middle line:90%
His heart, his truth.

01:02:13.576 --> 01:02:15.019 align:middle line:90%
>>Tell me about his face.

01:02:15.019 --> 01:02:16.943 align:middle line:90%
Describe it for me.

01:02:16.943 --> 01:02:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Beautiful.

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I almost can't breathe.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Now imagine that
I'm a blind person.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.114 align:middle line:84%
And I want to describe
his face for me.

01:02:26.114 --> 01:02:28.539 align:middle line:90%
What is the shape of the face?

01:02:28.539 --> 01:02:29.039 align:middle line:90%
>>Narrow.

01:02:29.039 --> 01:02:29.988 align:middle line:90%
>>Narrow.

01:02:29.988 --> 01:02:30.488 align:middle line:90%
>>Clean.

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:37.250 align:middle line:90%


01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>What about the--

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.606 align:middle line:90%
>>Soft.

01:02:39.606 --> 01:02:41.064 align:middle line:90%
>>Soft.

01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:43.008 align:middle line:90%
>>Intense.

01:02:43.008 --> 01:02:47.186 align:middle line:84%
>>What about his color
or his complexion?

01:02:47.186 --> 01:02:47.685 align:middle line:90%
>>Tan.

01:02:47.685 --> 01:02:48.184 align:middle line:90%
>>Tan.

01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%


01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:57.112 align:middle line:84%
Is it like olive skin or
ruddy skin or dark skin.

01:02:57.112 --> 01:02:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Tan.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:00.885 align:middle line:90%
Just tan.

01:03:00.885 --> 01:03:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
So his face is narrow and tan.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.634 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about his hair.

01:03:06.634 --> 01:03:09.800 align:middle line:90%


01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Simple.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Simple.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Long, simple.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.045 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it thick or thin?

01:03:16.045 --> 01:03:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Thin.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>What color is his hair?

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Light brown.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Light brown.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.170 align:middle line:90%
About how long is it?

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Shoulders.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Shoulder length.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.896 align:middle line:84%
Is it wavy or is it
straight and curly?

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:36.395 align:middle line:90%
>>Wavy.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:40.980 align:middle line:90%


01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.826 align:middle line:90%
What about his eyes, now.

01:03:42.826 --> 01:03:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Novice those eyes of his.

01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Brown.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.669 align:middle line:90%
>>Brown.

01:03:45.669 --> 01:03:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Like dark or light
or medium brown?

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Golden.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Golden brown.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.435 align:middle line:10%
What is he speaking of?

01:03:54.435 --> 01:03:54.935 align:middle line:10%
>>Love.

01:03:54.935 --> 01:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%


01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.360 align:middle line:10%
That you must love.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.825 align:middle line:90%


01:04:02.825 --> 01:04:04.540 align:middle line:10%
I just feel his kindness.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.228 align:middle line:90%


01:04:08.228 --> 01:04:13.208 align:middle line:10%
He showed us how to
live, how to love.

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:15.698 align:middle line:10%
>>How to love.

01:04:15.698 --> 01:04:19.682 align:middle line:10%
>>To be good, to be kind.

01:04:19.682 --> 01:04:22.670 align:middle line:10%


01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.610 align:middle line:10%
To be honest.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>>What happened to him?

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.721 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about him?

01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:28.663 align:middle line:90%
>>He died.

01:04:28.663 --> 01:04:29.605 align:middle line:90%
>>He died?

01:04:29.605 --> 01:04:31.350 align:middle line:10%
>>I couldn't see.

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.481 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't watch.

01:04:34.481 --> 01:04:36.913 align:middle line:10%
They beat him and tortured him.

01:04:36.913 --> 01:04:39.871 align:middle line:10%


01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:44.512 align:middle line:10%
>>And did you know
this was happening?

01:04:44.512 --> 01:04:46.867 align:middle line:10%
>>I couldn't.

01:04:46.867 --> 01:04:48.751 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't take it.

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:53.600 align:middle line:90%


01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.430 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm feeling drawn to a
church, that [? Frenchy ?] wants

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:03.144 align:middle line:10%
to bring me to a
big, gigantic church.

01:05:03.144 --> 01:05:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Cool, let's go.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>With ceilings of
like 100 feet high.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:14.365 align:middle line:84%
And gold statues, and the
pews are made of gold.

01:05:14.365 --> 01:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%


01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.245 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous
choir singing.

01:05:20.245 --> 01:05:23.382 align:middle line:90%


01:05:23.382 --> 01:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the two of
us, [? Frenchy ?] and me,

01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
sitting there and listening.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.366 align:middle line:90%
It's all for us.

01:05:29.366 --> 01:05:31.380 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is for us.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.104 align:middle line:90%
>>What is this place?

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:35.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of here?

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Why this experience?

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>He's just showing me.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Showing a beautiful place?

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, he says
you are [? York. ?]

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is your church.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
This is your church and your
synagogue and your temple.

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And you belong in this.

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I just want to show you that
all the spiritual things you're

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:middle line:90%
doing are right.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.292 align:middle line:90%
We built you this church.

01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You can call it church,
a synagogue, an ashram,

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.710 align:middle line:90%
But [? Yorks ?], it's yours.

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>>It's your holy place.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.470 align:middle line:10%
>>It's my holy place.

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
[? Frenchy's ?] just led me
to a place like a Taj Mahal.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.330 align:middle line:90%
And he says, come in.

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.050 align:middle line:90%
This is yours, too.

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:18.410 align:middle line:90%
That's yours and this is yours.

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:21.720 align:middle line:90%
You deserve it, you earned it.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
We're grateful.

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It's yours.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And she says, you can come
back here anytime you want.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.150 align:middle line:90%
They're never going to go away.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:37.340 align:middle line:90%
They're yours forever.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Someone asked me
just this morning

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
at breakfast what is
the purpose of all this?

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they
understand our purpose

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
for coming to Earth
in an Earth school.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But why does a creator
or group of creators

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
need to bother with creating
these imperfect souls who

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.002 align:middle line:84%
were striving for the perfection
that they already have?

01:07:03.002 --> 01:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of that?

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
If you were a
creator, if you were

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
a source of this
particular universe,

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.410 align:middle line:90%
why would you need to do this?

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I've asked a question a lot
with certain advanced clients.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got my own
feelings about it.

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And I could be completely wrong.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling is that the
creator or creators, if you

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
will, sources-- maybe they work
as a collective group-- create

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
souls in order to express
parts of themselves

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
that they want to see developed.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And when the perfection
is reached over millennia,

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
they will conjoin back with them
and make them stronger for it.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the best I
can come up with.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:08:00.050 align:middle line:90%


01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a big mission to
clarify and to create more,

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:20.609 align:middle line:84%
bring more, bring
more light and love.

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Clear, and cleansing,
and loving, and peaceful,

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
so eventually, when we're all
light, and know that we're all

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
light, all the other things
will go, sadness and such.

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Some people can feel the light.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Some people can see the light.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Noticing the light,
it creates more light.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.594 align:middle line:90%
You're part of light.

01:09:01.594 --> 01:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're
acting your natural way,

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
continuing your natural
mission, living the life

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:20.569 align:middle line:84%
is more helpful than trying
to change it or find something

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:22.130 align:middle line:90%
else.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:26.229 align:middle line:84%
It's that when I lose my
focus and my concentration,

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and I deviate from
the light, that's

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:32.025 align:middle line:90%
when it becomes difficult.

01:09:32.025 --> 01:09:35.162 align:middle line:90%


01:09:35.162 --> 01:09:40.569 align:middle line:10%
And he's saying that it really
doesn't matter in the end what

01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:49.970 align:middle line:10%
you do, you just have to do
what you choose with the light.

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:56.080 align:middle line:10%
>>For me, to know that you and
I are both of the same essence,

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.760 align:middle line:10%
it makes it much more
difficult for me to cause harm

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.664 align:middle line:10%
to you because it's
harming me and the whole.

01:10:02.664 --> 01:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
This experience I had
of diminishing the light

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and being separated
from is much more

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
difficult to repeat
knowing that.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's a message
for the entire planet.

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
How we cause harm to others.

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It's more difficult
to do that knowing

01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:21.798 align:middle line:90%
that we are all the same.

01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:27.686 align:middle line:90%


01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:30.940 align:middle line:10%
>>Tell me what this is like.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.830 align:middle line:10%
Help me understand
this experience.

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:33.823 align:middle line:10%
You're moving away.

01:10:33.823 --> 01:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%


01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Going home.

01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you still looking back
at-- are you looking ahead?

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Totally ahead.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.700 align:middle line:10%
Is there a sensation of
something propelling you?

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.112 align:middle line:10%
>>No, just getting
together with my friends.

01:10:52.112 --> 01:10:53.330 align:middle line:10%
>>They're here with you?

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>>Mm-hmm.

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.000 align:middle line:10%
>>Oh yeah, can you
tell me about that?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.935 align:middle line:10%
>>It's just lovely.

01:10:58.935 --> 01:11:01.675 align:middle line:10%
>>How many friends
are here around you?

01:11:01.675 --> 01:11:02.175 align:middle line:10%
>>Lots.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:02.675 align:middle line:10%
>>Lots.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.292 align:middle line:10%
>>Lots of friends.

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this like
too many to count?

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>I have about 20.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.405 align:middle line:90%
>>20?

01:11:10.405 --> 01:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
And what are they doing?

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Smiling.

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Smiling.

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Sort of embracing me.

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.730 align:middle line:10%
They're touching you, embracing.

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:20.155 align:middle line:10%
>>Oh, everybody's here.

01:11:20.155 --> 01:11:22.030 align:middle line:10%
>>Everybody.

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Everybody.

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.460 align:middle line:10%
How does that feel?

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.540 align:middle line:10%
>>Pretty good.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.378 align:middle line:10%
>>Ya, isn't it.

01:11:28.378 --> 01:11:33.420 align:middle line:10%
>>Do you recognize is there
somebody that's-- or maybe more

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.000 align:middle line:10%
than one there-- very familiar?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.826 align:middle line:10%
>>Ahh, my wife.

01:11:39.826 --> 01:11:42.124 align:middle line:10%
>>Your wife.

01:11:42.124 --> 01:11:43.540 align:middle line:10%
From then, the one
who was killed?

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.990 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, OK.

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:47.030 align:middle line:10%
>>My son.

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Your son.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a great
deal of planning

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:52.660 align:middle line:90%
that goes on before a lifetime.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You go through a
great deal of planning

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
with all of your
friends and loved

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
ones that are going to
get involved with you.

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
think seriously

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
about what kind
of body and brain,

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and what the tendencies of
that body are going to be,

01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and the brain that's either
very compatible with you or that

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.740 align:middle line:90%
might challenge you.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
These are all parameters
that we have to consider.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And also how much of
your energy, as a soul,

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.920 align:middle line:90%
you're going to invest.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.420 align:middle line:90%
We never put all of it in.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Part of us is always at home
in the spirit world, all of us.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.060 align:middle line:10%
We never-- a body, a
human body couldn't

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.110 align:middle line:10%
sustain all of our energy.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:32.702 align:middle line:90%


01:12:32.702 --> 01:12:36.396 align:middle line:10%
>>And he want to take
me to a healing center.

01:12:36.396 --> 01:12:37.872 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:12:37.872 --> 01:12:39.870 align:middle line:90%
How does he do that?

01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:41.485 align:middle line:90%
Does he take you by the hand?

01:12:41.485 --> 01:12:44.330 align:middle line:10%
>>Just glides me by the hand
and sort of-- I'm following,

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:45.570 align:middle line:10%
I know where to go.

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.860 align:middle line:10%
He's like, follow me,
and we go together.

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Now tell me what this
is like, this place.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:56.030 align:middle line:10%
>>This is like a place--

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:57.990 align:middle line:10%
>>Do you pass
anything on your way,

01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:59.240 align:middle line:10%
or maybe you're already there.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.470 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm already there, and
it's like an energy field

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:07.090 align:middle line:10%
that-- if you looked at it
from different perspectives

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:08.450 align:middle line:10%
you'd see it.

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:11.250 align:middle line:10%
There's multiple
lights, colored lights.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:14.390 align:middle line:10%
But depending what
work needs to be done,

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.550 align:middle line:10%
it is just you and your light.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's sort of like the way
I was sitting by the river.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:30.740 align:middle line:10%
The same kind of equipoise where
you draw energy from the room

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:34.420 align:middle line:10%
into the places where
it's been depleted.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:40.605 align:middle line:10%
>>You have to be rather
active in the process?

01:13:40.605 --> 01:13:41.260 align:middle line:10%
>>Mentally.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:45.170 align:middle line:10%
You have to pull it in, to
draw the energy towards you,

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:49.060 align:middle line:10%
to repair the places that
are missing or damaged.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.540 align:middle line:10%
>>How does that feel
as that's happening?

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:56.460 align:middle line:10%
>>Like filling up
with liquid water.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Liquid water.

01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:02.620 align:middle line:10%
>>But sort of a blissful water.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.889 align:middle line:84%
>>Liquid, blissful
water filling you, and--

01:14:05.889 --> 01:14:06.472 align:middle line:90%
>>Filling you.

01:14:06.472 --> 01:14:08.055 align:middle line:84%
>>--drawing out with
your own energy--

01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>And you pull it to the
places that need to be done.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:18.240 align:middle line:10%
There are so many places you
can go here, people you can see.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.516 align:middle line:10%
>>So they're not
just in one place?

01:14:20.516 --> 01:14:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>>No, they're everywhere.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>>Kind of strung about.

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, more
organized, but you can

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.410 align:middle line:10%
just-- there's so many
opportunities to stop and see

01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:36.590 align:middle line:10%
people and friends, and
people you've touched before.

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:38.870 align:middle line:10%
I see-- I can-- my core group.

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:42.530 align:middle line:10%
They're our teachers,
that's what it feels like.

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:45.230 align:middle line:10%
And there I can go visit
them in their classes.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:50.756 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'm in a classroom
with a friend, who's a teacher,

01:14:50.756 --> 01:14:55.013 align:middle line:10%
and they're introducing me.

01:14:55.013 --> 01:14:55.801 align:middle line:10%
>>Introducing you?

01:14:55.801 --> 01:14:56.300 align:middle line:10%
Is that--

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:59.435 align:middle line:10%
>>As somebody, a friend.

01:14:59.435 --> 01:15:00.395 align:middle line:10%
>>As a friend.

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.720 align:middle line:10%
So they don't know
you before this?

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.457 align:middle line:10%
>>My teacher friend does,
but the class doesn't.

01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:09.660 align:middle line:90%


01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>>So you're like
a guest speaker?

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.350 align:middle line:10%
What's this?

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:14.602 align:middle line:90%
>>Her name is Kashira, Kashira.

01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:15.435 align:middle line:90%
>>She's the teacher?

01:15:15.435 --> 01:15:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>>She's the teacher.

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:28.626 align:middle line:10%
She teaches a class in
energy construction.

01:15:28.626 --> 01:15:31.045 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you know something
about energy construction?

01:15:31.045 --> 01:15:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that why--

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>She says I do.

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, you're not so sure.

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.880 align:middle line:90%


01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Energy construction.

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
aligning energy,

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
aligning the milk of the
universe into geometric shapes.

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:59.692 align:middle line:90%


01:15:59.692 --> 01:16:01.800 align:middle line:10%
>>And is there a
purpose for those?

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:07.568 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, they retain
energy, they retain--

01:16:07.568 --> 01:16:10.820 align:middle line:10%
they retain everything,
the stuff of the universe.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:16.400 align:middle line:10%
So memories, dreams,
reflections, attitudes,

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.414 align:middle line:10%
happiness, joy ahh--

01:16:20.414 --> 01:16:21.580 align:middle line:10%
>>What about physical stuff?

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Are they about that too
or is that different?

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.720 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, it's composed
of physical stuff

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.710 align:middle line:10%
but it's mostly kind
of retaining emotions.

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:34.032 align:middle line:10%
And because emotion is energy.

01:16:34.032 --> 01:16:40.100 align:middle line:10%
So when you have a intention it
goes into this geometric shape

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.270 align:middle line:10%
and stays there.

01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:44.160 align:middle line:10%
And you can-- if you
create it properly--

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.770 align:middle line:10%
you can make it so
that it'll stay there.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:49.792 align:middle line:10%
But also that you're
retaining-- so let's

01:16:49.792 --> 01:16:51.250 align:middle line:10%
say you're in the
classroom and you

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:55.590 align:middle line:10%
create this energy--
Let's say you

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:58.190 align:middle line:10%
put your good intention or
some kind of an intention

01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:02.060 align:middle line:10%
together into this geometric
shape and you bring it to life.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And you create it so
that it stays with you.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you're able to
carry that into your life

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.340 align:middle line:90%
so you have access to it.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it's
important to bring it along

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.230 align:middle line:10%
with you because
how else are you

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:21.920 align:middle line:10%
going to retain all of
your past experiences

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.430 align:middle line:10%
unless you have
these energy fields.

01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:27.526 align:middle line:90%
I see.

01:17:27.526 --> 01:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is something
you make for yourself.

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.361 align:middle line:90%


01:17:33.361 --> 01:17:33.860 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.410 align:middle line:10%
>>Not so much that you
make use for others.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:40.360 align:middle line:10%
You're making this for
you in preparation?

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.436 align:middle line:84%
>>The actual thing that you're
creating in the classroom

01:17:45.436 --> 01:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
are almost like
emotional ball bearings.

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>That's the geometrical part?

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
They do have different
shapes, and only

01:17:55.210 --> 01:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because the nature of
the way it's designed.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a geometric shape,
but that's how it functions.

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But think of it
as a ball bearing.

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
ball bearings work,

01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:15.470 align:middle line:84%
where they help everything
else move fluidly.

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So you carry these
ball bearings with you

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.436 align:middle line:90%
through your incarnations.

01:18:20.436 --> 01:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%


01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you go along,
unfortunately, they

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
pick up negative
stuff sometimes.

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.420 align:middle line:10%
And that causes disruption
in the ball bearings.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.580 align:middle line:10%
So you have to-- when
you come back here-- you

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.389 align:middle line:10%
work on cleaning that
stuff' up and fixing it.

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:43.430 align:middle line:10%
>>Make new ball bearings.

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:47.640 align:middle line:10%
>>Make new ball bearings,
restructure them.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.150 align:middle line:10%
Like taking them into the shop.

01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:50.867 align:middle line:84%
>>Physics explains
to us-- and they've

01:18:50.867 --> 01:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
been trying to explain
to us, I think,

01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:55.020 align:middle line:84%
for 40 years,
quantum physicists--

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that everything we think is
physical and solid, in fact,

01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.850 align:middle line:90%
is just pure energy.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Everything that you
create is an energy form.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.850 align:middle line:10%
If you create positive
energy things,

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:14.180 align:middle line:10%
forms, then you're putting
out positive love and energy

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.940 align:middle line:10%
into the universe.

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:23.840 align:middle line:10%
It's a way of keeping that
light going, expanding it.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.600 align:middle line:10%
>>You said at first that it's--
that you really are in healing

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.060 align:middle line:10%
as well, and so is that what--

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:33.870 align:middle line:10%
>>I think healing is that-- this
is my odd way of doing it is

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.900 align:middle line:10%
like you can heal through
words because-- of course,

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.780 align:middle line:10%
we know you can
heal through action,

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:47.500 align:middle line:10%
but the idea of healing
through words and thoughts,

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:52.380 align:middle line:10%
and putting those into pictures
and film because those are all

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.640 align:middle line:10%
images of--

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.960 align:middle line:10%
>>Just another way to
deliver the energy.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>The same energy.

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>What are you involved with?

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>It's healing.

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:05.070 align:middle line:10%
It's energy transfer
in-- oh, I'm

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:19.500 align:middle line:10%
trying to do it with
voice, art, music, film.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.090 align:middle line:10%
I think it came from a
classroom environment, yes, yes,

01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:27.020 align:middle line:10%
where we were talking
about coming back

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:30.410 align:middle line:10%
and what was the
method that you could

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:35.530 align:middle line:10%
use to help people
with energy transfer.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:41.460 align:middle line:10%
And so it might be a little
bit out of the box or unusual.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.000 align:middle line:10%
I see.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.560 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of like I'm
learning, or trying

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:53.853 align:middle line:10%
to teach how to transfer energy
through emotion, through words,

01:20:53.853 --> 01:20:56.906 align:middle line:10%
through language, through--

01:20:56.906 --> 01:20:57.405 align:middle line:10%
>>Art?

01:20:57.405 --> 01:20:57.904 align:middle line:90%
>>Art.

01:20:57.904 --> 01:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you
create is an energy form.

01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:05.860 align:middle line:10%
If you create positive
energy things,

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:11.240 align:middle line:10%
forms, then you're putting
out love and energy

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.284 align:middle line:10%
into the universe.

01:21:13.284 --> 01:21:19.575 align:middle line:10%
It's a way of keeping
that light going.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:20.200 align:middle line:10%
>>You said it--

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.010 align:middle line:10%
>>Expanding it.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:24.314 align:middle line:10%
>>--at first, that you
are in healing as well.

01:21:24.314 --> 01:21:26.210 align:middle line:10%
And is that what it--

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:29.328 align:middle line:10%
>>I think healing is that
with-- this is my odd way of--

01:21:29.328 --> 01:21:30.156 align:middle line:10%
>>Of doing it.

01:21:30.156 --> 01:21:30.822 align:middle line:10%
>>--of doing it.

01:21:30.822 --> 01:21:34.950 align:middle line:10%
You can heal through
words because-- of course,

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:37.760 align:middle line:10%
we know you can
heal through action,

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:44.550 align:middle line:10%
but the idea of healing
through words and thoughts,

01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:48.450 align:middle line:10%
and putting those in
the pictures, and film,

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:50.330 align:middle line:10%
because those are
all images of--

01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:53.007 align:middle line:10%
>>It's just another way
to deliver the energy.

01:21:53.007 --> 01:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>--the same energy.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.750 align:middle line:90%


01:21:56.750 --> 01:22:02.370 align:middle line:10%
End result is out there,
and it will work out

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:08.160 align:middle line:10%
as I imagined it had I planned
it and intricately manipulated

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.110 align:middle line:10%
it.

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:12.970 align:middle line:10%
And everyone's on the same ride.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.550 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's going
to work out just fine.

01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>The question could
be asked, I suppose,

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.580 align:middle line:84%
why is it that this information
hasn't been available

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.346 align:middle line:90%
earlier in our history.

01:22:23.346 --> 01:22:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a couple
of reasons for that.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.470 align:middle line:90%
I've thought a lot about it.

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we've never
been so overpopulated

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
Earth's societies,

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and we are like rats
in the maze really.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.970 align:middle line:84%
There are so many of us
running in so many directions.

01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I think,
it's a pervasive use

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.150 align:middle line:84%
of drugs, which has even
reached our elementary schools.

01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:48.040 align:middle line:10%
And when someone is
taking drugs in order

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:51.100 align:middle line:10%
to quote "escape from reality,"
which so many tell you

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.860 align:middle line:10%
that that's how
they got started,

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.540 align:middle line:10%
it shuts down the soul.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.960 align:middle line:10%
And maybe the powers that be
upstairs have decided it's time

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:02.440 align:middle line:10%
to loosen up this amnesiac block
a little bit that we all have

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.730 align:middle line:10%
when we come into this world.

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're now able to
receive and gain information

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps earlier was
not really available.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:21.946 align:middle line:90%


01:23:21.946 --> 01:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>The people who
come to our institute

01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to learn the
techniques that we have

01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to teach with regard
to life between lives

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
under deep hypnosis are
looking to gain a new insight

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:41.610 align:middle line:84%
as to the purpose of
our existence here.

01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here, where am I going?

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.940 align:middle line:84%
These age-old questions
are now being answered,

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I think in many ways,
through the kind of hypnosis

01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
that we use to reach
into the inner mind.

01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>People just want to explore.

01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who they
are, really who they are,

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:07.470 align:middle line:90%
and why they're in this world.

01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the world
wants-- there's nobody,

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I think, on this planet that
doesn't want to know that.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>It keeps coming back
to the same thing.

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.700 align:middle line:90%
It's within.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not out there in
some person, or prophet,

01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:18.600 align:middle line:90%
or anyone else.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And what a huge
reframe it is for them.

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.890 align:middle line:84%
After spending a lifetime
in relationships saying,

01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.240 align:middle line:84%
how disappointing,
what's missing?

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.840 align:middle line:84%
To being told, not by a priest,
or a minister, or a rabbi,

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or a psychic or a
reader, but through

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
their own inner
experience in one

01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
of the sessions that that
energy still is in existence,

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.880 align:middle line:90%
and that they carry it.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
It's available to them and that
they can offer it to others.

01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:47.754 align:middle line:84%
>>Look, I think
traditional belief systems

01:24:47.754 --> 01:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
are starting to break
down all over the world.

01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:51.586 align:middle line:84%
I think people are looking
for something more.

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I think they're looking
for a greater understanding

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of themselves
rather perhaps being

01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:59.230 align:middle line:84%
told by other people
what to believe.

01:24:59.230 --> 01:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can look at
what you have within,

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's got
to be the real stuff

01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:04.610 align:middle line:90%
because it's your own.

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you can tap into that,
if you can have access to that,

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.154 align:middle line:90%
it's very, very empowering.

01:25:09.154 --> 01:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We all know that the
world is picking up pace.

01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
If we can have something
that's incredibly centering,

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
like a wakening,
an understanding

01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:19.240 align:middle line:84%
of your immortal identity,
that just seems to be the most

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.900 align:middle line:84%
centering and focusing part
of you you could ever have.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.580 align:middle line:10%
The more people who discover
that beautiful compassion

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.340 align:middle line:10%
and wisdom that we
hold within, that's

01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.590 align:middle line:10%
got to be good for the planet.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%


01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.780 align:middle line:10%
>>Ponder from moment if
reincarnation exists,

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.140 align:middle line:10%
doesn't it make sense
to keep the planet clean

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:44.600 align:middle line:10%
so we can return to it?

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.150 align:middle line:10%
If we choose our lives,
and choose our parents,

01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:50.290 align:middle line:10%
then the question is why did
we choose this particular life?

01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:54.430 align:middle line:90%


01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:57.230 align:middle line:10%
If our destiny is crafted
and helped by our own higher

01:25:57.230 --> 01:26:00.670 align:middle line:10%
selves, is it possible we put
stones in our path on purpose?

01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.330 align:middle line:10%


01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:05.830 align:middle line:10%
If there is no death,
then and why can't we

01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:06.935 align:middle line:10%
begin to enjoy life?

01:26:06.935 --> 01:26:10.140 align:middle line:90%


01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.190 align:middle line:10%
Over 7,000 people told Michael
Newton and his trainees

01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:17.870 align:middle line:10%
the same things about the
afterlife under deep hypnosis.

01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:19.840 align:middle line:10%
If what they are
recounting is true,

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.360 align:middle line:10%
the spirit world is obviously
trying to tell us something.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.900 align:middle line:10%
A shift in consciousness
is upon us.

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:36.430 align:middle line:90%


01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:38.650 align:middle line:10%
If highly realized
Tibetan Lamas can

01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:40.680 align:middle line:10%
dictate their next
reincarnation,

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.680 align:middle line:10%
is it possible that
we all do the same?

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:50.550 align:middle line:90%


01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Part of the Boddhisattva
vow is to promise

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:55.040 align:middle line:10%
to return to the
planet until everyone

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.510 align:middle line:10%
is liberated from suffering.

01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:03.530 align:middle line:90%


01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:05.810 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible it's
a vow that we've all

01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:07.370 align:middle line:10%
taken without our knowing it?

01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:16.623 align:middle line:90%


01:27:16.623 --> 01:27:20.580 align:middle line:10%
The research shows we all are
interconnected, spiritually and

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:23.546 align:middle line:10%
energetically, with out higher
selves and with the earth.

01:27:23.546 --> 01:27:32.590 align:middle line:90%


01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Billions of souls, some
being born, never dying,

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.550 align:middle line:10%
reincarnating where
and when we choose.

01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:49.366 align:middle line:90%


01:27:49.366 --> 01:27:53.000 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps it's time to reframe
our vision of our soul's journey

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.450 align:middle line:10%
as well as protect the earth
for our return trips here.

01:27:56.450 --> 01:28:05.850 align:middle line:90%


01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:07.900 align:middle line:10%
See you on the Flipside.

01:28:07.900 --> 01:30:29.634 align:middle line:90%
