00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So for me, I'm afraid of--

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:90%
he just showed me.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It's my past life
stuff that is causing

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
me to be afraid of the ocean.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:90%
That's funny in and of itself.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But he's taking me down
to the right of the bow.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the right, but it's below.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It's on the bottom,
in the front.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And there's a hole.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.552 align:middle line:90%
There's a hole in the front.

00:07:57.552 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he showed
me an explosion.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe one of
the explosions--

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know, but
he showed me an explosion

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
that caused that part--

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.169 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.926 align:middle line:90%
it's in the front.

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's in the front,
what he showed me.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's where the--

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:90%
supposedly, there was a fire.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's possible.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But they hit the iceberg
on the right side, and--

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know that.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I have no--

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm just--

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
but we're mostly about
connecting to Billy.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted him to
show that to you,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.648 align:middle line:10%
and what his experience
was like doing that.

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> He's making fun of
me decompressing now.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:90%
My whole face is like--

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.644 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:90%
that's interesting.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have some
mutual friends.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.805 align:middle line:90%
We have John and Lori.

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I met Billy in a pub in London.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And he was dating his
girlfriend Louise.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
He told me about her, and he
was doing that movie "Aliens."

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.652 align:middle line:84%
And he laughed really loudly,
and I went, oh my god.

00:09:01.652 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You're the guy who was
in "Weird Science."

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, have you had a chance
to see John Hughes since you

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:90%
got home, or is he--

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> He says he's really busy.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Helping people out?

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You can always be
connected to us, but we--

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.965 align:middle line:84%
but you guys are
really-- this is what--

00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:19.295 align:middle line:90%
he's saying, don't be confused.

00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
He just went like
this to my head.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Stop that.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not very nice.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, hold on.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Will and I were going to make
a movie together in 1986.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And now this is our
chance, finally,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:90%
to make a film together.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
important for you

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to tell messages
to your friends,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
because I will get
these messages.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:90%
So Jim Cameron.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Anything to Jim?

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.242 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
He says thank you.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything specific that you
could give me that only Jim

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
would know is coming from
you, as opposed to me?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:90%

Where what is?

>> "I know where it is."

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, the thing that Jim--

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they still
looking for that--

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Not the Titanic.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:90%
They know where that is.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Not the Titanic,
but the jewelry.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I think that's made up.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.798 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's real.

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
But you know where it is?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, where is it, buddy?

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that's going
to give more specifics.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.515 align:middle line:10%
Where is it?

00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:10%
Is that what he's
showing you, a jewel?

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:10%

so I can listen to him.

as I'm looking here.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
He showed me you.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
He's like, I'm trying to talk.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
He goes--

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I apologize.

>> Hold on.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:10%
There's something that happened
in February, it feels like.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
deals with a deal.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.667 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's not a divorce
or anything, but something

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:90%
that deals--

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
something that happened
in February that's

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:90%
going to go through in June.

>> Jim Cameron.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Something's going to
go through for Jim.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.067 align:middle line:84%
>> And it might be in movies,
or something that was either

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
discussed or talked
about or done.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.065 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be--

00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Happening in June?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And is that something--

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Something maybe
they're filming in June.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that something you were
going to be involved with?

>> I don't know.

00:11:24.838 --> 00:11:26.255 align:middle line:84%
He's showing me
looking at papers,

00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:28.811 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think he was
going to be in the film.

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, well, it's--

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:90%
well, whatever.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Here's the bottom line.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line
is I think people

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%
are more tuning into this
stuff than we think they are.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to reach out
to Jim, you know how to do it.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:90%
You know how to talk to him.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.211 align:middle line:84%
You know how to
whisper in his ear.

00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't want to scare him.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, scare him.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Do.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I did not.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:90%
That's so interesting.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm glad he did,
because we are going to get

00:11:51.938 --> 00:11:52.738 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:54.173 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to say his name.

00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, all right.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's just talk about
some more interesting stuff.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned you
get around faster.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:90%
You can fly.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:90%
So what is that to Jennifer?

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Show her what it is for you to
fly from one place to the next.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> He's showing me before
I can even process,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
going to all the
corners really fast.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he's showing me in
slow time how many things are

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
going fast in the interim, but
yet he's even faster than that.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
He slowed down to
show that he's--

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean almost like tag?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Like 5,000 tags.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And what you saw was
like four or five,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and then when you slow
it down super slow,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:90%
you see like each tag.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> He knows I'm hungry.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.495 align:middle line:90%
>> What did--

00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.144 align:middle line:90%

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> He showed me the aerial
view of being above us.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Not in a hierarchy way,
but he showed me your head.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And that works best is the
eyes, the windows to the soul.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what he sees.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, would you
rather have just touching?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:90%
He was like, I wish.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.698 align:middle line:90%
It was just like--

00:13:25.698 --> 00:13:26.990 align:middle line:90%
he showed me touching the hand.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So, well, Bill, if you
were going to pick some part

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
of your life to re-experience
again, what would it be?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Other than meeting me
in that bar in London.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> He just showed me a
gun, chewing tobacco.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah?

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Horses.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Chewing tobacco?

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:90%
You like to chew tobacco?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>> No, he doesn't.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
But he's showing me--

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you could have.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --the way.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just like--

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you could have.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:10%
You're like an old cow hand.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:10%
>> A sheriff.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:90%
He's showing me being a sheriff.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> A sheriff?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And where was that?

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Texas.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Texas.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And where in Texas?

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And Australia.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And Australia.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Where else?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.035 align:middle line:90%
Where in Texas?

00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Austin?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Or was it Australia?

00:14:02.135 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Austin?

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Near Austin?

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Cool.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Outside of Austin.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:10%
It's northeast of Austin.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Northeast of Austin.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:10%
>> And a big ranch.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And what were
you doing there?

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:10%
What year was this, roughly?

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.076 align:middle line:10%
>> It feels like
the Civil War, 18--

00:14:19.076 --> 00:14:19.876 align:middle line:10%
or maybe after.

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:21.352 align:middle line:10%
1879?

00:14:21.352 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So Bill, are there any of
your old girlfriends I need

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:90%
to reach out to?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.506 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:30.675 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] I don't
have any old girlfriends.

00:14:30.675 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I only had eyes for my wife.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:90%
That was a test.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:90%
You answered.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.802 align:middle line:84%
So why did you have an apartment
in LA and a house in Ojai?

00:14:40.802 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Airport.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Close to the airport.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very cool.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.245 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere close to
the airport, huh?

00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>> He's laughing.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I reached out to
you two weeks before you passed

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying to figure
out how I could get a job

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
on "Training Day."

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I reached
out to David Ayer,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
who's a friend of mine, the
guy who wrote the original one.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, oh, I'll call
Bill and schmooze my way

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:90%
into a gig.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Never would have
happened, I know.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.985 align:middle line:90%
>> You could've.

00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:14.933 align:middle line:90%
He says it could've.

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't tell me that.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] Anyways, well,
here we are working on a movie

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, what can we ask
that an average person would

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
want to know about you?

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what your day is like.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:90%
What's it like--

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds weird.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I know there's not
a day or a time.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:90%
But, like, do you sleep?

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.912 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a house
where you hang out?

00:15:38.912 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no sleeping there.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No sleeping, OK.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a house or a
place and you hang out?

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:90%
>> On a white beach, yeah.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And is that-- do you go
there for relaxation,

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
or is that like--

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
He goes there to think.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.827 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think about
while you're on the flip side?

00:15:56.827 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> About how he wants
his next life to be.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's fascinating.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> How he wants the world to
be a better place, you know?

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Then how could
you help affect that?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> He just showed me Elon
Musk getting something made

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.416 align:middle line:90%
for the earth.

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I guess we're in trouble still.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Not maybe now,
but it's coming.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, if we keep it up this way.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> He does say that
I'm hungry, though.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Says that you're hungry.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Please eat.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Bill, can we just-- we'll
table this, and then--

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.725 align:middle line:84%
Before we leave you alone
in your ether world--

00:16:43.725 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> He's like that
annoying voice.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> --on your white beach.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Are you fishing on
your white beach?

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing there?

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Are you drinking whiskey?

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Better.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Way better.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Way better.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> He just showed me like
a tidal wave of what.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Tidal wave of what?

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.295 align:middle line:90%
>> That it's like a--

00:17:03.295 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
it really does come down
to math and science,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that he put an equation
together that will

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.656 align:middle line:84%
get the right taste of whatever
it is that you're looking for.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
saying is is when you

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
want to experience something
like a white beach,

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.080 align:middle line:90%
it's a mathematical equation.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.769 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.254 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to
take it to that extent.

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:90%
So when he-- thank you.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.945 align:middle line:84%
So remember in the beginning
of this conversation,

00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:90%
how you liked to go--

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.237 align:middle line:84%
you want to figure out the
travel velocity, and the speed,

00:17:35.237 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.173 align:middle line:90%
You guys have a calling.

00:17:38.173 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you're over there
playing on the other side,

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.798 align:middle line:84%
you want to go to
the other places,

00:17:41.798 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're interested
on how that happens.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, how does it happen?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Describe it like if--

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Bill, if you wanted to move and
suddenly be in, I don't know,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Rome or Paris--

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> He just showed
me, like, flying off.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Just getting into the matrix,
it takes you right there.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Takes you right there.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So is it that you--

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Instantly.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you shift your
energy mentally,

00:18:05.237 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:90%
and then you appear there?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> He almost pulled there.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So more like magnets
going across the table.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.465 align:middle line:90%
It is like magnets.

00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:17.965 align:middle line:84%
It just automatically takes you
where you're supposed to go.

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:10%
And you don't question it.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Don't question--
not to think about it.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.822 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't question it.

00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:10%
So it's like, we get in our
head, and we think about it.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.235 align:middle line:10%
Should we go?

00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:10%
Should we not go?

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:90%
And you just are open to it.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> For them, you just go,
because you're pulled to it.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.013 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody
needs you, they'll

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:36.096 align:middle line:84%
feel that, which is that
frequency, that telephone

00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:36.896 align:middle line:90%
ringing.

00:18:36.896 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.642 align:middle line:90%
Am I saying that right?

00:18:40.642 --> 00:18:41.442 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:41.442 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So let me ask you this.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Since you're sort
of outside of time,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.858 align:middle line:84%
we could be having
this conversation here,

00:18:48.858 --> 00:18:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and you could also be
having a conversation

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
with somebody else like Louise,
or your son, or our friend

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Lori, and sort of
tapping them on the head,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
let's say, at the
same moment you're

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:90%
tapping Jennifer on the head.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.940 align:middle line:90%
So is that--

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> He said the shoulder.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Or on the shoulder.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a question
Jim, about Jim Cameron.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Jim said that he had
a vision of the--

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:10%
>> "Avatar."

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Avatar," of
the blue creatures,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
or he had a dream when he
was like in high school.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:90%
What was he seeing?

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Are those actual-- are there
people on another planet?

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Was that what--

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>> He's laughing.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
He goes, they were martians.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:10%
He showed me Africa.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Did his dad to go
to Africa by chance?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There was something
with an African influence.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.167 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean for Jim
Cameron, or for Bill?

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> For Jim Cameron.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:90%
For Jim Cameron.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we ask that an
average person would want

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:90%
to know about you?

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what your day is like.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
What's it like--

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know the sounds weird.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.075 align:middle line:84%
I know there's not
a day or a time.

00:19:54.075 --> 00:19:55.075 align:middle line:90%
But, like, do you sleep?

00:19:55.075 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a house
where you hang out?

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no sleeping there.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>> No sleeping.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:10%
Do you have a house or a
place that you hang out?

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:10%
>> On a white beach, yeah.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.995 align:middle line:10%
And is that-- do you go there
for relaxation, or is that,

00:20:10.995 --> 00:20:11.795 align:middle line:10%
like--

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:12.642 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:20:12.642 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:90%
He goes there to think.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.577 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think about
while you're on the flip side?

00:20:17.577 --> 00:20:20.844 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:23.205 align:middle line:84%
>> About how he wants
his next life to be.

00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Class, we're here.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:90%
We're in session.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.535 align:middle line:84%
And now, Lu, we're going
to let you moderate this.

00:20:30.535 --> 00:20:33.086 align:middle line:10%
>> She just said, we
love it back here.

00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.160 align:middle line:10%
This is a little bit quieter.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:10%
So Lu, we want you to help
us moderate this discussion.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So now, one of your--

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>> She already was.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You already were.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But one of your
students named Bill

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
has raised his hand
politely and said

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:90%
he wants to share something.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Would you call on Bill and ask
what does he want to share?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it a picture of Jack?

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god, that was so funny.

00:20:56.863 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
He's like, pick me,
pick me, like the desk.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Like, pick me!

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.937 align:middle line:90%
He was so funny.

00:21:01.937 --> 00:21:03.145 align:middle line:90%
He just pushed the desk away.

00:21:03.145 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So Bill, what do
you want to say?

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, because he
did show me the article.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.022 align:middle line:10%
What did I get wrong?

00:21:15.022 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything but nothing.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.322 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, very good.

00:21:19.322 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Everything but nothing.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Speak.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.485 align:middle line:90%
Don't edit.

00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:30.285 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:21:30.285 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> He said-- he goes, you didn't
get anything right because you

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:33.782 align:middle line:90%
downplayed it.

00:21:33.782 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.908 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:35.908 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't need the credit.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.225 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:21:39.225 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold on.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.124 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.124 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He goes, did you
talk about his buddy?

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Donald.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:90%
The guy that--

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I didn't mention him.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:10%
The Irish guy.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Irish name.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> The guy that I read?

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you this, Bill.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So the last time
we spoke, you were

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
precision of creating

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:90%
a mathematical sequence.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:90%
So you're on a white beach.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
You said it was a
mathematical equation.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're also doing
that here, aren't we?

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.383 align:middle line:84%
These are all the props are
all mathematical equations

00:22:15.383 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:90%
that we are perceiving here.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why we've been seeing
Einstein so many times, yes.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So that idea of the object
that we think of holding

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.765 align:middle line:84%
the coffee is literally
atoms agreeing to--

00:22:27.765 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Collectively, yes.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.795 align:middle line:84%
>> --collectively take that
spot, and the coffee in there,

00:22:31.795 --> 00:22:32.795 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah, right?

00:22:32.795 --> 00:22:33.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Blah, blah, blah.

00:22:33.628 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Blah, blah, blah.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Which accounts for
pizza and cappuccino.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.057 align:middle line:90%
>> It was interesting.

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:42.935 align:middle line:84%
He's like, allow the
process, however--

00:22:42.935 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] He's showing
me you talking to me,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.856 align:middle line:90%
saying, don't judge it.

00:22:51.856 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It's actually so-- it's
like sleep, sleep, right?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Dreaming.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So they show me, like, don't
judge it, blah, blah, blah.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They have-- by
making it more wrong,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like more of a documentary.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:23:07.592 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not asking
people to believe in it.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's-- I mean, I was
thinking about this earlier.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
That should be the
title of the book.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.715 align:middle line:84%
It's not our job to make
you believe anything.

00:23:17.715 --> 00:23:18.568 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:18.568 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
That could be a subtitle of it.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the book is called.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
You notice I didn't--

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Billy, which one?

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
He wants his name
above the title?

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.815 align:middle line:90%
"Bill Paxton Speaks."

00:23:28.815 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:90%
That's not a bad title.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's fine.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:90%
We'll discuss that.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So how is this
research that would--

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Unearthly answers.

00:23:38.676 --> 00:23:39.476 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:23:39.476 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are these
unearthly answers

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.835 align:middle line:90%
going to help our planet?

00:23:45.835 --> 00:23:46.635 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:23:46.635 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing is
that, even with friction,

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:90%
it raises the vibration.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.150 align:middle line:84%
They show me the vibration being
raised, the consciousness--

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.395 align:middle line:90%
So the reason--

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And eventually, if
there's enough people--

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
because the skeptics that are
going to want to come in have

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
the view of being a
skeptic in this recording,

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:90%
like you have been--

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:09.895 --> 00:24:13.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks [CHUCKLING]
for making me the person.

00:24:13.946 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Then more people can talk to
more people on the other side,

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
believe they can.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've never
confirmed this.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How is talking to people on
the other side going to help

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:90%
people here?

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.386 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.386 --> 00:24:37.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they'll understand
that they have help from

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:38.735 align:middle line:90%
the other side.

00:24:38.735 --> 00:24:39.535 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:39.535 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And why do they need
to understand that?

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.296 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.296 --> 00:24:50.654 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can start believing
in what they're being given.

00:24:50.654 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:90%
If they can start--

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Believing in what
they're being given.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Of our classmates, Julian
Barratt had said to me,

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.925 align:middle line:84%
I don't particularly want to
know what's going to happen.

00:25:00.925 --> 00:25:01.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:01.725 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
This isn't telling them
what's going to happen.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.347 align:middle line:90%
It's telling them how--

00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> To process what is happening.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.388 align:middle line:90%
>> How to coexist and detach.

00:25:09.388 --> 00:25:10.305 align:middle line:90%
They showed me Buddha.

00:25:10.305 --> 00:25:11.105 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:11.105 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But how to process what
really is happening.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And that would be inclusive of--

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
that your attachment to
things is a waste of time.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Non-reality.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.077 align:middle line:84%
>> But things that
aren't of the heart.

00:25:24.077 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:90%
That things are not about-- so--

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.416 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just props.

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Just the stage.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's important to be able
to say that you stay attached

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to the things of the
heart, is that correct,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and not just detach
yourself from everything.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Because people get
confused with that.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If you love drugs, it's
not a good attachment.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You just detach
yourself from that.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:90%
But no, but--

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's an addiction.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:46.767 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But people do this thing of,
they see this Buddhism is about

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
non-attachment.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And while they try to
practice non-attachment,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
they detach themselves
from their mother,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:84%
from their father,
from their children.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And they go off
and live in a cave.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And the point is not
to go live in a cave.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:90%
You're here for a reason.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But hold on to the attachment
to the stuff that's real.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And the vanity, the vanum
populatum, let that all go.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.015 align:middle line:84%
Is that correct, or should I
not talk Latin to you guys?

00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> He just brought in a whole--

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.025 align:middle line:90%
yes, that is correct.

00:26:21.025 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Love is a higher frequency.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:90%
So if it's too--

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.786 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So love is a
higher frequency.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I hear that.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.455 align:middle line:90%
Love is a higher frequency.

00:26:31.455 --> 00:26:32.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:32.255 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're going to make
a wish that you want to come

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.998 align:middle line:90%
true, attach love to it.

00:26:38.998 --> 00:26:40.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:40.462 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Let love be the vehicle
to ride this thought,

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:90%
this prayer into the universe.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't attach it, but feel it.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.786 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, if
love's a higher frequency,

00:26:55.786 --> 00:26:58.837 align:middle line:84%
if tuning into love,
tuning into love

00:26:58.837 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:84%
allows you to have
greater reactions--

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.823 align:middle line:84%
>> They're trying to
get away of terminology.

00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're going
to have to explain it,

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:84%
but getting away from
ter-- because it's quicker

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.562 align:middle line:90%
to just condition it.

00:27:08.562 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I understand.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just saying--

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:90%
I get this asked a lot.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Like, how do I--

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:90%
so the answer is--

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.580 align:middle line:84%
you can ask for assistance,
is what he's saying.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.762 align:middle line:84%
Because then they'll
start getting pictures

00:27:23.762 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:90%
that come into your mind.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.935 align:middle line:84%
And then you can dive
in further with that.

00:27:26.935 --> 00:27:30.962 align:middle line:84%
>> And allow whoever the
icon to be is the icon.

00:27:30.962 --> 00:27:31.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:31.762 --> 00:27:32.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoever that might be.

00:27:32.804 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's
Jesus the gardener,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:90%
or if it's the Avatar.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Or Buddha.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, Billy Paxton
wanted to say something.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Billy.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, I have
something for Billy.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.395 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't worry
about-- he's like,

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:84%
tell Rich don't worry about
how to get this work--

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:84%
because we're kind
of done right now--

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:90%
these books out.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's interested in it.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
He says not to worry
about getting it--

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:90%
however to get it out, or.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, everybody's
interested in it.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.440 align:middle line:90%
I think as long as-- whatever.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I think we're on the
right path, which

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.383 align:middle line:84%
is, we're not claiming
we're talking to anybody.

00:28:20.383 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:90%
But we knew these people.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:90%
We know who they are.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And they verified who they are.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can come up
with a logical reason

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.572 align:middle line:84%
of how they can verify who
they are with neither one of us

00:28:31.572 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
knowing what it is
they're talking about,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and then finding
out to be accurate.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:90%
To a T.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I was revisiting the
Harry Dean tape yesterday,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.115 align:middle line:84%
going through what
Harry Dean had

00:28:43.115 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to say about this whole--
everything he had to say

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:90%
was so right on the money.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.284 align:middle line:90%
>> It's awesome.

00:28:50.284 --> 00:28:51.208 align:middle line:90%
I win!

00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I said, I win.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES] You win.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, I
think some of your pals

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.425 align:middle line:84%
have opened up their
mind a little bit.

00:29:01.425 --> 00:29:02.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:02.225 --> 00:29:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know how much, or--

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.795 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's why they
won't take my calls.

00:29:06.795 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I think a lot of them are--

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
like they showed me, they
had opened up their--

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:84%
so you showed me we're
opening up our minds,

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and how everybody that's
here, how we're the only two

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:90%
that are doing this.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to get other
people's awareness that are

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.368 align:middle line:84%
not-- that don't
believe in this,

00:29:28.368 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
it's like trying to blow out a
candle that's never going to--

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.618 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it doesn't want
to blow out, yeah.

00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> --that won't go out at all.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a waste of energy.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he said, does it take
a lot more time to get through

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:90%
to somebody that is cut off?

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:90%
They said, no, it's impossible.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:46.775 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:90%
How about you, Billy?

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Anything you want
to talk about, or--

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it makes me
feel better when they do.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> When they do?

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%
When they do what?

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:10%
>> When they open up.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:10%
>> When they open
up, like Harry said.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it was such a waste
of time, a waste of energy.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
If he had just allowed
himself to have believed

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in the possibility, it
would have saved him

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:90%
all that time and effort.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all laughing
over that one still.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:90%
They're all laughing.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.370 align:middle line:90%
And Billy want to say something?

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Please, Billy.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.288 align:middle line:90%
Come on forward.

00:30:21.288 --> 00:30:22.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to say, buddy?

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Get over it.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.653 align:middle line:90%
Reach out to her, he says.

00:30:27.653 --> 00:30:29.942 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES] OK, no.

00:30:29.942 --> 00:30:30.900 align:middle line:10%
I tell you what, Billy.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I know.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Give me something to say that
she would know comes from you

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:10%
and not me.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.977 align:middle line:84%
Tell her that he came in a dream
to her a couple nights ago.

00:30:51.977 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Couple nights ago.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.872 align:middle line:84%
And that he's trying
to get through to her.

00:31:01.872 --> 00:31:04.205 align:middle line:84%
There's changes that she's
really confused about making.

00:31:04.205 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he was always there
for her, so there's changes--

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it was college.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.258 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:09.258 --> 00:31:09.686 align:middle line:90%
Kids.

00:31:09.686 --> 00:31:10.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:31:10.114 --> 00:31:10.914 align:middle line:90%
Decisions.

00:31:10.914 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Decisions that are being made
that are very tough, he says.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell her that he's in con--
like, if she asks questions,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:90%
tell her he's there helping her.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So listen.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Listen.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:10%
And so can I tell her
what Michael Lutin told

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:10%
us, which is, just
ask the questions,

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:10%
and when they're
answered before you

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:10%
can come up with an
answer, that means

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.636 align:middle line:10%
you're connected to spirit?

00:31:36.636 --> 00:31:40.524 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, without
mentioning Michael Lutin.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES]

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:43.750 align:middle line:10%
>> No, I won't.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:10%
No, no.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.473 align:middle line:10%
>> But yes.

00:31:45.473 --> 00:31:46.360 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:10%
>> That's-- OK.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And you think this is
OK for me to reach out

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:90%
to her on Instagram?

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever it takes.

00:31:55.495 --> 00:31:56.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Gee, thanks.

00:31:56.295 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's important, he says.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the greatest way to
find out if he's even talk--

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.085 align:middle line:84%
I know you gave us names
and every-- he just

00:32:04.085 --> 00:32:06.580 align:middle line:84%
showed me William again, like
how you're able to document.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.825 align:middle line:90%
Listen, I understand.

00:32:08.825 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Look, Bill, I'll do my best, OK?

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:90%
What can I say?

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:10%
I want you-- if you can,
Bill, when she reads something

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.990 align:middle line:10%
that I wrote, I'll have
to do it in like three

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:10%
different Instagram posts.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:10%
I think I'll probably start
with, I knew your dad.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I hope you're OK.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
one will be--

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
should I have her
contact Jennifer?

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Because I can--

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:84%
He says the wants the
whole family together,

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
when they're all
on the same page.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:90%
So think about it, Billy.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending her a message that
says, hi, I knew your dad,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and I had a dream--

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:90%
can I say this?

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:10%
I had a dream about
him the other night

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.507 align:middle line:10%
where he told me
he was trying to--

00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:56.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Perfect, he says.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> --he was trying
to reach out to you.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:59.045 align:middle line:90%
>> And that--

00:32:59.045 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> In his dream.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:90%
In her dream.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>> In her dream, and that
he wants you to know that

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:10%
he's helping you.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.780 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.720 align:middle line:90%
He's there for you.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell her that she doesn't
have to worry about what she

00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:84%
has to do, or what she's
going to be doing in June.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Dude.

00:33:22.555 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Dude, it's too specific.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] That's
what I do for a living.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.284 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, but it's
scary specific, OK?

00:33:29.284 --> 00:33:31.774 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:31.774 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.415 align:middle line:10%
Can you bring my
friend Bill forward?

00:33:55.415 --> 00:33:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> He said Bill has
been waiting for you.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Bill, what do you want to
say to your family and friends?

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:13.898 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.898 --> 00:34:15.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Was he unable to say
goodbye before he passed?

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
quick, or no closure.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No closure.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So we can give them
closure, buddy,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.310 align:middle line:84%
because you know
I know your wife.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't met your
kids, but we were friends,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.039 align:middle line:84%
and what would you
like to say to them?

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:33.895 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.895 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That's it, that
I have closure.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.117 align:middle line:90%
I am at peace.

00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:84%
He knows that he didn't
get to say goodbye.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:90%
There's no closure.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It feels like they still have
that wound because there was

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.620 align:middle line:90%
no closure before he passed.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Or he must not have been
able to say goodbye.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
He keeps going like
this, which means,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.355 align:middle line:84%
didn't get to say
goodbye before I passed.

00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:59.792 align:middle line:84%
>> But what does he
look like to you?

00:34:59.792 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually don't
see him at all.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
He just makes me do
that with my hand.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.675 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:05.925 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel a sensation or
a presence surrounding you?

00:35:05.925 --> 00:35:06.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:08.235 align:middle line:90%
Did he have heart issues?

00:35:08.235 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Chest?

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:84%
All the energy goes into
the heart and the chest

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.972 align:middle line:90%
to validate his presence.

00:35:12.972 --> 00:35:15.305 align:middle line:84%
And he makes me feel like his
passing was quick, like he

00:35:15.305 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:90%
didn't get to say goodbye.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But he's at peace with
the quickness of it,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and I have closure with that.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And I want them to have closure.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:90%
They need to have closure.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So Billy, the only way we
can get them closure is for you

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:90%
to tell them something--

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Who?

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --that they don't know the
answer to, or we don't know

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:90%
the answer.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.225 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you could
tell that's new information?

00:35:37.225 --> 00:35:41.342 align:middle line:84%
>> All I heard when you
were talking was, I'm sorry.

00:35:41.342 --> 00:35:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that sorry to
me, or sorry to them?

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I think it's to them.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
apologize to me, too.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:90%
It's OK!

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.475 align:middle line:84%
Now that this door
is open, we can

00:35:52.475 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:90%
have conversations with them.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.333 align:middle line:90%
We can help them!

00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:57.868 align:middle line:90%
Because, you know, come on.

00:35:57.868 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
You and I talked about
being in a movie together,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:90%
and now's your chance.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm directing you in a movie.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Was he on medication, or was
there something with medicine?

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.620 align:middle line:90%
You can maybe ask his family.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he was
getting an operation,

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:16.052 align:middle line:84%
and they were fixing his
heart, and then he died.

00:36:16.052 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something-- he's
showing me a pill bottle,

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and that's my
symbol for somehow--

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so were they
giving him out--

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> --medicine.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what, they could
have had you on heart medicine.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but it's
more than that.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Medicine was involved somehow
with his health or his passing.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> But here's my thing.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:90%
You've passed all that.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:90%
You're back home.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Are you there with
your soul group?

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Are there people there that
were there to greet you?

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.576 align:middle line:84%
Who greeted you when
you checked out?

00:36:44.576 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm comfortable.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Would you know if
his dad was there--

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.070 align:middle line:84%
if his dad was
passed before he did?

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, his dad
had passed away.

00:36:50.445 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I see "dad"
written in the air, so--

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Last time that
I saw you, dude,

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I invited you to a screening
of one of my films.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:04.460 align:middle line:10%
And I heard you in the audience,
but I didn't talk to you.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.962 align:middle line:10%
So how'd you like that film?

00:37:07.962 --> 00:37:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> This is what I hear.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.990 align:middle line:10%
When you said, but I
didn't talk to you,

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:10%
he says, but I talked to you.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] Yes, we
talked on the phone prior

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:90%
to the screening.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But then, dude, you
were at the screening.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- I haven't
talked to you since!

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.115 align:middle line:84%
>> When you said, how did you
like the film, I asked him,

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, can you comment on it?

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:90%
How'd you like the film?

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.130 align:middle line:84%
It's either he feels
so much like you,

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.745 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to do something
similar, or did similar work,

00:37:34.745 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:90%
or he felt like it was him.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, you were jealous!

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:10%
He was jealous.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Like, it seems like--

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Competitive.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.550 align:middle line:10%
>> He sees himself in it.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, very good.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:10%
>> He sees--

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:43.206 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:37:43.206 --> 00:37:44.248 align:middle line:90%
He could have been in it.

00:37:44.248 --> 00:37:46.023 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:37:46.023 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> He feels like he's
represented by it,

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:48.490 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
He feels connected to it
like it represents him.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.040 align:middle line:90%
He feels that close--

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --to his life.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's true.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.650 align:middle line:84%
We did spend some time
together in that place.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, Billy, I just
wanted to tell you,

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:10%
I want to leave this
door open for you.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was
interviewing Kim today,

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, this would
be a fun chance to just say hi,

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:08.525 align:middle line:84%
and you can come
through whenever

00:38:08.525 --> 00:38:11.149 align:middle line:90%
you need to, if you need to.

00:38:11.149 --> 00:38:16.643 align:middle line:84%
>> He says-- he feels like
he would be a smart alec.

00:38:16.643 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> He was.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> He says, well, you always
have the chance to say hi.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't need her.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's saying.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, no, I know that.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I just want to--

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.003 align:middle line:90%
>> He's just being a smart alec.

00:38:27.003 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I just wanted to
publicly acknowledge us

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.870 align:middle line:90%
as a conversation so that--

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
I'll see your wife.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I think I got to go up
the state to see her.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But we have a mutual friend Lori
that might be talking to you.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Rocky.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.995 align:middle line:84%
Might be talking to
Rocky, people like that.

00:38:44.995 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just saying.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
If I can help you in
some way, don't hesitate

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:90%
to stop by and check it out.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, aren't you a
little impressed

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.555 align:middle line:90%
to be introduced by Jesus?

00:38:55.555 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.030 align:middle line:10%
>> He's a smart alec.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.057 align:middle line:10%
He's like razzing you.

00:39:02.057 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:10%
>> What does he say?

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.283 align:middle line:10%
>> He says--

00:39:04.283 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES]

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.870 align:middle line:84%
He's like, well, what
are you talking about?

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:10.770 align:middle line:90%
We go way back.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Like when you talk about,
aren't you impressed,

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.893 align:middle line:84%
he's like, what are
you talking about?

00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:14.790 align:middle line:90%
We go way back.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.490 align:middle line:10%
And then he's kind of
like, where are you?

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.120 align:middle line:10%
But he's just kind
of beating you up.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:10%
You know how, I guess--

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
That was our relationship.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at us sitting here

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.780 align:middle line:84%
at Hugo's Restaurant in West
Hollywood, what do you see?

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.470 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Like it's about time--

00:39:32.423 --> 00:39:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've been
hesitant to talk to him,

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.298 align:middle line:84%
or open up, or something,
but he's like--

00:39:36.298 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's about time.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.905 align:middle line:90%
>> He keeps going like this.

00:39:38.905 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good, Billy.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, listen, I called
you, you didn't call me.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.320 align:middle line:10%
What can I say?

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.595 align:middle line:10%
I'm still waiting
to hear from you.

00:39:46.595 --> 00:39:48.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Did he smoke?

00:39:48.105 --> 00:39:49.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:39:49.265 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Because he's like--

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I hadn't seen him in about
20 years, something like that.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.090 align:middle line:90%
10, 15-- 15 years.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> He's got like a--

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.165 align:middle line:84%
it must be a cigar, because it
feels bigger than a cigarette.

00:40:02.165 --> 00:40:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a sweetheart.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Listen, he's very missed.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.950 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people loved him.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Funny guy.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> He's very-- he is.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:84%
He feels like he
knows no stranger,

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:90%
like that kind of person.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.305 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was the biggest thing
you learned in passing over?

00:40:19.305 --> 00:40:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES]

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.510 align:middle line:10%
There is no time.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:10%
There is no death, he says.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:10%
And he didn't realize how much
fear he had until he died.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Until he came here.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.917 align:middle line:90%
Until I came here, he says.

00:40:32.917 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You had spent a lot of
time worried about your heart,

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:35.490 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no fear.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.280 align:middle line:10%
There's no time.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.150 align:middle line:10%
>> But everybody-- are you aware
of all of these tributes that

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.950 align:middle line:10%
are happening?

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:42.783 align:middle line:10%
Let me ask you this.

00:40:42.783 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:10%
Have you had your
past life review yet?

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.408 align:middle line:10%
Has that happened?

00:40:46.408 --> 00:40:47.256 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hm.

00:40:47.256 --> 00:40:49.415 align:middle line:10%
He makes it seem like
that was a long time ago.

00:40:49.415 --> 00:40:50.215 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:40:50.215 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:10%
Oh.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, all right.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.850 align:middle line:10%
And any highlights you want
to share, or low-lights?

00:40:55.850 --> 00:41:00.272 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you were surprised
to see, or were happy about,

00:41:00.272 --> 00:41:01.072 align:middle line:90%
or?

00:41:01.072 --> 00:41:01.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:01.872 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting perspective.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.486 align:middle line:90%
He says that he realizes--

00:41:08.486 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:84%
says that-- I'll
just say verbatim.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I'll speak as if I'm him.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'll say this.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:10%
I realized the fear that
I carried within myself

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.960 align:middle line:10%
planted fear in others.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.830 align:middle line:10%
And for that, I shed
remorse, meaning,

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.870 align:middle line:10%
like, I know and
acknowledge my remorse,

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:10%
and I have to heal in that way.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:32.933 align:middle line:10%
Because he's showing the
collateral damage he did.

00:41:32.933 --> 00:41:35.475 align:middle line:10%

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:84%
The flour has to-- like
everything makes up

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.890 align:middle line:90%
the frequency.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.910 align:middle line:90%
So all the matrix happens--

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.590 align:middle line:90%
it happens all at once.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's just say the idea--

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And he can see that.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.510 align:middle line:90%
He can see what's happening by--

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:90%
wait.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.162 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

00:48:28.162 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I was like, is it your
needs or our needs?

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it your need to talk
to this person, or is it--

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:36.885 align:middle line:84%
for the first
time, I didn't know

00:48:36.885 --> 00:48:38.685 align:middle line:84%
the-- it wasn't
something consciously

00:48:38.685 --> 00:48:39.780 align:middle line:90%
that I know the answer.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.920 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, wait a second.

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it you creating all
this for your own answers,

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:45.330 align:middle line:90%
or is it us creating the need?

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter?

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:50.040 align:middle line:90%
No, I guess it doesn't, does it?

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, on some--

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> But it has to--

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.350 align:middle line:90%
like a battery being placed.

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.343 align:middle line:90%
It has to be able to fire.

00:48:57.343 --> 00:48:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Has to be in place.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It has to be in place.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But for example, somebody
hearing a song on the radio--

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.400 align:middle line:90%
or the "Twister" thing.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's a guy
watching "Twister."

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:08.872 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it was on--

00:49:08.872 --> 00:49:10.655 align:middle line:84%
>> He made him stop
the channel to there.

00:49:10.655 --> 00:49:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> To there.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.950 align:middle line:90%
He puts his awareness.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So when he's trying
to figure things out,

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.050 align:middle line:84%
he puts everything
he can into that.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And so for example,
so I'm talking to Kim,

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:25.795 align:middle line:84%
and Kim's father is going to
call right as we're having this

00:49:25.795 --> 00:49:26.595 align:middle line:90%
conversation--

00:49:26.595 --> 00:49:27.678 align:middle line:90%
>> He just went like this.

00:49:27.678 --> 00:49:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --but he hasn't called.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Right, so he's talented at that.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But so you put the
thought in his mind

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to watch the movie "Twister"
like, oh, that'll be cool,

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.690 align:middle line:84%
knowing that, in a few
minutes, she's going to call.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.387 align:middle line:84%
She had a need for
some type of affir--

00:49:44.387 --> 00:49:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Affirma-- ah, she needed, OK.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was the end-all.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's my question.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.180 align:middle line:90%
So because time is a c--

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> She had a need.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the negative and
positive, he showed me.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It's both sides of the--

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but also, that idea,
since we're outside of time,

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the ability to manipulate events
from where you are is easier

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.390 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So where are my
lottery tickets?

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] You
asked for a dollar.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.215 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES] Dude.

00:50:13.215 --> 00:50:14.015 align:middle line:90%
All right, so--

00:50:14.015 --> 00:50:16.777 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, Rich asked for
the numbers for the lottery,

00:50:16.777 --> 00:50:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I gave him the numbers,
and he won a dollar.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] And then
when I won the dollar,

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.064 align:middle line:84%
I heard a voice in my head say,
not very specific, were ya?

00:50:25.064 --> 00:50:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:32.530 align:middle line:10%
So you reaching out to them
necessarily isn't for you.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:90%
It's for them to be more open.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.400 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean,
people over there?

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.205 align:middle line:90%
>> People over here.

00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> His wife is--

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:41.342 align:middle line:90%
OK, reaching out to that, yeah.

00:50:41.342 --> 00:50:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So that conversation is
going to make it to where

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.207 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
question it, right?

00:50:47.207 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Good, bad, or indifferent.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But then they're not
going to let it go.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:54.452 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's important.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not for you, he says.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not for me.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.950 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:59.385 align:middle line:90%
It's all about me, Bill.

00:50:59.385 --> 00:51:00.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Always.

00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:01.923 align:middle line:90%
>> It may seem to be about you.

00:51:01.923 --> 00:51:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Just because you're on
the flip side doesn't--

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> He just showed me me.

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.940 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yes!

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:06.937 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:51:06.937 --> 00:51:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Just because you're on the
flip side doesn't make you

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:84%
still more important, even
though you're much more famous

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:13.680 align:middle line:90%
than I'll ever be.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I just laughed.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I did love
you in "Titanic."

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.460 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I know.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he was
really good in that.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.590 align:middle line:84%
He was pretty cute
in that, wasn't he?

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> He was cute.

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.210 align:middle line:84%
He's not saying
it's going to work,

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's going get him
thinking, his son thinking.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Tell him he talked
to someone like me.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to be
necessarily me, but tell

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.528 align:middle line:84%
him that you talked to
somebody that actually works--

00:51:33.528 --> 00:51:35.050 align:middle line:90%
give him, like-- whatever.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So Bill, any last words that
you want to have for us,

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.150 align:middle line:84%
or anything you want to pass
along beside your wisdom and--

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> He said thank you.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, dude, thank you, man.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Look, we're--

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:48.092 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't believe
in this stuff.

00:51:48.092 --> 00:51:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> We're having more conver--

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> He did.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:90%
He's like, doo-doo-doo-doo.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:52.590 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.302 align:middle line:84%
>> We're having more lovely
conversations now than we did

00:51:55.302 --> 00:51:56.510 align:middle line:90%
while you were on the planet.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a frequency.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Dude, cool.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.190 align:middle line:90%
And he says yours is strong.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, listen.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.163 align:middle line:84%
If there's any way I can
help you and your family,

00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:05.960 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Might be difficult at first.

00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they're
going to respond,

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.952 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to make
them think, he says.

00:52:10.952 --> 00:52:12.330 align:middle line:90%
It's going to make them open up.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:12.930 align:middle line:90%
They're hurting.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and I'm sure they are.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Be your weird self.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm just
going to be myself.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Like I care.

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.550 align:middle line:84%
If people believe me or
not, it doesn't matter.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.926 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to help.

00:52:24.926 --> 00:52:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> He loves you.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you too, dude.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Peace out.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:32.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, Miss Raylene.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.850 align:middle line:10%
How are you doing?

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm doing fantastic, Elisa.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.560 align:middle line:10%
How about yourself?

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.590 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm doing excellent.

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.210 align:middle line:10%
And I guess our boy is there.

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Erik, I love you so much.

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> He is here.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:44.610 align:middle line:90%
He says, hello, mama.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:45.920 align:middle line:10%
I love you very much too.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.720 align:middle line:10%
He's excited.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:51.040 align:middle line:10%
>> And so we're going to bring
in a good buddy of my friend

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.740 align:middle line:10%
Rich Martini, a filmmaker,
Bill Paxton, the movie star.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.930 align:middle line:10%
He was on "Twister"
and some other things.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Great guy.

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:02.748 align:middle line:10%
Died way too young.

00:53:02.748 --> 00:53:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Erik, can you go get him?

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>> He's here already, and Bill
says that was one of many.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.270 align:middle line:84%
He says, the movie that I really
enjoyed creating was "Titanic."

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.915 align:middle line:84%
He says, that was
one of my favorites.

00:53:14.915 --> 00:53:15.715 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:53:15.715 --> 00:53:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you were on that?

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:17.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:17.713 --> 00:53:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, I had no idea.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> He says it was awful hard.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, wow.

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.330 align:middle line:10%
What was your favorite
other than that?

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:27.070 align:middle line:10%


00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:10%
>> "Twister."

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I loved it.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Cow!

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Another cow!

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:32.140 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.958 align:middle line:90%
That was awesome.

00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:36.250 align:middle line:84%
All right, so do you mind if
we ask you some questions?

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got Richard's
questions, but I'm also

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.170 align:middle line:84%
going to ask you
some questions that

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.972 align:middle line:84%
have some spiritual value that
might be learning opportunities

00:53:43.972 --> 00:53:45.784 align:middle line:90%
for the viewers.

00:53:45.784 --> 00:53:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> He's ready for this, and he
says thank you for giving him

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.990 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
get his voice across.

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, certainly.

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.665 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any messages
for your buddy Rich?

00:53:53.665 --> 00:53:56.390 align:middle line:90%


00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's sitting
down, and he says,

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Rich was more than
a buddy to me.

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:04.340 align:middle line:84%
He was a really close
friend who I loved dearly.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.220 align:middle line:84%
He says, my departure has
been extremely hard for him,

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.645 align:middle line:84%
and it has been extremely
hard for my family.

00:54:09.645 --> 00:54:11.020 align:middle line:84%
He says, I want
everybody to know

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.250 align:middle line:90%
that I am happy and healthy.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:19.280 align:middle line:84%
He showed me that his heart is
the reason why he passed over.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I had heart complications
with an operation,

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't expect to die,
and nobody expected me to die.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.480 align:middle line:10%
So this was very
sudden for people--

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:10%
my family members to take on.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.810 align:middle line:10%
He's telling Rich to be patient.

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:37.710 align:middle line:10%
He says, because there's going
to be big changes for him

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:43.082 align:middle line:10%
this coming year in regards
to his filmmaking industry.

00:54:43.082 --> 00:54:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Will he ever get involved
in any of the stuff related

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.940 align:middle line:90%
to Channeling Erik?

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.460 align:middle line:90%
He said he is going to.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:84%
His work right now is
going to be mainly focused

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:58.232 align:middle line:84%
on spirituality, or almost
investigating the afterlife.

00:54:58.232 --> 00:54:59.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what he's
going to be doing.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:84%
He does good when he puts things
all together, and very much

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:08.840 align:middle line:84%
like a poster
board or a collage.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is how he can figure
out what his next step is.

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like a
vision board, maybe.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.160 align:middle line:90%
So here's one of his questions.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.638 align:middle line:84%
Who was there to greet you
when you crossed over, Bill?

00:55:20.638 --> 00:55:24.060 align:middle line:90%


00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a smart ass.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.825 align:middle line:90%
He said God.

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, of course.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> He's being a smart
ass, is what he's doing.

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.810 align:middle line:84%
He says, I had family members
that were there to greet me.

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:38.480 align:middle line:84%
My first family member
was a grandmother,

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and she was connected to his
mother's side of the family.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:43.780 align:middle line:84%
This has helped
him to transition.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.720 align:middle line:84%
He says his transition was
really shocking for him,

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.870 align:middle line:84%
because he wasn't
expecting to pass away.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So as he crossed
over, it was a shock.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:57.080 align:middle line:84%
He didn't realize
that I was dead.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else meet you around the
same time as your grandmother?

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.420 align:middle line:84%
He's also showing
me a gentleman.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.158 align:middle line:84%
And he has the
gentleman here with him.

00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:10.950 align:middle line:84%
He's connected to
father, so this is either

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.020 align:middle line:84%
his father or someone
on his father's side.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Probably his father.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>> He says father.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:17.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:21.763 align:middle line:90%


00:56:21.763 --> 00:56:24.390 align:middle line:10%
What was the cause of you
crossing over specifically?

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So a heart complication when you
were having some surgery, or?

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:30.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I haven't read anything
about you, sorry.

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> He says he had a
stroke during surgery.

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.720 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's why
he passed away.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.010 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't expected.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:44.830 align:middle line:10%
He had heart complications
while he was alive,

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and he was going in
for an operation.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:90%
He says--

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it part of
your-- go ahead.

00:56:51.762 --> 00:56:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what he was
just talking about.

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:56.280 align:middle line:84%
He says that it was part of his
contract to leave when he did.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> He's mentioning his daughter
and his son that are still

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.580 align:middle line:90%
currently living right now.

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.320 align:middle line:84%
These two individuals,
they're not

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.730 align:middle line:90%
struggling as much as they were.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:10.760 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to come
out of this darkness.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
His daughter specifically
is encountering--

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.360 align:middle line:84%
having experiences with
him, but she's aware of it.

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So he wants her to
know that it's real,

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:22.685 align:middle line:90%
and she's not losing her mind.

00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It is her dad that's
coming to visit them.

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.120 align:middle line:10%
So what was the purpose of
your spiritual contract,

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.110 align:middle line:10%
to die so young?

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So he's really funny.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.420 align:middle line:84%
He says, my first mission with
my contract was to come in

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and to shed light on
the humanity on Earth.

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.040 align:middle line:84%
He says, I wanted to
bring laughter and humor

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to people, because during my
time frame of when I came in,

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people were
born without humor,

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:57.308 align:middle line:90%
or they had a foot up their ass.

00:57:57.308 --> 00:57:58.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:57:58.108 --> 00:58:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> He says, my movies and my
attitude came to enlighten

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.940 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason why I left
at such an early age in life

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:11.860 align:middle line:84%
was to give my relatives
the experience of loss.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, although I knew I was
going to transition at the age

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I did, when my death happened,
it was still shocking for me,

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:22.650 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't expecting
it, as most people don't.

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:24.550 align:middle line:90%
He's showing me his hair.

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:27.320 align:middle line:90%
He's got a head full of hair.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.120 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.240 align:middle line:84%
He's probably about,
I'd say, 6-foot tall.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But he's pointing out his hair
being in really good condition.

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:39.650 align:middle line:84%
It almost has a wave to
it, but it's slicked back.

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I still
have my good hair.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.920 align:middle line:90%
You're proud of your hair, huh?

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.250 align:middle line:90%
You were handsome!

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.672 align:middle line:90%
You were a handsome dude!

00:58:47.672 --> 00:58:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> He's very good-looking.

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw.

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, I didn't realize
that my looks were as good

00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:56.050 align:middle line:90%
as they were when I was alive.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I battled with
self-confidence issues,

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:03.040 align:middle line:84%
which is why I tended to
make fun of myself a lot.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I made it a joke,
because I didn't realize

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.353 align:middle line:90%
I was as good-looking as I was.

00:59:09.353 --> 00:59:10.153 align:middle line:90%
Something--

00:59:10.153 --> 00:59:13.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, why did you have
self-esteem issues, Bill?

00:59:13.036 --> 00:59:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's talking about some
of the self-esteem issues coming

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:18.490 align:middle line:90%
in from previous lifetimes.

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:20.365 align:middle line:90%
Something that had followed him.

00:59:20.365 --> 00:59:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And he says, when I
would look in the mirror,

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:26.386 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't see
prettiness or handsomeness.

00:59:26.386 --> 00:59:27.940 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that I didn't see.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But what I seen was beyond
the pretty or the handsome.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I see humor and a
good person, which

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.450 align:middle line:84%
is why I went into the
industry that I went into.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are you hanging
out with over there?

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> With quite a bit
of people, he says.

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm learning quite
a bit from your son.

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:48.270 align:middle line:84%
He's thanking you for
sharing him with him, because

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:50.520 align:middle line:84%
without Erik, I
wouldn't have learned

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.570 align:middle line:84%
how to manipulate energy the
way that I learned very quickly.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.430 align:middle line:84%
He says, Erik is a
really good teacher.

00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he really is.

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And so are you
learning that in part

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.865 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
your daughter, or?

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:03.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:03.665 --> 01:00:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What else do you use
energy manipulation for?

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Says, I'm learning how
to manipulate electronics,

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.800 align:middle line:84%
computers, cellphones,
lights, TVs.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.750 align:middle line:84%
He says, when things
start malfunctioning,

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:16.990 align:middle line:90%
know that I'm around.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.790 align:middle line:90%
He's laughing.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:19.792 align:middle line:84%
He says, Rich, you know
what I'm talking about.

01:00:19.792 --> 01:00:24.070 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Who else are you
hanging out with?

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So he's got his father.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:30.954 align:middle line:90%
He's also got a grandmother.

01:00:30.954 --> 01:00:34.120 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.710 align:middle line:84%
He's got Paul Walker who
he's hanging out with.

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Any other actors you're hanging
out with at all over there,

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.266 align:middle line:90%
beside Paul Walker?

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>> He's not an actor.

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Prince.

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.490 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.980 align:middle line:10%
Who else?

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.040 align:middle line:10%
>> He's got two gentlemen
that are coming forward.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.308 align:middle line:84%
I cannot get the name of
him for the life of me.

01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that it's
somebody that he's worked with

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and he's created movies with.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> He's showing a business
partner being associated with

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle line:90%
him.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Not just one movie.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It was multiples.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.840 align:middle line:10%
The movie that I'm looking
at, it's going to be--

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.610 align:middle line:10%
do you know the movie "Alien?"

01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:17.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:18.250 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like that.

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.500 align:middle line:10%
In other interviews,
somebody said

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.900 align:middle line:10%
that you also were hanging out
with the actor in "Big Love."

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of that movie,
but I know nothing about it.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
The actor's name is
Harry Dean Stanton.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the second
gentleman that's here.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you miss about being
on the planet, if anything?

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Physical touch
and smelling things.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
He says, you don't really
realize how you can't really

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
smell anything, or how you have
no desire to smell anything

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.240 align:middle line:90%
when you're dead.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, so my
desire to have smells

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.084 align:middle line:84%
that are on Earth, such
as flowers, grass--

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
really?

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:04.667 align:middle line:90%
He says poop.

01:02:04.667 --> 01:02:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Ew!

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:07.180 align:middle line:90%
How about your socks?

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, the dirty stuff.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, you miss those smells
when you cross over because you

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.860 align:middle line:90%
don't produce them anymore.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted, you can create
any smell that you want,

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and any food, but it's
not tangible like what

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.520 align:middle line:90%
you have on Earth.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:02:22.632 --> 01:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so where do you
hang out while you're

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.152 align:middle line:90%
over there, usually?

01:02:28.152 --> 01:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> He says I'm in between roles.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
He says, a lot of times,
I dance in my energy

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the third
dimension where humans are,

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
because I have family that
is still young, and is still

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:40.590 align:middle line:90%
needing me around.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So I like to keep my presence
around, a lot like Erik does.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.315 align:middle line:84%
He's taught me how
to dance in my energy

01:02:46.315 --> 01:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
so that people can feel me.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
He says, aside from that,
I have crossed over fully,

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
but I do not choose to be
completely over, as I am still

01:02:55.950 --> 01:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to be a part
of my family's life.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
He's showing me that he really
likes to ride cars and--

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.732 align:middle line:90%
is that a motorcycle?

01:03:10.732 --> 01:03:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It's some form of bike.

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
It's really loud.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.030 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't look like
your average motorcycle,

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:16.900 align:middle line:10%
so it's a different
type of bike.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.700 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:22.370 align:middle line:10%
>> And he says, these are the
types of things that I miss

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:23.366 align:middle line:10%
quite a bit.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:26.190 align:middle line:90%


01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
His food, his tasting.

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:33.784 align:middle line:84%
He likes Italian food, and
he's missing noodles and things

01:03:33.784 --> 01:03:34.930 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you do create
a landscape in heaven,

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.980 align:middle line:90%
what's your favorite to create?

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Looking at a racing track.

01:03:43.976 --> 01:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Bunch of cars going around.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And he has created it
like instantaneously.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that he's worked on.

01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:56.328 align:middle line:84%
He flashed a snap of
a finger, and I've

01:03:56.328 --> 01:03:57.620 align:middle line:90%
got a racetrack in front of me.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my god, you're so lucky.

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:07.580 align:middle line:10%
Do you prefer mountains,
meadows, forests, beaches?

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
What kind of landscape
do you prefer above all?

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:11.550 align:middle line:90%
The ocean?

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> He has water.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
He's showing me ocean.

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:21.000 align:middle line:10%
And he enjoys mountains,
but he enjoys the water more

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.320 align:middle line:10%
than he does mountains.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> He explains to me that he
would often find himself really

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
going and finding his own
thoughts when he was out

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
in nature, or when
he was around water.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
This is when I would
really figure out things,

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.455 align:middle line:84%
and I would have ideas that
would come to me about movies.

01:04:40.455 --> 01:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Or I would have a knowing of,
I've got to go to this state

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
to have a job there.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
He says, so when I found
time to go out in nature,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.950 align:middle line:84%
this is when I gathered
my thoughts the most.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So you were able to tap into
your intuition when you were

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.592 align:middle line:90%
in nature, I guess.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
He was really connected
to spirituality

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.340 align:middle line:90%
before he passed away.

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, so I knew that
there was life before death,

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.530 align:middle line:90%
but what I didn't know was this.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:13.490 align:middle line:90%
The structure of how life is.

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
He says, you automatically
assume that your physical body

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.348 align:middle line:90%
is not going to live on.

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
He says, the physical
body doesn't live on,

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
but you still carry what that
physical body had with it.

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
He says, I was just
more of a light being,

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to put
myself into another place

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:31.910 align:middle line:90%
with a thought.

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
walk, but it was

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
very much like
walking, but thinking.

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.710 align:middle line:90%
He says--

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about now,
over where you are, right?

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>> He says, I wasn't
expecting it to be this--

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.400 align:middle line:90%
he keeps snapping his fingers.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.180 align:middle line:10%
I can be anywhere I want
within the snap of a finger

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.550 align:middle line:10%
and without any
stress coming to me.

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:54.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.035 align:middle line:10%
Do you have any regrets about
your journey here on Earth?

01:05:57.035 --> 01:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Wish I would have spent
more time with my children.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Being as I was an actor and I
did quite a bit of traveling,

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
it did take away time from
me being with my family.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:10.490 align:middle line:10%
He says, so I just wish I would
have had more time with them.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
He says, but I don't
regret my life,

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really regret
anything that I've done.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I just wish I would have
had more time with them.

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I bet.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Any messages for
anybody in the family?

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> He gets quite emotional when
he's talking about his family.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And he gets emotional when
he talks about Rich as well.

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
He says, I just want them
to know that I'm happy,

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want anybody to
stress about any legal matters.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell them not to be upset,
and to know that I'm OK.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:42.500 align:middle line:90%
He's visiting them in dreams.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
His daughter specifically is
who's actually getting clear

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
knowing that he's there.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
He planted a seed with
that one, and she's

01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%
very open and very intuitive.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
He says his son is as well,
but he's more logic-minded,

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and so his son is having more
of a harder time with having him

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
be felt, or being able to
get through that dream,

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
because of that logic
and the grief that's

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.590 align:middle line:90%
still holding him down.

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:16.370 align:middle line:10%
He's telling his family
to play movies of him.

01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
That will raise their
vibration, and this

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
will help me to come and
visit you more frequently.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
My movies are my
laughter and my humor.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
He says his
personality was a lot

01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of his characters,
with funny and really

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:32.700 align:middle line:90%
nonchalant.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
seem very nonchalant.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you have a
specific message, for example,

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:38.720 align:middle line:90%
for your son?

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.524 align:middle line:84%
And then your daughter, or
then your wife, or anybody?

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:45.160 align:middle line:90%


01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
His son is more with grief
holding him down right now.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:53.820 align:middle line:10%
He's telling him that he
needs to speak to a therapist,

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.940 align:middle line:10%
because he's tending to
hold in his emotions,

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.920 align:middle line:10%
and it's not good for him.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.770 align:middle line:84%
He's telling him that he
couldn't have done anything

01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:03.240 align:middle line:90%
to prevent this.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.190 align:middle line:90%
None of the family could have.

01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Had they had done
different testing sooner,

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
he says my death still
would have happened.

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
His son is sitting
with grief of,

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I could have prevented this,
and you really couldn't have.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.279 align:middle line:10%
He says, so be OK with moving
on knowing that I'm happy

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:22.140 align:middle line:10%
and that I'm at peace.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Bill's daughter--

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:25.479 align:middle line:90%
>> His daughter.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
She is doing really better than
all of the rest of the family.

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what message
do you have for her?

01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:35.899 align:middle line:84%
>> He's telling her that I
want you to use your voice

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and communicating, and I want
you to use your voice with

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.550 align:middle line:90%
work.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.520 align:middle line:84%
There's either a movie or a
music, some type of roleplay

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.140 align:middle line:90%
that she's going to be doing.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
He's telling her
to use her voice.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So if there was a part that
she was trying to try out for,

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:55.279 align:middle line:90%
to use it, connected to music.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Your voice, or even
possibly voiceover.

01:08:58.210 --> 01:08:59.368 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.660 align:middle line:10%
That's the first thing that
came to my mind, voiceover.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.819 align:middle line:10%
What about anything
for your wife?

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>> He said thank
you for that one.

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And for his wife, he's
getting emotional.

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.904 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:09:12.904 --> 01:09:13.779 align:middle line:90%
>> He's sitting down.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Erik is holding him on his
shoulder, like a brother.

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so sweet, Erik.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
He says, she was
the love of my life,

01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:24.470 align:middle line:90%
and she is the love of my life.

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I will continue to
wait for her, and I

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.029 align:middle line:90%
will continue to live with her.

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:31.520 align:middle line:10%
No words that I can give
her that can make her

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.899 align:middle line:10%
feel any better.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
She's lost her other
half, and I feel the grief

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.939 align:middle line:90%
that she has lost.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's OK for you to
move on, and it's OK for you

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
to be happy.

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:47.021 align:middle line:84%
He's telling her to take care
of her heart and her diet,

01:09:47.021 --> 01:09:48.979 align:middle line:84%
because there are some
issues that are going on

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:50.305 align:middle line:90%
for her physically.

01:09:50.305 --> 01:09:54.296 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell us what you
think about Rich Martini.

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Anything you want to tell him?

01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Any impressions about his work,
about how y'all became pals?

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> He's showing me that
they became friends through

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.607 align:middle line:90%
the filming business.

01:10:05.607 --> 01:10:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Neither of them were
really well-known

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.160 align:middle line:10%
when they started
interacting with each other.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.015 align:middle line:90%
The bond that grew very quickly.

01:10:14.015 --> 01:10:16.550 align:middle line:90%


01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:19.700 align:middle line:10%
The movie-- this
might even be "Alien."

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the movie
"Alien" that he's showing me.

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's in connection to that
what sparked a relationship

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.950 align:middle line:90%
with him.

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
He says, that's when my
relationship really grew.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.800 align:middle line:10%
He says, it's the interest
in the paranormal,

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.010 align:middle line:10%
and the interest in the movies
that are just unexplainable,

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.590 align:middle line:10%
why Rich and I connected.

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:44.660 align:middle line:10%
He says, we're both like-minded.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.830 align:middle line:10%
Rich is more of a soulmate
and not much of a friend.

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:49.700 align:middle line:90%
He's a soulmate.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
He says he's the best
friend, and someone who

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I lived multiple lives with.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.040 align:middle line:10%
Rich is at a pause
right now, and he

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.030 align:middle line:10%
says that he's really not sure
which direction he wants to go.

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:05.270 align:middle line:10%
Rich, you constantly think about
where it is that you're going,

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.800 align:middle line:10%
or what you want to do.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Bill is telling you
to go with where

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.005 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts are putting you.

01:11:10.005 --> 01:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you find that you're
going to go with something,

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
don't go back to
your old habits.

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, stick to one
road and go with it,

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.950 align:middle line:84%
even if it gets
hard, or if you feel

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:20.342 align:middle line:90%
like it's not going anywhere.

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:21.800 align:middle line:84%
He says, stick with
it and you will

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.300 align:middle line:90%
see change that will happen.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.890 align:middle line:10%
He's talking about
finances changing for Rich,

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:29.980 align:middle line:10%
and it's happening this year.

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.500 align:middle line:10%
There's some type of document--

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.900 align:middle line:10%
documentary that Rich
is either working on

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.570 align:middle line:10%
right now, or there's
something in the progress

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.220 align:middle line:10%
that he needs to finish.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.630 align:middle line:10%
This is going to help him turn
the documentary into either--

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.660 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIO OUT]

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.530 align:middle line:10%
--series, something that's
going to be going on long-term.

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Either a what?

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:52.855 align:middle line:90%
>> He said a movie or a series.

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, got it.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Any other advice for Rich?

01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> He says, you need
to work on yourself,

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and he says that you also need
to take care of your health.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
He's not throwing him
under the bus, he says.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So just know that I'm trying
to help you out as a friend.

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm really
happy that you

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
have found your way into Rich's
heart, and into Rich's life.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's not
by coincidence.

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:20.350 align:middle line:84%
This is also something
that is contracted.

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Rich is supposed to know
you because of this work

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that you are doing
with Erik, and--

01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:28.915 align:middle line:84%
>> The work that he's
doing with the afterlife.

01:12:28.915 --> 01:12:32.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I first met Bill Paxton in
a pub in London in the fall

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
of 1985.

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.770 align:middle line:90%
He was making a film "Aliens."

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Bill told me he was an actor,
but I didn't recognize him

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.920 align:middle line:90%
until he laughed.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.750 align:middle line:90%
That laugh.

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Otherworldly.

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It put you at ease.

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:55.750 align:middle line:90%
It was like family.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, we toyed
with working together.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.180 align:middle line:90%
He rewrote a script for me.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.880 align:middle line:90%
He was going to star in it.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.800 align:middle line:90%
But show business intervened.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.799 align:middle line:84%
We spent time hanging out at the
Cannes Film Festival together.

01:13:07.799 --> 01:13:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Luana was a big fan.

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.972 align:middle line:84%
He was a
bigger-than-life person,

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:16.930 align:middle line:84%
but he had a deeply-profound
yet winsome quality to him.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
He had the innate ability
to make everyone in the room

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
feel like everything was
going to be OK because he

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.060 align:middle line:90%
was their best friend.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
As Kimberly put it
in her interview,

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.262 align:middle line:84%
when I asked if I could talk
to my friend Bill, she said,

01:13:31.262 --> 01:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
he's been waiting
to talk to you.

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I was thrilled to hear
it, like anyone would be.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone wants
to talk to Billy.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.035 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wanted to be
part of his journey.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He joked with Jennifer
Shaffer a number

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of times about me
making this very film.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, buddy, he said, we finally
got to make a film together.

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I know how odd that sounds,
but he was the one who said it.

You finally got your
Bill Paxton movie, man!

01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that our
loved ones still exist

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make it any
easier when they depart.

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But it does ease the
pain to know they still

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.015 align:middle line:84%
keep an eye on us
from the flip side.

01:14:17.015 --> 01:14:19.300 align:middle line:10%
[CHEERING]

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> American actor Bill Paxton,
who rose to stardom with roles

01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood blockbusters
such as "Aliens" and "Titanic"

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:26.930 align:middle line:90%
has died.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.300 align:middle line:90%
He was 61.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
His family issued a
statement saying the actor

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
died after complications
from surgery.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I've have always
been a filmmaker at heart.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Paxton, who appeared in
dozens of films over some four

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
decades, recently starred in
the HBO TV series "Big Love."

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
He won a Screen Actors
Guild award for his role

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:45.745 align:middle line:90%
in "Apollo 13"--

01:14:45.745 --> 01:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a pretty
full-on experience.

01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:51.190 align:middle line:10%
>> --and was nominated for three
Golden Globe awards for his

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:54.880 align:middle line:10%
work in "Big Love" and the 1990
miniseries "A Bright Shining

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.750 align:middle line:10%
Lie."

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:59.080 align:middle line:10%
Paxton leaves behind his
wife and two children.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Breaking news right now.

01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:02.920 align:middle line:10%
The family of actor
Bill Paxton confirms

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.800 align:middle line:10%
he died due to
complications from surgery.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.630 align:middle line:10%
He was just 61 years old.

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:10.450 align:middle line:10%
Earlier this month, Paxton
paid a visit to our studios

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:13.780 align:middle line:10%
to talk about his new CBS
series, "Training Day."

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.880 align:middle line:10%
His career spanned
several decades.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.590 align:middle line:10%
He's known for
roles in "Titanic,"

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:20.110 align:middle line:10%
"Apollo 13," and "Aliens."

01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Got some great
salty old mines?

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:24.127 align:middle line:84%
>> My dad was a traveling
salesman for many years.

01:15:24.127 --> 01:15:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And he would come home,
and he would come up

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
with these different
expressions.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, on the
movies you're shooting,

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.942 align:middle line:84%
the writer's written a line,
but it's pretty cliché,

01:15:32.942 --> 01:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and you want to find a
different way to say it.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.308 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing "True
Lies," for example,

01:15:37.308 --> 01:15:39.475 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this scene where
I'm driving the Corvette,

01:15:39.475 --> 01:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to sell
Arnold the Corvette.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.495 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to be
talking about Jamie Lee Curtis.

01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to be talking
about her breasts to--

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know that this is
her husband I'm talking to.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And so Jim Cameron said, well,
come up with something here.

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered a line my
dad used to say, so I said,

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
what if I say, her breasts make
me want to stand up and bawl

01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:02.320 align:middle line:90%
for buttermilk.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And I--

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.037 align:middle line:84%
>> You ever use this on
the ladies, my friend?

01:16:05.037 --> 01:16:06.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, OK, well, it
was perfect for that.

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.075 align:middle line:90%
>> How's that go over at a bar?

01:16:10.075 --> 01:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Your breasts you want
to stand up and bawl

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:14.340 align:middle line:90%
for buttermilk.

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.345 align:middle line:90%
Later, at the hospital--

01:16:15.345 --> 01:16:17.200 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
--Mr. Paxton, wake up!

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> After "Twister," I couldn't
do a bigger commercial film.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.700 align:middle line:10%
And it was a special
effects-driven movie

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.470 align:middle line:10%
about the tornadoes.

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.630 align:middle line:10%
And so as an actor,
I didn't really

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:33.240 align:middle line:10%
get to do a heck of
a lot in that movie.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.820 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted to get
back to do the kind

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.532 align:middle line:10%
of character-driven
work that I got

01:16:37.532 --> 01:16:39.240 align:middle line:10%
to do in a picture a
few years ago called

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.050 align:middle line:10%
"One False Move," which was
a great independent film,

01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:47.280 align:middle line:10%
and was one of the best acting
roles that ever came down

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.660 align:middle line:10%
the road for me.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to get back
to doing that kind of work.

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.970 align:middle line:10%
I like to kind of mix it up.

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:56.910 align:middle line:10%
It's great to do the
big commercial films.

01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:00.450 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have been
able to raise the money

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:04.680 align:middle line:10%
to finance "Traveller" if
it wasn't for "Twister."

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.700 align:middle line:10%
And this was a script that
my wife found four years ago.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And "One False Move" was
a real departure for me.

01:17:12.810 --> 01:17:15.720 align:middle line:10%
It put me in a position with
a lot of serious filmmakers

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.680 align:middle line:10%
in Hollywood, like Ron
Howard and [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.370 align:middle line:10%
This was the movie they saw, and
they saw me as a leading man.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:26.190 align:middle line:10%
Before that, I had done
some leads in some movies.

01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:29.070 align:middle line:10%
But for the most part, I was
known as a working character

01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:33.480 align:middle line:10%
actor doing parts in movies like
"Weird Science" and "Aliens"

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.980 align:middle line:10%
and "True Lies."

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.470 align:middle line:10%
So I saw a great opportunity.

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:40.350 align:middle line:10%
I think you get to a
point in your career

01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:44.110 align:middle line:10%
where you really need to take
the reins and try to do--

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
and it's always been
my dream for 20 years

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.970 align:middle line:10%
to produce a movie
that I could act in.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:54.930 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted to be involved in
the casting, in the director,

01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:58.250 align:middle line:10%
in the editing, in the
music, in the art direction.

01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.625 align:middle line:10%
I don't know who's seen it
the most times in here besides

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.480 align:middle line:10%
probably me.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.312 align:middle line:10%
How many times?

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:04.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably seen
it about 10 times.

01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Nice.

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:06.528 align:middle line:10%
Nice.

01:18:06.528 --> 01:18:07.570 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for the residuals.

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:08.370 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>> --sum up my
friendship with him.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.790 align:middle line:84%
In a soundbite, he
was a dear friend.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.040 align:middle line:10%
He was family, and--

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.120 align:middle line:10%
yeah, I'm having--
it's been a hard day.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.220 align:middle line:10%
I thought about not coming,
and Josh reminded me

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:24.400 align:middle line:10%
that Bill loves everything
Hollywood tradition, Hollywood

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.870 align:middle line:10%
history, and he
would have kicked

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:27.520 align:middle line:10%
my butt if I didn't come.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And he left behind such
a great body of work that,

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
whenever we're missing him or
we want to hang out with him,

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:33.940 align:middle line:90%
we can.

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:36.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Finally, tonight here,
with so much attention paid

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.950 align:middle line:10%
to the Oscars, tonight we
celebrate one more Hollywood

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:39.760 align:middle line:10%
favorite--

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.810 align:middle line:10%
Bill Paxton.

01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
He was in so many great
movies, and tonight, his fans,

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
his colleagues, Tom Hanks
all remembering him.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.542 align:middle line:90%
Here's Kayna Whitworth.

01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> He was a Hollywood
favorite, and the world learned

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
of the loss just hours
before the Oscars.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us who the
woman in the picture is?

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill Paxton was a prolific
actor known for roles

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
in blockbuster movies
like "Titanic."

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us, Rose.

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:02.895 align:middle line:10%
>> It's been 84 years.

01:19:02.895 --> 01:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> One of Paxton's
first big breaks,

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.240 align:middle line:84%
the obnoxious older brother
Chet in "Weird Science."

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you realize it's
snowing in my room?

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:12.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Then, "Aliens."

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:13.856 align:middle line:10%
>> That's great.

01:19:13.856 --> 01:19:17.275 align:middle line:84%
>> And later, taking the
starring role in "Twister."

01:19:17.275 --> 01:19:19.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Tighten your seat belt.

01:19:19.466 --> 01:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> One of his most
critically-acclaimed roles,

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.160 align:middle line:90%
"Apollo 13."

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Uh, Houston, we got a
pretty large bang there,

01:19:25.205 --> 01:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
especially with
the master alarm.

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.860 align:middle line:90%

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
to Tinseltown.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:44.070 align:middle line:10%

ABC News, Los Angeles.

01:19:57.970 --> 01:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%

when you did that.

Who am I?

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> You're here at Cannes.

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What hole are we playing?

01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:06.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Saw "Into the Wild" recently.

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:08.530 align:middle line:10%
And that was like
the first movie

I've seen in a while
where I left, I was like.

01:20:10.537 --> 01:20:11.870 align:middle line:10%
I was thinking about it all day.

01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:15.270 align:middle line:10%
>> That could make a good
double bill to "Mean Dreams."

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.500 align:middle line:10%
Both kind of road
pictures, on the road.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.825 align:middle line:10%
You end up in a bus.

>> Same thing, right?

01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Except it's a little--

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.125 align:middle line:84%
it's a little
different, I guess.
