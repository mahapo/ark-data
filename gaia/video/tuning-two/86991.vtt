00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:16.143
♫ So many sunrises lost to long dreams

3
00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.103
♫ Myriad sunsets fall faded, unseen

4
00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.463
♫ Thinking of all I have missed in between

5
00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:28.421
♫ Life is a window in time

6
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.319
♫ Life is a window in time

7
00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:38.045
♫ The tall grass longs for the press of your feet

8
00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:42.371
♫ The river remembers how you used to meet

9
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:46.741
♫ The little birds echo your voice soft and sweet

10
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:50.329
♫ And the whispering wind calls your name ♫

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.592
<v ->I started channeling around 1995,1996.</v>

12
00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:01.792 line:15% 
I was sitting at home

13
00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.644 line:15% 
reading a book one evening,

14
00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:08.703 line:15% 
on, I believe it was Kryon's Book Four

15
00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:13.353
and suddenly I felt my body shifting energetically

16
00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:16.653
and two words came through,

17
00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:18.953
I actually channeled two words.

18
00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:23.709
I channeled, "love you"

19
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.562
and that was the beginning for me.

20
00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:31.462
♫ l dwell in each moment and savor each day

21
00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:36.212
♫ Choices yield memories, sand shifts away

22
00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:40.412
♫ Why would one choose in the darkness to stay

23
00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:44.818
♫ Life is a window in time

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:48.121

<v ->2005 that I started channeling,</v>

26
00:01:50.427 --> 00:01:54.274 line:15% 
and firstly, let's see,

27
00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:56.324 line:15% 
I had, from a very young age,

28
00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.192 line:15% 
been very interested in metaphysics.

29
00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:03.542
(harmonica playing)

30
00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:08.604 line:15% 
<v ->It was back in the early 80s,</v>

31
00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:13.004 line:15% 
and my husband and I regularly went to several channels

32
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:17.010
for advice and assistance.

33
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.260
♫ Life is a window in time

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.160
♫ Life is a window in time ♫

35
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.710 line:15% 
<v ->It's more of a heart-to-heart feeling,</v>

36
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.710 line:15% 
and one of the things that I do in my work,

37
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.013 line:15% 
and not only do I work as a trance channeler,

38
00:02:34.013 --> 00:02:37.813 line:15% 
but I also do intuitive readings with people

39
00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:40.613
that are more or less conscious channeling,

40
00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:44.413
and in that process, I always first connect God,

41
00:02:44.413 --> 00:02:47.066
and then I bring through a beam of light through my heart

42
00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.016
and connect to the other person,

43
00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:51.016
and then I just loop it back,

44
00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:54.866
and I create, in essence, a loop of energy

45
00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:58.666
and then I just start feeling and assessing

46
00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.816
who you are on a soul level,

47
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:03.966
and it's amazing the information that comes through

48
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.477
when you start doing that with people.

49
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:11.274
(harmonica playing)

50
00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:16.077 line:15% 
<v ->I prefer to have my feet on the ground,</v>

51
00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:18.433 line:15% 
that's one of the first thing I acknowledge,

52
00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:21.183 line:15% 
is that it's a connection to the Earth.

53
00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:26.983
And as I lower my eyes, I already feel

54
00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:29.433
that there is a part of me that somehow

55
00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:33.836
is a little less than present in the body.

56
00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:37.389
It's a very expansive process for me.

57
00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.739
I begin to feel instead of a heartbeat,

58
00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.186
it feels a little bit more like a pulse,

59
00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:45.836
like a rhythm that somehow belongs

60
00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:50.089
more to the Earth than to me, and it accepts me.

61
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.542
And as I do that,

62
00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:56.345
I go a little further into the experience.

63
00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:01.845
I become a little less aware of my environment,

64
00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.445
or perhaps a little bit more inclusive

65
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.048
of everything that is in the environment,

66
00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:11.501
and the boundaries begin to dissolve a little bit.

67
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.851
♫ They say that a raven, you rarely will see

68
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.953

00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:24.653
♫ The others stay with him until he is free

from the universe, the energies of love,

73
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.109 line:15% 
peace, healing, joy,

74
00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:39.759
passion, and compassion,

75
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.059
you bring it in through your right brain,

76
00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.309
through your heart, down the left side of your body,

77
00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:48.259
back up and around, so it's in the shape of infinity,

78
00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.962
so you have the infinite energies

79
00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:55.162
of peace, healing, joy, passion,

80
00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:57.512

<v ->What happens is the writer gets an idea</v>

84
00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.101 line:15% 
and they start writing, and all the sudden,

85
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.401 line:15% 
they get another idea and they start writing even faster

86
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:12.904 line:15% 
and faster because they're afraid

87
00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:13.913
they're going to lose they're going to lose

88
00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.213
the first idea, that is channeling,

89
00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.863
and that is exactly what happens to writers,

90
00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:20.213
it happens to artists that become inspired,

91
00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:22.663
and suddenly they put down the canvas they're working on,

92
00:05:22.663 --> 00:05:24.513
because they see a vision in their head

93
00:05:24.513 --> 00:05:26.113
and they do their best to bring it out.

94
00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:29.263
Or the musician that suddenly picks up

95
00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:31.013
something and starts playing something

96
00:05:31.013 --> 00:05:32.769
they'd never heard before,

97
00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.031
and just completely in the spirit.

98
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:39.181
(mystical music)

99
00:05:40.937 --> 00:05:45.193
<v ->I started studying metaphysical ideas</v>

100
00:05:45.193 --> 00:05:47.746
and for many years, I always had an interest,

101
00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:48.949
I was very inquisitive about it,

102
00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.799
but I never considered myself psychic, or especially gifted.

103
00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:55.455
And I went through all my ups and downs in life,

104
00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.555
like we all do, that roller coaster,

105
00:05:57.555 --> 00:05:59.158
of some times when I believe strongly,

106
00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.611
and other times when I was, what is this,

107
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.570
what am I doing, is this really what it's all about,

108
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.573
is there really more to this life?

109
00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:10.673
So, I went through those ups and downs,

110
00:06:10.673 --> 00:06:13.173
and actually was in one of those down cycles,

111
00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:17.126
where I had gone through a disbelief, I had,

112
00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:21.485
I was kind of depressed, thinking,

113
00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:24.235
I kind of had a scientific view in my mind

114
00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:27.485
of, you know, maybe there is no world after this,

115
00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:29.985
maybe there is no answer, and there is no meaning to life,

116
00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:32.035
and it got me in a very depressed mode,

117
00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:35.838
and what I realized was that I had read so much

118
00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:38.538
about, we create our own realities,

119
00:06:38.538 --> 00:06:41.738
and what I realized from being in that very down state

120
00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:45.441
was that I was creating that, and I could choose

121
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.541
what I wanted to create, and was this working for me,

122
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:53.041
absolutely not, you know, so why not choose something

123
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:55.441
more profound about life?

124
00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:57.641
<v ->Well, I had a sense of,</v>

125
00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:01.903
I had entered into a whole new reality

126
00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:03.915
that felt more real to me,

127
00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:07.015
it felt more comforting to me,

128
00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:09.765
more in alignment with who I actually am,

129
00:07:09.765 --> 00:07:14.265
and I had tears coming down my eyes, tears of joy,

130
00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:17.565
and it just was a fascinating experience,

131
00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:20.218
so I just remained in that space after those two words

132
00:07:20.218 --> 00:07:22.571
came through and just relaxed in that energy

133
00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:25.921
and sensation for probably a half hour or so,

134
00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:27.871
and just really soaked it all in,

135
00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:30.221
and appreciated what was the change

136
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:34.071
and that transformation that was taking place there for me.

137
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.171
I had seen the...

138
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:40.027
It seemed very real, very natural,

139
00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:45.127
very rich and nurturing and comforting to me.

140
00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:48.886
It also seemed like something that I wanted

141
00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:51.386
to experience more, like it was a path

142
00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:55.589
for me to embark on, a journey, a direction,

143
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:59.039
it was of great value for me to move further along

144
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.845
and experience more of that.

145
00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:03.045
<v ->You know, I was a really shy child,</v>

146
00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:06.445
and so it was easy for me to go inward.

147
00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:09.545
I was always looking for some kind of answer,

148
00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:11.998
even as a young child.

149
00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:16.098
What it looked like was just colors

150
00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:20.198
that had a movement to it that was directed,

151
00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:23.498
so it wasn't colors in the way that a rainbow is stable,

152
00:08:23.498 --> 00:08:26.298
it had a movement that felt as if it was directed

153
00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.757
by something greater than what I was aware of,

154
00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:30.157
so I knew it was something.

155
00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:33.157
But it gave me a confirmation to know that,

156
00:08:33.157 --> 00:08:36.256
right or wrong, this is where I am, this is who I am,

157
00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:38.460
and there isn't anything that's gonna change that,

158
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.263
whether I go to these seminars or not,

159
00:08:40.263 --> 00:08:42.263
or stay by myself for the rest of my life,

160
00:08:42.263 --> 00:08:46.115
and whether it's a gift or not, this is who and what I am.

161
00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:49.415
<v ->So we realized I had a little bit of a talent for this,</v>

162
00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:51.465
so we kept developing it,

163
00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:55.215
and I even went to a class in channeling,

164
00:08:55.215 --> 00:08:58.027
taught by an old-fashioned,

165
00:08:58.027 --> 00:09:02.327
old-timey spiritualist, a medium,

166
00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:06.633
and the last class of the series, he said,

167
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:10.033
"Now, instead of just tuning into your spirit guide

168
00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.833
"and getting messages and getting information,

169
00:09:14.393 --> 00:09:17.539
"let this guide speak through you."

170
00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:23.395
And everybody was all nervous, like, "Through me?"

171
00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:26.195
You know, it was such a strange experience,

172
00:09:26.195 --> 00:09:29.395
and indeed, it came through me,

173
00:09:29.395 --> 00:09:33.598
it was like a channel of light opened up into my head

174
00:09:33.598 --> 00:09:36.948
and this energy came into my head,

175
00:09:36.948 --> 00:09:39.698
I kind of was bounced backwards

176
00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:43.857
and I was like, like that, and up against the wall,

177
00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:47.807
so to speak, and this voice came in,

178
00:09:47.807 --> 00:09:51.657
it was not my voice, I felt it come in from above

179
00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.257
and resonate in my head,

180
00:09:55.507 --> 00:09:58.860
and that just shocked me.

181
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.910
It just felt so strange, but it was so distinct,

182
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.110
I could not deny that it had happened.

183
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.960
<v ->Went to this evening thing on December 31st of 1995,</v>

184
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.510
and the whole idea was to get together

185
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.660
and go through everything that you experienced

186
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.810
during the year, and to write it down,

187
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.213
so that you had an inventory of all the important things

188
00:10:21.213 --> 00:10:23.363
that had happened in your entire life.

189
00:10:23.363 --> 00:10:25.713
You're supposed to take that paper, tear it up,

190
00:10:25.713 --> 00:10:28.066
and wad up the things you're going to release

191
00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:30.666
and throw it in the fire, and then we were going to read

192
00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:32.975
the rest of them to the rising sun.

193
00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:35.275
Okay, you know what, I can do this, no problem.

194
00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:37.728
Rip the thing in half, wad it up, throw it in there,

195
00:10:37.728 --> 00:10:39.628
everybody goes, "Ho!"

196
00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:41.228
I thought that was wild.

197
00:10:41.228 --> 00:10:45.181
And held the thing up to the rising sun,

198
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:47.287
pulled my paper, I had three lines to read,

199
00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:48.987
I don't even remember what they were,

200
00:10:48.987 --> 00:10:52.187
I couldn't focus on them, and I'm going,

201
00:10:52.187 --> 00:10:54.687
okay, I know they're here, and then,

202
00:10:56.057 --> 00:10:58.343
I had the biggest rush I think I've ever had in my life,

203
00:10:58.343 --> 00:11:00.893
I don't know whether you'd call it a kundalini experience,

204
00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:03.643
I don't know whether you'd call it an opening,

205
00:11:03.643 --> 00:11:05.893
or whatever it was, but I was basically

206
00:11:05.893 --> 00:11:08.743
hugged by the Group for the first time.

207
00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:11.893
And the tears just started, here I am,

208
00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:14.046
here, holding this paper up,

209
00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:16.046
and the tears are coming down so much,

210
00:11:16.046 --> 00:11:20.046
my shirt's getting wet, you know, it's 5:30 in the morning,

211
00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:22.846
so it's kind of cold out, and my shirt's getting wet,

212
00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:25.196
and also, I was--

213
00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:27.746
all night, I was so afraid of looking foolish,

214
00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:30.946
and here I am, crying my eyes out in front of these people

215
00:11:30.946 --> 00:11:34.146
and I hear somebody laughing at me over my shoulder,

216
00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:36.746
and I'm going, okay, well somebody's laughing,

217
00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:38.299
they're probably laughing at all of this,

218
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:40.199
they're not laughing at me, you know, it's okay,

219
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:43.099
I just kind of washed the whole thing off,

220
00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:45.249
and then I came over and I stopped crying

221
00:11:45.249 --> 00:11:47.899
and all I could say is, "I will be a light worker."

222
00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:50.549
That's the only words that came out of my mouth,

223
00:11:50.549 --> 00:11:52.852
and it was just very, very beautiful.

224
00:11:52.852 --> 00:11:54.952
And I looked over to see who was laughing at me.

225
00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:57.002
There was nobody on the beach.

226
00:11:57.002 --> 00:11:59.758
There was no cars, there was nobody else anywhere around.

227
00:11:59.758 --> 00:12:01.158
That was the Group,

228
00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:03.058
that's the first time I heard from the Group.

229
00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:06.561
<v ->Each of the guides that make up Paulayro have always</v>

230
00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:10.561
and forever been teachers, master spirit teachers.

231
00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:14.761
I can channel people who have been on the Earth.

232
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:19.714
I believe my contract is to only channel

233
00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:22.964
these very highly evolved spirit teachers.

234
00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:26.120
<v ->We specifically invite</v>

235
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.620
the presence of God to be with us,

236
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.520
We specifically invite the highest,

237
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.220
most loving beings of light.

238
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.170
We welcome our most loving

239
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.220
guardian angels and spirit guides.

240
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.370
We welcome ascended masters, saints,

241
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.520
and the most loving beings of light

242
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.220
that are with us, to come and be with us now,

243
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.720
to participate in this communication experience.

244
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.320
(mystical music)

245
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.570
<v ->We are here at a juncture of time and space</v>

246
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.635 line:15% 
that is becoming critical on your planet.

247
00:13:09.635 --> 00:13:13.185 line:15% 
We are here to help you remember parts of yourselves

248
00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:15.438 line:15% 
and what you are doing here,

249
00:13:15.438 --> 00:13:18.938
and what your aim was when you first came here.

250
00:13:18.938 --> 00:13:21.753
And now you are reaching a stage

251
00:13:21.753 --> 00:13:24.553
where you are reaching a critical mass,

252
00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:28.003
and what is taking place is people are starting

253
00:13:28.003 --> 00:13:30.212
to evolve faster

254
00:13:30.212 --> 00:13:34.012
than they can acclimate the evolution.

255
00:13:34.012 --> 00:13:38.262
And what is taking place on planet Earth right now

256
00:13:38.262 --> 00:13:41.212
is rather interesting for all of us,

257
00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:43.362
because it was not scripted.

258
00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:48.227
You have gone beyond the original plan on Earth.

259
00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:52.077
You have gone beyond your original ideas

260
00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.327
of how you would live in planet Earth,

261
00:13:54.327 --> 00:13:57.627
and you have moved from a field of duality

262
00:13:57.627 --> 00:14:00.027
and seeing everything in contrast,

263
00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:04.477
and starting to move into a field that we call triality,

264
00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:07.227
where you now have a new balance

265
00:14:07.227 --> 00:14:09.877
of the higher self and a connection.

266
00:14:09.877 --> 00:14:13.827
The hearts that this particular message is going to reach

267
00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:18.127
has the capabilities of changing this world,

268
00:14:18.127 --> 00:14:20.177
just within themselves,

269
00:14:20.177 --> 00:14:23.927
and each one of them knows who they are,

270
00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:26.427
so we will speak of this momentarily,

271
00:14:26.427 --> 00:14:28.727
to be able to reach the audience

272
00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:31.777
that is actually by contract.

273
00:14:31.777 --> 00:14:34.180 line:15% 
<v ->There was a freedom of the Earth now,</v>

274
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.430 line:15% 
that which must be heard, in some ways,

275
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.036 line:15% 
that which demands to be heard.

276
00:14:38.036 --> 00:14:41.386 line:15% 
<v ->And many of you feel this, many of you inherently know,</v>

277
00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:46.089 line:15% 
you recognize, you feel in your gut, so to speak,

278
00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:48.642
that something is happening,

279
00:14:48.642 --> 00:14:51.092
something important is happening,

280
00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:53.642
and it is time to awaken,

281
00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:57.348
and you see much dismay

282
00:14:57.348 --> 00:15:00.998
and economic difficulties

283
00:15:00.998 --> 00:15:04.148
and old systems breaking down.

284
00:15:04.148 --> 00:15:08.348
All of these are a sign that you are ready for the change.

285
00:15:08.348 --> 00:15:10.301
You need to let go of these systems,

286
00:15:10.301 --> 00:15:11.651
they need to break down,

287
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:14.251
you need not be sad about them breaking down.

288
00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:17.551
They are the old way.

289
00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:19.951
You have lived centuries and centuries

290
00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:24.107
of pushing against certain systems

291
00:15:24.107 --> 00:15:27.466
that diminish the spirit of the individual.

292
00:15:28.816 --> 00:15:31.566
It is time for the individual

293
00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:34.716
to recognize their inherent power.

294
00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:37.272
<v ->So those voices that used to be crying</v>

295
00:15:37.272 --> 00:15:40.972
in the darkness sometimes now have light behind them,

296
00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:44.022
and we tell you, it's a very beautiful thing

297
00:15:44.022 --> 00:15:46.622
that's happening, because it is not possible

298
00:15:46.622 --> 00:15:50.372
to keep secrets on planet Earth any longer,

299
00:15:50.372 --> 00:15:53.275
and that is going to cause great challenges

300
00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:56.575
and will affect many innocent people's lives.

301
00:15:56.575 --> 00:16:01.125
It will cause the economic systems to crumble,

302
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:04.325
to where the point to where they can find solid ground

303
00:16:04.325 --> 00:16:06.675
and rebuild on solid ground.

304
00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:10.275
Yes, and this is exactly what most of you

305
00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:12.975
have always dreamt about coming:

306
00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:17.175
a new energy, a new way of combining things.

307
00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:19.578 line:15% 
<v ->What is really happening is that there's this</v>

308
00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:24.128 line:15% 
kind of gradual increase in consciousness

309
00:16:24.128 --> 00:16:26.578 line:15% 
with this individual, that individual,

310
00:16:26.578 --> 00:16:29.078 line:15% 
that one, this one, that one over there.

311
00:16:29.078 --> 00:16:30.828
The lights are coming on,

312
00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:34.140
people are awakening all over the place.

313
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.040
<v ->And so there are energies</v>

314
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.390 line:15% 
of positive change and transformation in place,

315
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.140 line:15% 
and so there are great potentialities,

316
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.440 line:15% 
so we would like there to be more hope and optimism

317
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.140
to help bring about this tidal wave of prosperity

318
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.799
that is waiting to take place.

319
00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:58.199
<v ->So there was a lot of things that had happened</v>

320
00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:02.349
only recently, only in the very last moments of humanity,

321
00:17:02.349 --> 00:17:05.949
as you awoken from the dream and started to take your power,

322
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:08.349
and you have moved incredibly fast.

323
00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.152
<v ->The potentials from humanity, in essence,</v>

324
00:17:10.152 --> 00:17:13.955
are to become less human and more divine,

325
00:17:13.955 --> 00:17:16.104
a little bit closer to the heavens,

326
00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:19.205
a little bit so that the body is not as dense.

327
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.455
<v ->When you get that, that is caught,</v>

328
00:17:22.455 --> 00:17:27.366
just like a virus, like flu is caught, by others.

329
00:17:27.366 --> 00:17:30.068
<v ->There is energies that move through the universe,</v>

330
00:17:30.068 --> 00:17:34.424
so that they are drawn toward a collection or a collective

331
00:17:34.424 --> 00:17:38.824
of energies that is potentially enlivening itself,

332
00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:43.127
and so, in this small quadrant of this galaxy,

333
00:17:43.127 --> 00:17:46.627
within this solar system, the energies have gathered,

334
00:17:46.627 --> 00:17:49.427
there is awareness within the cycles of time

335
00:17:49.427 --> 00:17:52.027
that this is a time of great possibility.

336
00:17:52.027 --> 00:17:56.180
And so, yes, you may call it an evolutionary leap for some.

337
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.930
<v ->The energy shift is causing that realization,</v>

338
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.239
and that is why so many of your systems are breaking down.

339
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.489
And you should allow this and be grateful

340
00:18:07.489 --> 00:18:11.989
for the breaking down of your material world possessions,

341
00:18:11.989 --> 00:18:13.442
and the need for them,

342
00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:15.345
because this is allowing an awakening.

343
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:18.198
<v ->But the veils are thinner, now, you see?</v>

344
00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:20.498
The acceleration of energies,

345
00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:22.648
the movement toward the fifth dimension,

346
00:18:22.648 --> 00:18:27.098
all of this makes the progression of energies thinner.

347
00:18:27.098 --> 00:18:30.098 line:15% 
<v ->Well, you have certainly been raising</v>

348
00:18:30.098 --> 00:18:32.551 line:15% 
your vibration of consciousness,

349
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:35.401 line:15% 
and in your world, you have the idea

350
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.851 line:15% 
of the speed of light, and so,

351
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:42.157
as you raise your understanding of yourself,

352
00:18:42.157 --> 00:18:45.807
your vibrational rate as a being,

353
00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:48.657
energetically and physiologically,

354
00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:53.107
your molecules, your atoms, your subatomic particles

355
00:18:53.107 --> 00:18:56.057
are resonating at a higher rate

356
00:18:56.057 --> 00:18:59.907
that is more at the speed of light, but still not there.

357
00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:03.007
<v ->It's simple to see that humanity is evolving</v>

358
00:19:03.007 --> 00:19:05.857
and moving from this level to this level.

359
00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:09.457
Each one of you has gone through something very similar,

360
00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:11.507
as you have awakened from the dream

361
00:19:11.507 --> 00:19:13.560
and started to take your place,

362
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.460
as a healer or as a teacher or whoever you are,

363
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.110
and what your rightful place is in the universe.

364
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.810
And many times, that has looked like an explosion,

365
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.060
because it has happened so fast,

366
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.060
and many times, you'll have friends or relationships

367
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.010
that you have built on this level of vibration

368
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.210
and suddenly you are up here,

369
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.610
and it has caused great stress throughout all of humanity,

370
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.660
because this has been the normal way of growing.

371
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.563
And we tell you that that is about to--

372
00:19:43.563 --> 00:19:47.863
you are starting to grow more in unison than ever before.

373
00:19:47.863 --> 00:19:51.413
But this is what is happening as the end of separation

374
00:19:51.413 --> 00:19:54.263
starts to take place on planet Earth.

375
00:19:54.263 --> 00:19:58.463
<v ->You will feel war,</v>

376
00:19:59.923 --> 00:20:02.922
a work will feel like joy,

377
00:20:02.922 --> 00:20:05.272
to you, however you define joy,

378
00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:08.322
it will feel more sincerely,

379
00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:12.028
nourishing, fulfilling,

380
00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:14.778
the joy, the pleasure,

381
00:20:14.778 --> 00:20:17.284
the heartfelt ecstasy,

382
00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:20.896
filled with knowledge, wisdom, intelligence,

383
00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:22.614
we'll feel

384
00:20:22.614 --> 00:20:26.514
soul infinitely

385
00:20:26.514 --> 00:20:31.114
and an ability to support you in feeling more of that,

386
00:20:31.114 --> 00:20:34.514
and you will feel like whatever it is you are doing

387
00:20:34.514 --> 00:20:37.614
in that sensation is the most meaningful thing

388
00:20:37.614 --> 00:20:39.767
you could be doing, because you'll have,

389
00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:42.417
you'll carry a layer of purpose,

390
00:20:43.687 --> 00:20:47.323
the greatest sense of purpose of what you can be offering

391
00:20:47.323 --> 00:20:50.829
and experiencing, for self and for others.

392
00:20:50.829 --> 00:20:54.935
<v ->You will notice that your reality unfolds,</v>

393
00:20:54.935 --> 00:20:57.235
it just does a bum-pe-bum-pe-bum,

394
00:20:57.235 --> 00:20:59.335
linear, step by step by step, okay,

395
00:20:59.335 --> 00:21:01.585
we got step two, now step three.

396
00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:06.135
It doesn't tend to work that way, you see,

397
00:21:06.135 --> 00:21:10.435
and so from a global level, from a group level,

398
00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:14.735
you are all together working towards that oneness,

399
00:21:14.735 --> 00:21:17.685
moving towards that oneness by activating

400
00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:20.235
and energizing your individual lives,

401
00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:22.485
and there will come a time where you will

402
00:21:22.485 --> 00:21:26.585
be able to recognize the network of lights that you are,

403
00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.388
you will be able to more consciously

404
00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:30.088
be aware of those networks.

405
00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:34.738 line:15% 
<v ->We're all, all looking for the same thing.</v>

406
00:21:34.738 --> 00:21:37.918 line:15% 
We are fascinated by this time in your

407
00:21:37.918 --> 00:21:42.138 line:15% 
Earth's growth, your Earth's culture, shall we say.

408
00:21:42.138 --> 00:21:44.221
<v ->Because you're all these amazing beings,</v>

409
00:21:44.221 --> 00:21:46.321
living in this planet together, collectively,

410
00:21:46.321 --> 00:21:47.774
and you chose to be here together.

411
00:21:47.774 --> 00:21:50.074
<v ->And you become one with them,</v>

412
00:21:50.074 --> 00:21:52.077
you, in a sense, merge with them,

413
00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:55.327
while remaining your own, distinct identity.

414
00:21:55.327 --> 00:21:59.780
You will find that you will, when that emerges,

415
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.130
in that coming together, they will come out of it

416
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.280
in a single resonance, a oneness, if you will,

417
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.880
and that oneness is what you work with.

418
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.033
<v ->You are in a state of enhanced creation,</v>

419
00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:18.183
faster, quicker, again, your energy field

420
00:22:18.183 --> 00:22:20.236
is much, much bigger than it was.

421
00:22:20.236 --> 00:22:24.086
<v ->And your life is joyous, magical, and wonderful.</v>

422
00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:26.586
<v ->Be loved by all that is.</v>

423
00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:28.639
You're loving everything and being loved by everything

424
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.742
right now, in every moment, eternally, always have,

425
00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:33.292
always will, whether you choose to allow yourself

426
00:22:33.292 --> 00:22:36.395
to put out the idea, and thus then get back experiences

427
00:22:36.395 --> 00:22:38.995
that confirm it for you or not.

428
00:22:38.995 --> 00:22:41.695
<v ->These are the attributes that you will have.</v>

429
00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:44.095
The fifth dimension, you have put forward,

430
00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:47.695
your enhanced state of creation right now.

431
00:22:47.695 --> 00:22:50.245
What takes place is very simple.

432
00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:52.548
You wake up in the morning, you look in the mirror,

433
00:22:52.548 --> 00:22:54.748
you brush your hair, you brush your teeth,

434
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:56.948
you get ready for work, and you go to work

435
00:22:56.948 --> 00:22:59.248
expecting a third dimensional reality,

436
00:22:59.248 --> 00:23:01.357
and you are in such a state of enhanced creation,

437
00:23:01.357 --> 00:23:03.207
you create the third dimension

438
00:23:03.207 --> 00:23:05.007
inside of the fifth dimension.

439
00:23:05.007 --> 00:23:07.407
<v ->There are many there with you to support you</v>

440
00:23:07.407 --> 00:23:12.307
in the process, in that you only need to ask for yourself,

441
00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:17.307
your higher self, your guides, your spirit angels,

442
00:23:17.357 --> 00:23:21.257
to support you in ways that will be more effortless

443
00:23:21.257 --> 00:23:25.810
and feel, to you, more joyful.

444
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.310
<v ->You all have gifts to give one another,</v>

445
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.519
so sharing that energy between each other,

446
00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:35.669
there's messages to be found

447
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:38.469
in every interaction with one another.

448
00:23:38.469 --> 00:23:41.019
<v ->Explore those differences, do not think you</v>

449
00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:44.319
have to do this overnight, you are doing this

450
00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:47.819
in the timeline of humanity in a blink of an eye, anyway.

451
00:23:47.819 --> 00:23:50.869
When this is looked back on from all of humanity,

452
00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:54.369
this will have happened in a split second.

453
00:23:54.369 --> 00:23:57.169
So take your time, do not rush through this,

454
00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:00.019
allow the acclimation to come through comfortably.

455
00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:04.369
<v ->There are times in all evolutionary history</v>

456
00:24:04.369 --> 00:24:06.669
where there is a greater force of energy.

457
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:09.269
<v ->And so perhaps spirit now has its time.</v>

458
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:13.969
(mystical music)

459
00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:20.472
<v ->Everyone experiences the opposite of who they are,</v>

460
00:24:20.472 --> 00:24:23.672
and in that moment, they have discontent,

461
00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:25.622
because they're not in their heart,

462
00:24:25.622 --> 00:24:29.622
they're in their head, they're not enhancing their ka,

463
00:24:29.622 --> 00:24:33.772
they are stuck, they are discontented,

464
00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:37.472
and divine, yes, because it's all part of the path.

465
00:24:37.472 --> 00:24:41.975
<v ->And yet, we sense that it is most important</v>

466
00:24:41.975 --> 00:24:46.425
that each one stay in loving compassion for self,

467
00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:49.025
throughout difficult times,

468
00:24:49.025 --> 00:24:53.995
and try to see the world through the perspective

469
00:24:53.995 --> 00:24:57.608
of infinite opportunity.

470
00:24:57.608 --> 00:25:02.578
This is an important expansion of thought,

471
00:25:02.578 --> 00:25:06.111
to go outside the box, as they say,

472
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:10.961
to go into your own highest creativity,

473
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:14.561
to expand into your imagination,

474
00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:17.117
and really believe

475
00:25:17.117 --> 00:25:20.517
into the infinite potentiality

476
00:25:20.517 --> 00:25:22.867
of what can be in your reality.

477
00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:25.867
When one takes that expanded viewpoint,

478
00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:28.817
then you open up all kinds of doors

479
00:25:28.817 --> 00:25:31.267
for new things to come into your life.

480
00:25:31.267 --> 00:25:34.770
So we would say that anyone who has

481
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.870
experienced great loss has come here

482
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.570
to master the art of letting go.

483
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.726
<v ->So we say</v>

484
00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:46.726
that everything has a purpose,

485
00:25:46.726 --> 00:25:48.638
and all of this has meaning,

486
00:25:48.638 --> 00:25:51.888
and as you search the tragedies

487
00:25:51.888 --> 00:25:56.238
and the difficult moments, and your reactions to them,

488
00:25:56.238 --> 00:25:59.641
within them are treasures,

489
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:04.344
are treasures filled with purpose and deep meaning,

490
00:26:04.344 --> 00:26:06.950
and as you are able to see

491
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.600
your world reflected before you,

492
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.803
and look at it from that perspective,

493
00:26:14.803 --> 00:26:18.459
not judging those moments

494
00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:21.209
as good or bad,

495
00:26:21.209 --> 00:26:24.109
but observe those moments,

496
00:26:24.109 --> 00:26:27.209
observe the realities that you're creating,

497
00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:31.959
and be able to assess

498
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:38.522
the experience, the meaning behind the experience,

499
00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:42.690
and decide, is this

500
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:47.340
the experience we wish to express?

501
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.943
There's no bad or good, but what do you choose?

502
00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:53.793
You have a choice, and knowing that you have a choice

503
00:26:53.793 --> 00:26:56.646
gives you the power, learning that you have a choice,

504
00:26:56.646 --> 00:26:59.646
recognizing that you have a choice

505
00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:03.349
as to what you experience

506
00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:06.149
and that you are amazingly powerful beings.

507
00:27:07.479 --> 00:27:10.505
<v ->Because if you can remember who you are,</v>

508
00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:13.255
and you can stay plugged into that,

509
00:27:13.255 --> 00:27:15.508
you, too, can have a vaulted perspective,

510
00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:19.308
you can have this exalted perspective.

511
00:27:19.308 --> 00:27:22.414
And from there, you can find your life

512
00:27:22.414 --> 00:27:24.067
becoming much more magical,

513
00:27:24.067 --> 00:27:27.617
much more spiritually unfolding for you.

514
00:27:27.617 --> 00:27:29.320
<v ->They will draw to themselves</v>

515
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.020
a more compassionate adventure.

516
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.070
All things will be slightly more in balance.

517
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.970
Answers to questions will come more quickly.

518
00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.870
That which they seek will find them

519
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.420
at a more opportune moment.

520
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.720
All things are next to each other nicely,

521
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.220
the energies are less chaotic.

522
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.570
<v ->Feeling that the weight of the world</v>

523
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.520
has been lifted from your shoulders,

524
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.770
and that weight was your own weight

525
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.870
that you imposed upon yourself.

526
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.970
<v ->You have, in a sense, as a purpose,</v>

527
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.620
to gather, wanting to explore the idea of life

528
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.573
in a very limited way, you see what that could be like,

529
00:28:10.573 --> 00:28:14.276
to see how much of a sense of the actual infinite pleasure

530
00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:17.326
that is your actual nature could come through,

531
00:28:17.326 --> 00:28:19.826
in a play, in a drama, in a stage,

532
00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:23.776
where you created such limited definitions about yourself,

533
00:28:25.066 --> 00:28:27.229
but it would cause

534
00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:31.432
an unknown experience to come through.

535
00:28:31.432 --> 00:28:35.882
<v ->So that the seed of truth that is already there</v>

536
00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:39.482
becomes more pronounced, more profound,

537
00:28:39.482 --> 00:28:42.882
and, so, more proficient at life, as well,

538
00:28:42.882 --> 00:28:46.282
opportunities proliferate rather than those

539
00:28:46.282 --> 00:28:48.785
that are held here, boxed here, and said,

540
00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:51.485
"This is what you are, this is the highest

541
00:28:51.485 --> 00:28:54.885
"that you can hope for, make the best of it."

542
00:28:54.885 --> 00:28:57.935
And, unfortunately, that is what a great deal

543
00:28:57.935 --> 00:29:01.085
of humanity is told, "There you are,

544
00:29:01.085 --> 00:29:04.085
"that is as good as it's going to get.

545
00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:07.135
"Make the most of it," you see?

546
00:29:07.135 --> 00:29:08.735
<v ->We are here,</v>

547
00:29:08.735 --> 00:29:12.735
at your asking, although you may not be aware of it,

548
00:29:12.735 --> 00:29:15.585
your society as a whole, as a collective consciousness,

549
00:29:15.585 --> 00:29:17.885
has invited us back, in a sense,

550
00:29:17.885 --> 00:29:20.435
that we may, as children of yours,

551
00:29:20.435 --> 00:29:24.435
remind you of the geniuses that you actually are,

552
00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:27.685
the master creators of what you actually are,

553
00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:30.435
that you may regain more awareness of this,

554
00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:34.688
and feel more of this infinite beauty and love

555
00:29:34.688 --> 00:29:37.241
and laughter that is so much more representative

556
00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:39.241
of your actual nature,

557
00:29:39.241 --> 00:29:41.541
who recognize,

558
00:29:41.541 --> 00:29:45.641
first of all, that you all have your own time

559
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:49.047
to work through the old ideas,

560
00:29:49.047 --> 00:29:51.400
to let go of the old belief systems

561
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.950
that are part and parcel creating the fear to begin with.

562
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:57.600
For anything that is a fear

563
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.700
is not representative of your actual nature.

564
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.200
So then, when you begin to recognize

565
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.250
how you created each experience you're having,

566
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.400
what you put out is what you get back,

567
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.203
as you begin to recognize that you're feeling,

568
00:30:12.203 --> 00:30:14.853
if you feel fear, and say,

569
00:30:14.853 --> 00:30:18.003
"Fear isn't my actual nature,

570
00:30:18.003 --> 00:30:20.806
"my actual nature is abundance, infinite value,

571
00:30:20.806 --> 00:30:23.462
"love, support," well, there's nothing

572
00:30:23.462 --> 00:30:25.412
to fear in that state of being.

573
00:30:25.412 --> 00:30:27.112
<v ->In the first wave of power,</v>

574
00:30:27.112 --> 00:30:29.812
in the very beginnings of all of humanity,

575
00:30:29.812 --> 00:30:34.812
you used fear, it was your great movement,

576
00:30:34.812 --> 00:30:37.012
it was the great lack,

577
00:30:37.012 --> 00:30:39.562
and that was your main motivation.

578
00:30:39.562 --> 00:30:41.812
Fear was the main motivation,

579
00:30:41.812 --> 00:30:45.012
and survival was the main motivation on this planet.

580
00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:47.562
Fear of survival was number one.

581
00:30:47.562 --> 00:30:51.162
And now, people are not as afraid.

582
00:30:52.472 --> 00:30:56.365
<v ->Look at how many people are awakening,</v>

583
00:30:57.595 --> 00:31:00.468
just because of the fear.

584
00:31:00.468 --> 00:31:04.518
Look at how many people are panicking

585
00:31:04.518 --> 00:31:07.468
just because of the fear.

586
00:31:07.468 --> 00:31:09.574
The awakening

587
00:31:12.114 --> 00:31:15.027
is overtaking the panicking.

588
00:31:15.027 --> 00:31:17.627
<v ->Yes, it very important to have,</v>

589
00:31:17.627 --> 00:31:20.277
to reach the levels of divine discontent,

590
00:31:20.277 --> 00:31:22.680
it has happened many times on this planet,

591
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.930
and will continue, to where,

592
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.236
a point where people cannot take any more,

593
00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:28.736
they have to speak out,

594
00:31:28.736 --> 00:31:31.336
but you understand what is taking place,

595
00:31:31.336 --> 00:31:33.836
it is different now than ever before.

596
00:31:33.836 --> 00:31:36.936
<v ->With that said, we understand</v>

597
00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:39.336
that there have been many people

598
00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:42.336
that have lost large fortunes,

599
00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:44.836
they have lost their life savings,

600
00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.736
they have lost their retirements,

601
00:31:46.736 --> 00:31:48.436
they have lost their homes,

602
00:31:48.436 --> 00:31:52.286
and they say, "Well, it's a real reality,

603
00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:55.236
"it's not my negative thinking that created this,

604
00:31:55.236 --> 00:31:56.986
"it's just the harsh reality

605
00:31:56.986 --> 00:32:01.895
"of life that's created this financial devastation."

606
00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:04.748
<v ->It is only necessary if they are choosing</v>

607
00:32:04.748 --> 00:32:07.498
to define their reality in that way,

608
00:32:07.498 --> 00:32:10.148
if, for their own reasons, they feel

609
00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:13.298
that is what they experience, they prefer to have,

610
00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:17.248
translates as an experience of physical reality,

611
00:32:18.968 --> 00:32:22.304
so that it isn't actually necessary,

612
00:32:22.304 --> 00:32:26.504
but it is something that they wanted to explore, that idea,

613
00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:29.804
for their own reason, something about

614
00:32:29.804 --> 00:32:32.407
was, in terms of how in those moments,

615
00:32:32.407 --> 00:32:34.710
they were defining themselves,

616
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.663
it seemed like the most pleasurable choice,

617
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:39.363
and the least painful choice to make.

618
00:32:39.363 --> 00:32:43.563
<v ->Humanity believes in this possibility of destruction</v>

619
00:32:43.563 --> 00:32:46.613
because, in many lives and schemes,

620
00:32:46.613 --> 00:32:50.513
it has undergone cataclysmic change,

621
00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:53.763
which very much appears to be destruction,

622
00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:57.313
it very much appears to be endings and beginnings,

623
00:32:57.313 --> 00:33:01.366
but they are simply renewals, cycles of renewal and change

624
00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:05.566
and making and remaking, so it is humanity's belief

625
00:33:06.922 --> 00:33:11.272
in pivotal endings that perpetuates this idea,

626
00:33:11.272 --> 00:33:13.022
it is not a Gaian idea.

627
00:33:14.552 --> 00:33:17.878
<v ->And the potential is there for you to rise above that</v>

628
00:33:17.878 --> 00:33:21.978
and transform all of these difficulties and all of these

629
00:33:21.978 --> 00:33:25.928
old systems and do something incredibly amazing and new.

630
00:33:25.928 --> 00:33:29.378
<v ->It is difficult for many who are wrapped up</v>

631
00:33:29.378 --> 00:33:32.528
in the midst of it, you are in one of these balloons

632
00:33:32.528 --> 00:33:37.028
and the balloon burst, there is nothing holding you up,

633
00:33:37.028 --> 00:33:39.778
there is no security, you will fall.

634
00:33:39.778 --> 00:33:41.834
But will you really be hurt?

635
00:33:41.834 --> 00:33:43.434
That is the question.

636
00:33:43.434 --> 00:33:47.634
(mystical music)

637
00:33:52.387 --> 00:33:54.443
<v ->The role of ego is very important</v>

638
00:33:54.443 --> 00:33:56.493
for the evolution of your species.

639
00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:59.193
It was your self-recognition.

640
00:34:00.693 --> 00:34:03.502
It was, "I am me, and here I am,

641
00:34:03.502 --> 00:34:06.202
"and I am conscious of who I am,

642
00:34:06.202 --> 00:34:08.102
"and I am separate from you."

643
00:34:08.102 --> 00:34:11.152
And you experienced the separation

644
00:34:11.152 --> 00:34:15.452
in order to understand your own individuality.

645
00:34:15.452 --> 00:34:17.704
<v ->The ego has grown, the ego, you have had</v>

646
00:34:17.704 --> 00:34:19.861
all kinds of fun with, and all kinds

647
00:34:19.861 --> 00:34:22.105
of wonderful difficulties with.

648
00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:23.821
It has helped you learn many,

649
00:34:23.821 --> 00:34:26.065
many lessons throughout your life.

650
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:28.397
<v ->And you all need an ego,</v>

651
00:34:28.397 --> 00:34:32.445
it's an essential part of survival on this planet.

652
00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:37.445
<v ->And this is a natural survivalistic part of the human self</v>

653
00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:41.439
as even the beginnings

654
00:34:41.439 --> 00:34:44.797
of life needed to determine

655
00:34:46.247 --> 00:34:49.741
what supports life and that which does not support life.

656
00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:52.561
So there's a survivalistic part of the ego

657
00:34:52.561 --> 00:34:55.137
that's just always on the lookout for

658
00:34:56.747 --> 00:35:00.847
what is in its highest good and what isn't.

659
00:35:00.847 --> 00:35:04.251
<v ->And so, to begin to consult the knower,</v>

660
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:08.345
rather than the known, invites a greater possibility

661
00:35:08.345 --> 00:35:12.991
and begins to transfer energy from the lower to the higher,

662
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:16.625
and so more possibilities, a little bit silence,

663
00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:19.477
a moment to observe the truth,

664
00:35:19.477 --> 00:35:23.433
a moment to observe the truth becoming more truthful,

665
00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:27.527
to give life an expression to that higher truth,

666
00:35:27.527 --> 00:35:30.563
to that self, by observing that self.

667
00:35:30.563 --> 00:35:33.119
<v ->So it can be a push-pull of</v>

668
00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:36.595
what is right or wrong within oneself.

669
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:40.761
Now the ego, therefore, can drive one

670
00:35:40.761 --> 00:35:44.421
to behaviors that may or may not be

671
00:35:44.421 --> 00:35:48.975
in alignment with one's greatest potentialities,

672
00:35:48.975 --> 00:35:52.931
so the easiest way to transcend the ego

673
00:35:52.931 --> 00:35:55.211
is to just begin looking at,

674
00:35:55.211 --> 00:35:58.365
what are your internal motivations

675
00:35:58.365 --> 00:36:01.401
for everything that you're doing in life?

676
00:36:01.401 --> 00:36:04.253
In other words, are there ego payoffs?

677
00:36:04.253 --> 00:36:08.557
Ego payoffs or emotional payoffs are when

678
00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:12.007
you get a little, what do they say, juice,

679
00:36:12.007 --> 00:36:16.639
or you get a little of happy buzz,

680
00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:21.469
because someone just paid you a compliment,

681
00:36:21.469 --> 00:36:24.025
so the ego fishes for compliments, you know,

682
00:36:24.025 --> 00:36:27.843
so there's these kinds of behaviors that evolve

683
00:36:27.843 --> 00:36:29.729
that are often unconscious.

684
00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:33.915
<v ->You are taught that in order to find the answers</v>

685
00:36:33.915 --> 00:36:38.147
to life's problems, they are found in your head,

686
00:36:38.147 --> 00:36:40.033
you are taught that in your school system.

687
00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:43.529
And so, through your childhood,

688
00:36:43.529 --> 00:36:47.327
you become more and more ego-invested,

689
00:36:47.327 --> 00:36:50.501
and then there comes a time in your life

690
00:36:50.501 --> 00:36:54.391
when it doesn't feel so good to be in your ego,

691
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:56.875
you discover your heart,

692
00:36:56.875 --> 00:37:00.095
and you make the transition back

693
00:37:00.095 --> 00:37:02.625
to this heart-center being, this--

694
00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:06.857
you lead with your soul, instead of leading with your head,

695
00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:09.183
you lead with your ka, as we like to say.

696
00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:11.713
<v ->In this very moment, you can withdraw,</v>

697
00:37:11.713 --> 00:37:15.485
just enough to observe yourself and see,

698
00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:17.647
there it is, that is my body,

699
00:37:17.647 --> 00:37:20.453
there I am, conversing in this moment,

700
00:37:20.453 --> 00:37:22.753
and that is the lower nature,

701
00:37:22.753 --> 00:37:25.237
or the personality that is doing that.

702
00:37:25.237 --> 00:37:28.069
<v ->It is not time to entirely demolish</v>

703
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:31.565
your ego identity, but not to allow it

704
00:37:31.565 --> 00:37:34.647
to have control over your soul.

705
00:37:34.647 --> 00:37:37.663
Your soul should have control

706
00:37:37.663 --> 00:37:40.541
over your individual identity.

707
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:43.577
And that soul understands that it's connected

708
00:37:43.577 --> 00:37:47.099
to every being in the universe.

709
00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:49.287
<v ->I say to you, if you will</v>

710
00:37:49.287 --> 00:37:52.001
observe the self but for a moment,

711
00:37:52.001 --> 00:37:55.911
you will see that the next words spoken by that self

712
00:37:55.911 --> 00:37:59.223
will be softer, will be less words,

713
00:37:59.223 --> 00:38:02.719
will be more purposeful, will have higher intention

714
00:38:02.719 --> 00:38:07.319
and will yield higher results, so it is a mindful practice.

715
00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:11.715
<v ->As soon as you do that, everything starts to shift.</v>

716
00:38:12.965 --> 00:38:15.585
Issues start to dissolve,

717
00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:18.851
or they start morphing into other aspects.

718
00:38:18.851 --> 00:38:21.775
<v ->As you continue to grow, as you evolve,</v>

719
00:38:21.775 --> 00:38:25.593
the ego has to be balanced, and that

720
00:38:25.593 --> 00:38:28.885
is the biggest challenge that you will experience now.

721
00:38:28.885 --> 00:38:31.461
There are many ways, and all of you know

722
00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:33.807
what happens when an ego gets too big,

723
00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:36.613
you cut yourself off from your source.

724
00:38:36.613 --> 00:38:39.143
But we also tell you that you need ego,

725
00:38:39.143 --> 00:38:41.147
and many of you do not have enough ego

726
00:38:41.147 --> 00:38:43.769
to stand up and say, "I have something of value."

727
00:38:43.769 --> 00:38:46.897
And everyone misses out, so it's a balance,

728
00:38:46.897 --> 00:38:49.979
about knowing who you are inside

729
00:38:49.979 --> 00:38:52.969
and letting that light shine, without thinking

730
00:38:52.969 --> 00:38:54.763
that you are the only one, I get it,

731
00:38:54.763 --> 00:38:57.825
it's about making space for the other gods.

732
00:38:57.825 --> 00:39:02.287 line:15% 
(mystical music)

733
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:17.473
<v ->The law of attraction is but one law.</v>

734
00:39:17.473 --> 00:39:21.015
It is but one law in the universal sense.

735
00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:23.177
A universal law is that which applies

736
00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:27.041
to all things, all beings, equally,

737
00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:28.835
equally in all directions,

738
00:39:28.835 --> 00:39:31.227
equally in all places in the universe,

739
00:39:31.227 --> 00:39:34.677
that is what makes it a universal law.

740
00:39:34.677 --> 00:39:37.713
The law of attraction, being one of these,

741
00:39:37.713 --> 00:39:41.485
must be lived within the context of the other laws.

742
00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:44.337
If one will study universal law,

743
00:39:44.337 --> 00:39:46.913
then one becomes immersed

744
00:39:46.913 --> 00:39:51.913
in the principles of truth that uphold universal law.

745
00:39:52.065 --> 00:39:54.733
Now, from these, the law of attraction,

746
00:39:54.733 --> 00:39:57.143
being one that will draw

747
00:39:57.143 --> 00:40:00.431
to one what is in highest accord,

748
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.413
what is in the highest thought,

749
00:40:02.413 --> 00:40:04.575
what is in the greatest potential,

750
00:40:04.575 --> 00:40:07.335
and by acknowledging that law,

751
00:40:07.335 --> 00:40:11.935
one is raised into the awareness of that law,

752
00:40:11.935 --> 00:40:13.959
so that the person, the being,

753
00:40:13.959 --> 00:40:16.167
and their thought, and the law,

754
00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:18.743
and what it brings, become one.

755
00:40:18.743 --> 00:40:21.871
That is the true law of attraction.

756
00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:25.321
It is not simply getting one's way in life.

757
00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:27.989
<v ->Our idea of magnetism, and we believe what</v>

758
00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:31.209
human scientists will find out in the next hundred years,

759
00:40:31.209 --> 00:40:35.349
is that magnetism basically runs this planet,

760
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:38.917
and you are electromagnetic beings.

761
00:40:38.917 --> 00:40:40.895
You can know that, you've seen that,

762
00:40:40.895 --> 00:40:42.459
your own scientists know,

763
00:40:42.459 --> 00:40:44.207
wherever there is an electrical current,

764
00:40:44.207 --> 00:40:46.553
there is also a magnetic field.

765
00:40:46.553 --> 00:40:49.957
Your body is filled with magnetic currents.

766
00:40:49.957 --> 00:40:53.407
This place up here creates and transmits

767
00:40:53.407 --> 00:40:55.917
very subtle magnetic fields.

768
00:40:55.917 --> 00:40:59.551
And when it does, it becomes the field of precedure,

769
00:40:59.551 --> 00:41:02.113
it preceeds you before you make the phone call,

770
00:41:02.113 --> 00:41:03.947
before you walk in the room,

771
00:41:03.947 --> 00:41:07.245
it's the energy field that precedes you and goes out

772
00:41:07.245 --> 00:41:10.419
into the universe, away from your physical body.

773
00:41:10.419 --> 00:41:11.937
You are going to learn how

774
00:41:11.937 --> 00:41:15.663
to extend that magnetic field greatly,

775
00:41:15.663 --> 00:41:17.549
you will learn how to use it,

776
00:41:17.549 --> 00:41:19.389
you will learn how to work with it,

777
00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:21.735
for it is how you create everything,

778
00:41:21.735 --> 00:41:25.461
and when you put a thought, which is magnetic,

779
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:28.681
when you put a thought into that field,

780
00:41:28.681 --> 00:41:32.959
it automatically draws to it other things of similar nature,

781
00:41:32.959 --> 00:41:36.041
and that is the law of attraction, it is very simple.

782
00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:40.273
<v ->Why would there be a life that seems somewhat difficult?</v>

783
00:41:40.273 --> 00:41:44.137
Why would they choose to enter that lifestream?

784
00:41:44.137 --> 00:41:46.345
<v ->Again, an excellent question about--</v>

785
00:41:47.925 --> 00:41:51.549
being your reality and how your beliefs

786
00:41:51.549 --> 00:41:54.499
affect what you create,

787
00:41:55.879 --> 00:41:59.355
because this is key to your creation.

788
00:41:59.355 --> 00:42:02.049
You are formulated

789
00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:05.315
as a being by those beliefs.

790
00:42:05.315 --> 00:42:08.075
And it is all in your consciousness.

791
00:42:08.075 --> 00:42:11.755
None of it was real,

792
00:42:11.755 --> 00:42:14.147
it was all your creation,

793
00:42:14.147 --> 00:42:16.079
and how you reacted to it,

794
00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:18.727
and how you continue to react to it.

795
00:42:18.727 --> 00:42:20.751
So what were they telling you?

796
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:22.729
What were your stories telling you?

797
00:42:24.299 --> 00:42:28.695
Why did you create a story that made you feel inferior?

798
00:42:30.035 --> 00:42:33.209
That made you feel sad, or abused?

799
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.251
Why were you doing that?

800
00:42:36.251 --> 00:42:38.873
You created these victim environments so that you

801
00:42:38.873 --> 00:42:41.679
could realize that you're not a victim, believe it or not,

802
00:42:41.679 --> 00:42:44.209
because there's no such thing as victimhood,

803
00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:46.259
that was your creation, why did you create it?

804
00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:48.237
Look at it, it was a beautiful creation,

805
00:42:48.237 --> 00:42:51.089
now I can realize that I am the one

806
00:42:51.089 --> 00:42:54.631
that created myself as a victim, I have the power.

807
00:42:54.631 --> 00:42:57.437
When you recognize that it was your energy

808
00:42:57.437 --> 00:43:00.105
that created that in one way or another,

809
00:43:01.495 --> 00:43:04.665
when you recognize that and take responsibility for that,

810
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:09.127
the power that external influence has dissolves.

811
00:43:10.507 --> 00:43:14.765
Just try it, try and take responsibility, and you will see.

812
00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:19.043
<v ->These changes are subtle, but they are lifelong.</v>

813
00:43:19.043 --> 00:43:21.251
One who understands true wealth

814
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:25.897
understands the value of life, and the law of attraction,

815
00:43:25.897 --> 00:43:29.485
and will never be without, for that one does not think

816
00:43:29.485 --> 00:43:34.453
of how much one has, and how to hold onto it or multiply it.

817
00:43:34.453 --> 00:43:39.415
And so one can accumulate monies, or material possessions,

818
00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:42.777
but they do not bring true happiness.

819
00:43:42.777 --> 00:43:45.169
That is why humanity goes in search of the next

820
00:43:45.169 --> 00:43:47.975
and the next happy moment,

821
00:43:47.975 --> 00:43:50.597
and it is not that they are not worthwhile,

822
00:43:50.597 --> 00:43:53.357
it is simply that it is not wealth,

823
00:43:53.357 --> 00:43:57.175
it is money management, it is accumulation,

824
00:43:57.175 --> 00:44:00.533
and so one draws to oneself true wealth

825
00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:03.845
by valuing life and all that is--

826
00:44:06.955 --> 00:44:10.731
gather in life, those who gather with ideas

827
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:15.239
and creativities by nurturing the creative awareness

828
00:44:15.239 --> 00:44:17.447
and valuing that, you see,

829
00:44:17.447 --> 00:44:20.529
creativity is that which multiplies,

830
00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:23.749
but for the most part, humanity has forgotten

831
00:44:23.749 --> 00:44:27.889
what true creativity is, and so a creative project

832
00:44:27.889 --> 00:44:32.535
is seen as one that is viable, as one that can be created,

833
00:44:32.535 --> 00:44:35.663
as one that can be inserted into the economy,

834
00:44:35.663 --> 00:44:39.159
as one that can be bought or sold or traded.

835
00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:42.103
And so in understanding true value,

836
00:44:42.103 --> 00:44:45.027
a new system of value

837
00:44:45.027 --> 00:44:47.767
will elevate all things.

838
00:44:47.767 --> 00:44:52.321
Now, in your time, the economy is devaluing itself.

839
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:53.793
Why?

840
00:44:53.793 --> 00:44:56.467
All around the world, that is so.

841
00:44:56.467 --> 00:44:58.675
It seems as if it is simply

842
00:44:58.675 --> 00:45:01.987
for the poor practices of the banking communities

843
00:45:01.987 --> 00:45:05.851
and all of the other systems, but it is not simply that.

844
00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:09.347
The value of the human being has fallen,

845
00:45:09.347 --> 00:45:13.717
the value of true creativity is on the floor,

846
00:45:13.717 --> 00:45:17.377
and so the value of money follows that,

847
00:45:17.377 --> 00:45:19.111
not the other way round.

848
00:45:20.815 --> 00:45:23.507
Not it is not simply value in itself,

849
00:45:23.507 --> 00:45:27.325
it is to value life, to uphold life,

850
00:45:27.325 --> 00:45:32.305
life for the sake of living, life for the sake of light,

851
00:45:32.305 --> 00:45:36.295
life for the purpose of discovery,

852
00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:39.055
to value that, to uplift that,

853
00:45:39.055 --> 00:45:43.149
you will see, not only will it uplift a few spirits, it will

854
00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:46.309
lift the dollars from the floor as well, I assure you.

855
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:48.957
<v ->But where is the intention behind the goals?</v>

856
00:45:48.957 --> 00:45:51.395
Again, intention, intention.

857
00:45:51.395 --> 00:45:53.281
Where is your consciousness?

858
00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:57.841
<v ->In order to truly draw to oneself, attract to oneself,</v>

859
00:45:57.841 --> 00:46:02.073
one must understand and uphold all of the laws.

860
00:46:02.073 --> 00:46:05.477
One cannot exclude the other laws

861
00:46:05.477 --> 00:46:08.789
and simply concentrate on the law of attraction.

862
00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:12.837
One must uphold the principles, one must live a true life,

863
00:46:12.837 --> 00:46:15.459
one that is committed consciousness.

864
00:46:15.459 --> 00:46:19.599
This is what brings evolution, this is what draws ascension,

865
00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:22.819
one elevates oneself within these laws,

866
00:46:22.819 --> 00:46:25.257
upholding and living principles, you see,

867
00:46:25.257 --> 00:46:28.063
if one lives only by man's laws,

868
00:46:28.063 --> 00:46:29.811
then that is a lower form of law,

869
00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:31.447
and yes, one must abide by these,

870
00:46:31.447 --> 00:46:33.701
obey them, as the case may be,

871
00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:36.441
but the higher laws, one must embody them,

872
00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:38.741
one must choose them.

873
00:46:38.741 --> 00:46:42.835
It is not the same as "must do," one chooses the law,

874
00:46:42.835 --> 00:46:45.411
and so the law responds.

875
00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:49.623
<v ->So, go ahead and create the million dollars,</v>

876
00:46:49.623 --> 00:46:53.059
and, in any moment, as a technique

877
00:46:53.059 --> 00:46:55.109
to begin to more fully understand

878
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:57.041
what it is you're putting out,

879
00:46:57.041 --> 00:47:00.083
just allow your ego mind, your physical mind,

880
00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:03.349
to take in, experience what it is

881
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:05.787
you are experiencing, your reality.

882
00:47:05.787 --> 00:47:07.995
Whatever you are experiencing

883
00:47:07.995 --> 00:47:10.847
is a result of what you have been putting out.

884
00:47:12.407 --> 00:47:14.743
Everything you are getting back is a result

885
00:47:14.743 --> 00:47:18.423
of what you are putting out.

886
00:47:18.423 --> 00:47:22.773
You are that powerful, to create all of this reality

887
00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:26.821
that is coming back to you, you are that powerful.

888
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.179
You are that being that is capable

889
00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:34.825
of generating this whole reality at every moment,

890
00:47:34.825 --> 00:47:39.195
every detailed aspect of it without exception,

891
00:47:39.195 --> 00:47:43.841
you are an absolute masterful creator.

892
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:47.525
<v ->And when you're in that place, owning your power,</v>

893
00:47:47.525 --> 00:47:49.759
you make choices that change things.

894
00:47:49.759 --> 00:47:52.545
Now, also, things get feedback to you,

895
00:47:52.545 --> 00:47:54.983
magic happens to you, synchronicities happen,

896
00:47:54.983 --> 00:47:57.283
wonderful things happen to you.

897
00:47:57.283 --> 00:48:01.357
<v ->And you will allow what it is that is need to come to you.</v>

898
00:48:02.817 --> 00:48:06.213
You will be attracting it from that perspective,

899
00:48:06.213 --> 00:48:08.861
and then, if you want a million dollars

900
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:10.759
and you want to have fun,

901
00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:14.025
you can do so,

902
00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:16.601
there is nothing stopping you but your own self.

903
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:20.905
And you have so much tied to your expression

904
00:48:20.905 --> 00:48:23.297
and understanding of money

905
00:48:23.297 --> 00:48:26.049
and material possessions that go along with it,

906
00:48:26.049 --> 00:48:29.591
and that is all related to your identity.

907
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:34.125
So you must be able to break through

908
00:48:34.125 --> 00:48:37.141
your own imposed limitations.

909
00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:42.089
<v ->The soul has a compelling, a desire to--</v>

910
00:48:43.489 --> 00:48:46.419
it's an energy that compells one to go forward

911
00:48:46.419 --> 00:48:49.777
in the direction the soul wants them to go.

912
00:48:49.777 --> 00:48:51.985
In other words, everyone comes

913
00:48:51.985 --> 00:48:55.297
into this life with potentialities.

914
00:48:55.297 --> 00:48:59.883
Those who align themselves

915
00:48:59.883 --> 00:49:04.049
with a soul-level desire,

916
00:49:04.049 --> 00:49:08.097
let's say, it's a desire to be an artist,

917
00:49:08.097 --> 00:49:11.823
a desire to be in service to humanity,

918
00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:13.893
those are the higher level desires

919
00:49:13.893 --> 00:49:16.883
that can compel one to live in the fullness

920
00:49:16.883 --> 00:49:20.011
of your own greatest potentialities.

921
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:23.921
And so, desires serve different purposes,

922
00:49:23.921 --> 00:49:25.807
depending on whether they're lower

923
00:49:25.807 --> 00:49:28.409
or higher vibrational desires.

924
00:49:28.409 --> 00:49:31.399
So, of course, we encourage

925
00:49:31.399 --> 00:49:34.369
people to have self-awareness.

926
00:49:34.369 --> 00:49:37.819
<v ->If you remember that the reason you came</v>

927
00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:40.809
was to enhance your soul qualities,

928
00:49:40.809 --> 00:49:45.363
and that every moment is an opportunity,

929
00:49:46.873 --> 00:49:50.731
is a choice, every moment you have a choice

930
00:49:50.731 --> 00:49:53.675
between fear and faith, every moment,

931
00:49:53.675 --> 00:49:58.505
and when you choose faith, you choose the adventure,

932
00:49:58.505 --> 00:50:01.684
you choose peace and joy

933
00:50:01.684 --> 00:50:04.536
and passion and compassion,

934
00:50:04.536 --> 00:50:06.724
then you have created

935
00:50:06.724 --> 00:50:10.498
what you long for in this life, do you not?

936
00:50:10.498 --> 00:50:12.192
You long for that.

937
00:50:13.664 --> 00:50:18.566
It doesn't come to you, you create it through your choices.

938
00:50:18.566 --> 00:50:20.958
<v ->And this is a process of awakening</v>

939
00:50:20.958 --> 00:50:23.580
to what you already are, the power that you already have,

940
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.602
and that you're here to express,

941
00:50:25.602 --> 00:50:28.638
a part of what you already are.

942
00:50:28.638 --> 00:50:31.548
You already are there, there is no there to go to.

943
00:50:33.112 --> 00:50:36.516
So it is key that you understand

944
00:50:38.006 --> 00:50:41.464
where your frequency is in intending

945
00:50:41.464 --> 00:50:44.296
the experiences and objects that you

946
00:50:44.296 --> 00:50:46.208
attract to you in your life.

947
00:50:48.808 --> 00:50:51.638
We cannot stress this enough,

948
00:50:51.638 --> 00:50:55.088
but the concept of desire is very important,

949
00:50:55.088 --> 00:50:59.552
because without desire, you go nowhere.

950
00:50:59.552 --> 00:51:02.956
It is inherent in your being to desire.

951
00:51:04.516 --> 00:51:08.814 line:15% 
(mystical music)

952
00:51:14.142 --> 00:51:17.004
The idea of soulmates.

953
00:51:17.004 --> 00:51:20.412
Well, firstly, you must understand that you are all one,

954
00:51:20.412 --> 00:51:22.482
so you are all soulmates.

955
00:51:24.012 --> 00:51:25.638
However,

956
00:51:25.638 --> 00:51:29.226
there are groups of souls

957
00:51:29.226 --> 00:51:31.690
that have chosen to express themselves

958
00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:35.098
in certain ways, within certain systems,

959
00:51:36.674 --> 00:51:41.334
and they join one another in their lives,

960
00:51:41.334 --> 00:51:44.284
but they are connected,

961
00:51:44.284 --> 00:51:48.286
they are actually a part of the same soul.

962
00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:53.222
So I suppose we could use the analogy

963
00:51:53.222 --> 00:51:56.808
of your body system,

964
00:51:56.808 --> 00:52:00.030
where you have all your cells in your body,

965
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:03.434
and then some cells group up together

966
00:52:03.434 --> 00:52:05.896
and make certain organs,

967
00:52:05.896 --> 00:52:09.068
and all these organs group up together

968
00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:13.392
and make your complete system.

969
00:52:13.392 --> 00:52:16.092
And, as you see,

970
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:19.766
you are all individual cells

971
00:52:19.766 --> 00:52:22.296
that are part of a larger soul system.

972
00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:25.982
So within you are, altogether,

973
00:52:25.982 --> 00:52:28.558
you are the body of the universe.

974
00:52:28.558 --> 00:52:31.228
But then, within that, you have chosen

975
00:52:31.228 --> 00:52:35.738
to express yourselves as individual beings

976
00:52:35.738 --> 00:52:38.174
and groups of beings,

977
00:52:38.174 --> 00:52:41.308
and you consider these soulmates.

978
00:52:42.596 --> 00:52:46.232
You have chosen to incarnate as together,

979
00:52:47.452 --> 00:52:50.446
and you often have similar missions,

980
00:52:52.056 --> 00:52:55.392
your intentions as expressions of the universe

981
00:52:55.392 --> 00:52:58.552
and expressions of creations, are similar.

982
00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:02.140
So you join together

983
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.632
and you become

984
00:53:04.632 --> 00:53:08.034
a greater force in your own evolution,

985
00:53:08.034 --> 00:53:10.888
and the evolution of the greater whole,

986
00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:13.280
just like the organs in the body,

987
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.854
each have their role to play

988
00:53:17.124 --> 00:53:20.160
in allowing your body to move about.

989
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:26.954
So each individual cell and groups of cells,

990
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:30.312
as your individual souls and groups of souls,

991
00:53:30.312 --> 00:53:33.256
have purposes and meaning in expressing

992
00:53:34.836 --> 00:53:39.372
the larger picture of your being, of creation.

993
00:53:40.612 --> 00:53:43.746
<v ->Now, as humans, there are many times</v>

994
00:53:43.746 --> 00:53:46.186
that you make specific contracts,

995
00:53:46.186 --> 00:53:49.498
and many times, these are things that you want to complete,

996
00:53:49.498 --> 00:53:51.982
or have something incomplete,

997
00:53:51.982 --> 00:53:54.558
and even though karma is not controlling

998
00:53:54.558 --> 00:53:56.858
the planet the way it used to,

999
00:53:56.858 --> 00:53:58.604
even though it has been releasd,

1000
00:53:58.604 --> 00:54:01.496
many times, it is actually reviewed for potentials

1001
00:54:01.496 --> 00:54:03.610
and potential contracts and things

1002
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.866
that you can work with and learn.

1003
00:54:05.866 --> 00:54:08.744
So there are still karmic relationships,

1004
00:54:08.744 --> 00:54:10.770
as a result, on the planet.

1005
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.210
The difference is, now, when karmic relationships

1006
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:16.016
come together, the karma is done very, very quickly,

1007
00:54:16.016 --> 00:54:18.480
and if the relationship remains after that,

1008
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.068
they can build it, and if not, they go their separate ways.

1009
00:54:22.068 --> 00:54:25.932
And it's quick, it doesn't take 30 years anymore.

1010
00:54:25.932 --> 00:54:29.428
So you will find a lot of changes going on in these ways.

1011
00:54:29.428 --> 00:54:31.796
As far as specific soul mates?

1012
00:54:31.796 --> 00:54:36.030
No, we do not believe there is only one person for you.

1013
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:39.020
There are many, and if for some reason,

1014
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.412
since you are on the planet of free choice,

1015
00:54:41.412 --> 00:54:44.032
if for some reason you come up to this contract

1016
00:54:44.032 --> 00:54:47.970
that meant so much to you, and they choose opposite,

1017
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:51.374
or they're in another relationship, or whatever happens,

1018
00:54:51.374 --> 00:54:54.710
what takes place is that if it's important,

1019
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.610
it will come around and have another chance to it,

1020
00:54:57.610 --> 00:54:59.726
another opportunity, and sometimes

1021
00:54:59.726 --> 00:55:02.302
two or three backup plans will take place.

1022
00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:04.650
<v ->But, you see, as I have said, humanity does not</v>

1023
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.708
truly understand the true concept of love,

1024
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:10.976
or how unlimited in scope it is.

1025
00:55:10.976 --> 00:55:14.154
True love is simply allowance of all things

1026
00:55:14.154 --> 00:55:16.916
to be as they are in that moment

1027
00:55:16.916 --> 00:55:19.676
and as they may not in the next moment.

1028
00:55:19.676 --> 00:55:24.092
It is unlimited, and so to choose love

1029
00:55:24.092 --> 00:55:27.174
is to choose the moment as it is.

1030
00:55:27.174 --> 00:55:30.716
It is to allow it to unfold within the consciousness

1031
00:55:30.716 --> 00:55:34.534
and knowledge, the greater scope of being.

1032
00:55:34.534 --> 00:55:38.490
It is a lightness of being, it is not love,

1033
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.296
as you think of love towards another,

1034
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:44.240
it is the true compassion for all things

1035
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.966
in their present form, and the understanding

1036
00:55:47.966 --> 00:55:52.656
that they have another form in formlessness, as well,

1037
00:55:52.656 --> 00:55:57.580
so it unites the polarities, it dismissed the lesser truth,

1038
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.134
it brings more possibilities into probabilities,

1039
00:56:02.134 --> 00:56:04.342
it creates wholeness.

1040
00:56:05.572 --> 00:56:09.114
<v ->Finding your own soul</v>

1041
00:56:09.114 --> 00:56:12.908
and loving and nourishing

1042
00:56:12.908 --> 00:56:15.972
and soothing your own soul

1043
00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:20.068
is if you like the word, the secret,

1044
00:56:20.068 --> 00:56:23.656
and then once you have learned how to do that,

1045
00:56:23.656 --> 00:56:27.478
then it's much easier

1046
00:56:27.478 --> 00:56:31.002
to attract a person who has also done that,

1047
00:56:31.002 --> 00:56:33.214
and then it's easy, the relationship is easy,

1048
00:56:33.214 --> 00:56:35.492
and people call it a soulmate.

1049
00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.608
Actually, what's happened is you have

1050
00:56:37.608 --> 00:56:40.274
found your soul, that person has found their soul,

1051
00:56:40.274 --> 00:56:42.160
and so then it's easier for you.

1052
00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.028
<v ->Often, the case is</v>

1053
00:56:48.794 --> 00:56:53.790
that one soul that is upon this planet

1054
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.720
doesn't find their soulmate,

1055
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.998
or a soulmate, that they live an entire life with,

1056
00:57:05.598 --> 00:57:06.826
because

1057
00:57:08.346 --> 00:57:10.276
they're not ready to do so,

1058
00:57:11.666 --> 00:57:14.210
or the other is not ready to do so,

1059
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.516
but that is to say that

1060
00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:18.860
they are affecting one another,

1061
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:22.196
whether they are together or not.

1062
00:57:23.856 --> 00:57:27.466
And some of you had the intention

1063
00:57:27.466 --> 00:57:29.766
before arriving on this planet

1064
00:57:29.766 --> 00:57:32.388
to meet up with each other,

1065
00:57:33.728 --> 00:57:35.800
and you

1066
00:57:37.318 --> 00:57:40.722
have planned, in a sense,

1067
00:57:40.722 --> 00:57:44.104
to allow for the synchronicity that would make that happen,

1068
00:57:44.104 --> 00:57:45.336
but mind you,

1069
00:57:46.944 --> 00:57:48.948
you always have free will.

1070
00:57:50.698 --> 00:57:53.318
So, if one of you goes the other way,

1071
00:57:55.088 --> 00:57:57.964
that fateful day,

1072
00:57:57.964 --> 00:58:01.046
then you will miss one another.

1073
00:58:01.046 --> 00:58:05.048
So this goes back to the idea

1074
00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:07.256
of being connected with your soul,

1075
00:58:07.256 --> 00:58:09.142
because the more you are,

1076
00:58:10.402 --> 00:58:13.422
and the more you free yourself from the confines

1077
00:58:13.422 --> 00:58:15.768
of your identity and projecting that

1078
00:58:15.768 --> 00:58:19.080
the expectations of what it is that you want to be

1079
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.254
and have, including other people in your life,

1080
00:58:23.544 --> 00:58:26.052
the more you can let go of that,

1081
00:58:27.292 --> 00:58:31.030
the more opportunity you give yourself and your soulmate

1082
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:34.250
to find you, and you to find them.

1083
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.174
Often, you will pass each other by

1084
00:58:39.174 --> 00:58:43.978
because of your shrouds of expectation.

1085
00:58:46.298 --> 00:58:49.602
So if you can let go of those expectations

1086
00:58:49.602 --> 00:58:51.766
of what you think

1087
00:58:51.766 --> 00:58:55.256
you should have in relationships,

1088
00:58:56.466 --> 00:59:00.348
then you open up doors of possibility

1089
00:59:00.348 --> 00:59:03.504
to meet that soulmate

1090
00:59:03.504 --> 00:59:05.554
that you planned to be here with

1091
00:59:05.554 --> 00:59:08.590
and often you planned for a higher intention,

1092
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.106
so until you fulfill that intention,

1093
00:59:11.106 --> 00:59:12.854
you will not meet each other,

1094
00:59:14.604 --> 00:59:18.078
because your soul knows

1095
00:59:20.148 --> 00:59:24.242
that it needs to be prepared for this meeting in some way,

1096
00:59:25.782 --> 00:59:29.880
so that it can get the best of the opportunity.

1097
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.640
<v ->Therefore, there can be many great lessons</v>

1098
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.518
in surrendering that which perhaps

1099
00:59:35.518 --> 00:59:37.864
you never really had anyway,

1100
00:59:37.864 --> 00:59:41.734
and reconfiguring

1101
00:59:41.734 --> 00:59:44.704
your priorities of life.

1102
00:59:44.704 --> 00:59:48.180
Sometimes it is a simplification of life,

1103
00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.480
and realizing that,

1104
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.956
what really does matter in life to you.

1105
00:59:53.956 --> 00:59:55.776
<v ->Often there is a one soulmate,</v>

1106
00:59:55.776 --> 00:59:58.264
and often, you pair up and have been

1107
00:59:58.264 --> 01:00:00.290
through many, many lives together,

1108
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.498
and there will be a very strong connection.

1109
01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:05.120
And many of you, especially at this time

1110
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.082
on your planet, have come together,

1111
01:00:09.082 --> 01:00:11.638
have come with your soul mate as born

1112
01:00:11.638 --> 01:00:14.074
and incarnated in the same time period,

1113
01:00:14.074 --> 01:00:16.284
because you know that you have the power

1114
01:00:16.284 --> 01:00:20.606
as a unit to fulfill a higher intention.

1115
01:00:22.016 --> 01:00:24.290
So, yes,

1116
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:28.546
there are strong connections between souls,

1117
01:00:28.546 --> 01:00:30.918
paired up, because there is a strong power

1118
01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:34.784
between souls that way, there is a strong ability

1119
01:00:34.784 --> 01:00:39.272
for the unity of two individuals together

1120
01:00:39.272 --> 01:00:43.596
to have more force and power in their intentions.

1121
01:00:44.886 --> 01:00:47.444
But that does not mean that there is only one,

1122
01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:50.666
there can be several in a lifetime.

1123
01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:53.286
For some of you, that is the case.

1124
01:00:53.286 --> 01:00:56.906
You meet up with a soulmate,

1125
01:00:56.906 --> 01:01:00.494
and you have an impact on each other's lives

1126
01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:03.120
and you fulfill a mission,

1127
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.062
to stir each other up, often,

1128
01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:08.778
to allow each other to face something

1129
01:01:08.778 --> 01:01:12.942
that you would not see by yourself.

1130
01:01:12.942 --> 01:01:15.980
So you do each other favors,

1131
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.750
and helping one another to see who you really are,

1132
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.800
and you have this agreement, and often,

1133
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.294
you come together as two soulmates and you fulfill that,

1134
01:01:26.294 --> 01:01:30.534
you've allowed each other to see something about one another

1135
01:01:30.534 --> 01:01:32.168
and this

1136
01:01:34.956 --> 01:01:38.662
forces you or pushes you to your next level.

1137
01:01:40.172 --> 01:01:42.808
Now that is always not always the case,

1138
01:01:42.808 --> 01:01:46.210
sometimes you miss the opportunity,

1139
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.164
you can miss an opportunity,

1140
01:01:54.204 --> 01:01:55.316
but

1141
01:01:57.415 --> 01:01:59.669
we would like to express to you

1142
01:01:59.669 --> 01:02:01.397
that this is okay, too,

1143
01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:04.089
because this is part of your expression,

1144
01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:06.621
and there is no right and wrong.

1145
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:08.829
<v ->Now, contracts, as we speak of them,</v>

1146
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:10.586
spiritual contracts, are quite different

1147
01:02:10.586 --> 01:02:12.590
than many of your legal contracts,

1148
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:16.684
for there is no penalty if you do not do a contract.

1149
01:02:16.684 --> 01:02:19.766
These are simply high potentials for you,

1150
01:02:19.766 --> 01:02:22.986
so when you look across the room and you see someone,

1151
01:02:22.986 --> 01:02:26.160
and they look back and there's all these sparks flying

1152
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.992
and everything else, you may be looking at a contract,

1153
01:02:28.992 --> 01:02:31.548
you may be looking at something you wanted to do,

1154
01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:33.644
and the beginning of a relationship which is--

1155
01:02:35.162 --> 01:02:37.094
when the contract is over,

1156
01:02:37.094 --> 01:02:38.730
it could be to have children,

1157
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.846
it could be just to have a relationship,

1158
01:02:40.846 --> 01:02:42.916
it could be for a lot of things,

1159
01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:45.104
and when that is over, if you build that,

1160
01:02:45.104 --> 01:02:47.266
that continues, and if you do not,

1161
01:02:47.266 --> 01:02:49.198
it fades away, it goes away.

1162
01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:52.418
But these are potential, so there are many times

1163
01:02:52.418 --> 01:02:55.040
when it will seem like you are predestined

1164
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.892
to do something, but that is never true.

1165
01:02:57.892 --> 01:03:00.514
There are many times your natural path

1166
01:03:00.514 --> 01:03:03.274
of least resistance would seem to be taking you

1167
01:03:03.274 --> 01:03:05.876
in a certain direction, and that will look

1168
01:03:05.876 --> 01:03:08.406
like a path of predestination.

1169
01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:10.922
It is not, it is your own contract, saying,

1170
01:03:10.922 --> 01:03:12.808
"Come over here, this is one of the places

1171
01:03:12.808 --> 01:03:14.970
"you wanted to visit while you were here."

1172
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:16.856
<v ->As you have become an adult,</v>

1173
01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:19.800
you become less interested in the children's playground,

1174
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.606
and so that becomes but a distant memory,

1175
01:03:22.606 --> 01:03:24.354
and this will be the same,

1176
01:03:24.354 --> 01:03:26.930
it will move away into the distance

1177
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:28.862
as one creates a reality

1178
01:03:28.862 --> 01:03:31.806
that is more comfortable, comforting.

1179
01:03:31.806 --> 01:03:34.980
<v ->You have the idea of romantic love here</v>

1180
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.694
as being one-on-one, and we tell you,

1181
01:03:37.694 --> 01:03:39.718
when you finally take this veil off,

1182
01:03:39.718 --> 01:03:42.846
you're going to see love in places you've never dreamed.

1183
01:03:42.846 --> 01:03:45.698
You're gonna be able to walk down the street

1184
01:03:45.698 --> 01:03:48.228
and deeply fall in love with someone

1185
01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.135
without expectation,

1186
01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:53.987
and possibly even walk on past

1187
01:03:53.987 --> 01:03:57.069
and thank them for that experience.

1188
01:03:57.069 --> 01:04:00.959
Are there people that you really wanted

1189
01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:03.354
to meet on this planet, or really wanted

1190
01:04:03.354 --> 01:04:05.769
to do something with, are there very special people?

1191
01:04:05.769 --> 01:04:09.035
Yes, those are the people we are talking about

1192
01:04:09.035 --> 01:04:11.473
that you make contracts with, yes.

1193
01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.991
They jump out at you,

1194
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:16.303
you look across the room at someone you think you'd seen

1195
01:04:16.303 --> 01:04:18.031
a dozen times and all of the sudden,

1196
01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:19.549
if the contract is right,

1197
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:22.493
they look very, very good to you tonight,

1198
01:04:22.493 --> 01:04:26.245
and you'll go over there and try to figure out what this is.

1199
01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:28.709
And that's how something starts,

1200
01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:31.104
the contracts are chosen by both sides,

1201
01:04:31.104 --> 01:04:34.877
and if it is one of these deep contracts,

1202
01:04:34.877 --> 01:04:37.662
it feels just exactly as you speak.

1203
01:04:37.662 --> 01:04:41.753 line:15% 
(mystical music)

1204
01:04:49.737 --> 01:04:53.831
<v ->We wanted to thank you for taking that leap of faith</v>

1205
01:04:53.831 --> 01:04:57.417
and for following your ka,

1206
01:04:57.417 --> 01:04:59.717
following your heart,

1207
01:04:59.717 --> 01:05:04.047
and allowing yourself to be an instrument, a bridge

1208
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:08.923
for bringing this information to your culture,

1209
01:05:08.923 --> 01:05:10.755
so that your culture

1210
01:05:10.755 --> 01:05:13.699
can lead the rebellion stage

1211
01:05:13.699 --> 01:05:17.687
and grow up into the energies

1212
01:05:17.687 --> 01:05:19.619
that are present

1213
01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:22.149
and that will allow your lives

1214
01:05:22.149 --> 01:05:26.287
to be easy and fun and adventure.

1215
01:05:26.287 --> 01:05:28.293
<v ->So this is the cycle of the universe,</v>

1216
01:05:28.293 --> 01:05:32.577
this is the important message

1217
01:05:32.577 --> 01:05:34.647
that we would like to express,

1218
01:05:34.647 --> 01:05:38.143
is that the energy that you express from your soul

1219
01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:41.987
is here to be shared.

1220
01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:46.521
<v ->The most important thing that we can impart</v>

1221
01:05:46.521 --> 01:05:48.985
is to recognize

1222
01:05:48.985 --> 01:05:53.447
that there is a divine presence.

1223
01:05:54.807 --> 01:05:58.947
We always want to encourage each human

1224
01:05:58.947 --> 01:06:01.687
to find and develop

1225
01:06:01.687 --> 01:06:05.031
your personal relationship with God.

1226
01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:09.053
It is most important to recognize

1227
01:06:09.053 --> 01:06:11.951
that you are a spiritual being.

1228
01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:16.439
You happen to be wearing this human body suit,

1229
01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:19.599
but you are a beautiful,

1230
01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:22.221
radiant being of light.

1231
01:06:22.221 --> 01:06:25.763
And we only wish for each human

1232
01:06:25.763 --> 01:06:28.247
to come into greater self awareness,

1233
01:06:28.247 --> 01:06:31.191
that you really are part of the whole,

1234
01:06:31.191 --> 01:06:34.365
that you never are completely alone,

1235
01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:38.781
and that there are infinite beings of light

1236
01:06:38.781 --> 01:06:42.001
that love you and assist you and support

1237
01:06:42.001 --> 01:06:44.761
your very presence here on Earth,

1238
01:06:44.761 --> 01:06:48.119
and to see that, truly, your life has great purpose,

1239
01:06:48.119 --> 01:06:51.667
great meaning, and while you're here,

1240
01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:54.545
why not have as much fun as you possibly can, eh?

1241
01:06:54.545 --> 01:06:58.869
Why not, because if your life is lived in a joyful way,

1242
01:06:58.869 --> 01:07:03.587
your very presence inspires others to do the same.

1243
01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:05.979
<v ->Open the mind and open the heart.</v>

1244
01:07:05.979 --> 01:07:08.055
Open the heart and then open the mind

1245
01:07:08.055 --> 01:07:10.927
as broadly as possible and without conditions,

1246
01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:14.745
so that one can gather, whether there's energies,

1247
01:07:14.745 --> 01:07:18.793
or knowledge, or wellness, or health, or choice,

1248
01:07:18.793 --> 01:07:20.981
with an open mind and an open heart,

1249
01:07:20.981 --> 01:07:23.373
one has a vessel that includes

1250
01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:26.317
and one does not repel the energies,

1251
01:07:26.317 --> 01:07:28.249
for those that repel the energies

1252
01:07:28.249 --> 01:07:31.055
make hard the forces that gather,

1253
01:07:31.055 --> 01:07:33.677
they make it more difficult for nature.

1254
01:07:33.677 --> 01:07:35.885
You see, you have spoken of resources.

1255
01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.473
I tell you that humanity's hardness of heart

1256
01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:43.225
diminishes the resources more than even your strip mining

1257
01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:47.075
or what other destructive element you may consider.

1258
01:07:47.075 --> 01:07:49.335
<v ->There are two things that humans</v>

1259
01:07:49.335 --> 01:07:51.307
are very confused about.

1260
01:07:51.307 --> 01:07:53.731
Number one, you are creators and you have

1261
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:56.123
a responsibility to create.

1262
01:07:56.123 --> 01:07:57.943
The other part that you are confused about

1263
01:07:57.943 --> 01:08:00.289
is that you're not the only god.

1264
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:03.831
There are many, and part of your creations

1265
01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:06.157
are going to be how you flow with the other gods,

1266
01:08:06.157 --> 01:08:09.837
how you live in what we are calling an empowered society,

1267
01:08:09.837 --> 01:08:12.347
where each one can take their own power

1268
01:08:12.347 --> 01:08:14.785
and their own responsibility with it.

1269
01:08:14.785 --> 01:08:16.809
<v ->Honor who you are.</v>

1270
01:08:16.809 --> 01:08:21.317
Don't look for other people to tell you who you are,

1271
01:08:21.317 --> 01:08:24.491
what you are doing, what you should be doing,

1272
01:08:24.491 --> 01:08:26.561
what you should not be doing,

1273
01:08:26.561 --> 01:08:29.919
and how you should be doing this, and with whom,

1274
01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:33.967
and what specific form it should be coming through.

1275
01:08:35.247 --> 01:08:38.791
Don't let anyone, anyone, be your authority

1276
01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:41.209
to delineate for you what your life should

1277
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:45.303
look like, be like, et cetera, and feel like.

1278
01:08:45.303 --> 01:08:48.753
That is for you to take as the ultimate authority

1279
01:08:48.753 --> 01:08:53.169
for your life, to live your life according to who you are

1280
01:08:53.169 --> 01:08:55.653
because as the spark of consciousness,

1281
01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:58.025
your job is to become

1282
01:08:58.025 --> 01:09:01.015
as magnificent a spark as you are

1283
01:09:01.015 --> 01:09:04.879
and just like they say that there's no two snowflakes alike,

1284
01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:07.821
but there seems to be an infinite number of snowflakes,

1285
01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:10.353
the same is true with souls.

1286
01:09:10.353 --> 01:09:14.219
You are unique, you are different from everyone else.

1287
01:09:14.219 --> 01:09:18.587
Discover that, be that, expand that,

1288
01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:22.269
own that piece of the divine light that you are,

1289
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:25.349
and out of that will emerge

1290
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:28.799
the most glorious and wondrous life,

1291
01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:31.423
your mission, your purposes,

1292
01:09:31.423 --> 01:09:33.751
fulfilled, explored,

1293
01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:37.249
enjoyed, the ecstasy,

1294
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:39.813
the celebration of it all

1295
01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:42.343
will be yours.

1296
01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:46.447
<v ->And we also should just give yourself</v>

1297
01:09:46.447 --> 01:09:48.561
time with these four ideas,

1298
01:09:48.561 --> 01:09:51.137
for it can take time to digest them,

1299
01:09:51.137 --> 01:09:53.671
to begin to experience

1300
01:09:53.671 --> 01:09:55.741
what it is we are saying

1301
01:09:55.741 --> 01:09:58.501
in a way that allows you to get the handle on it,

1302
01:09:58.501 --> 01:10:00.577
to fully realize

1303
01:10:00.577 --> 01:10:02.925
what we have said here in this moment

1304
01:10:02.925 --> 01:10:05.365
of our interaction together.

1305
01:10:05.365 --> 01:10:09.181
For just hear these ideas, these four universal laws,

1306
01:10:09.181 --> 01:10:11.575
to just read them, to just say them

1307
01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:14.541
doesn't translate into necessarily understanding it,

1308
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.843
feeling it, knowing it,

1309
01:10:16.843 --> 01:10:20.919
realizing it, real-i-zing it

1310
01:10:20.919 --> 01:10:24.423
into your experience, moment to moment.

1311
01:10:24.423 --> 01:10:28.265
It is vital that as you choose more fully

1312
01:10:28.265 --> 01:10:30.913
and we perceive your society is choosing to come back

1313
01:10:30.913 --> 01:10:33.625
into a fuller understanding of its actual nature,

1314
01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:36.943
recognizing it is the creator of its reality,

1315
01:10:36.943 --> 01:10:41.039
it is vital that you begin defining yourself as the creator,

1316
01:10:41.039 --> 01:10:42.145
the one is the--

1317
01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:45.225
as the one is, what you put out is what you get back.

1318
01:10:45.225 --> 01:10:47.873
<v ->What if there was no one else but you?</v>

1319
01:10:47.873 --> 01:10:49.391
What if you were it?

1320
01:10:50.851 --> 01:10:53.717
With all the responsibility of your reality

1321
01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.477
upon your shoulders, what would you choose?

1322
01:10:56.477 --> 01:10:58.409
What would you choose differently

1323
01:10:58.409 --> 01:11:00.525
from what you have chosen?

1324
01:11:00.525 --> 01:11:04.237
That's why it's so important for us to emphasize,

1325
01:11:04.237 --> 01:11:06.601
take your power

1326
01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:09.407
back from wherever you've given it,

1327
01:11:09.407 --> 01:11:11.203
do not be a victim.

1328
01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:15.527
And the worst, the worst one is don't think that you

1329
01:11:15.527 --> 01:11:20.219
are some undeserving stupid wretch.

1330
01:11:21.509 --> 01:11:23.877
What is that marvelous song,

1331
01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:26.041
"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

1332
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:28.939
"that saved a wretch like me?"

1333
01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:32.781
Now, in order to be saved by this beautiful sound,

1334
01:11:32.781 --> 01:11:35.403
and be uplifted, you have to be a wretch?

1335
01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:41.569
That's this whole idea, that somehow or another

1336
01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:44.881
being on the Earth plane, being in the physical reality

1337
01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:47.685
is some kind of punishment, it is some kind

1338
01:11:47.685 --> 01:11:52.249
of forced imprisonment, an isolation,

1339
01:11:52.249 --> 01:11:57.237
the worst imprisonment is to be in an isolated cell.

1340
01:11:57.237 --> 01:12:00.619
That's the most difficult for anybody,

1341
01:12:00.619 --> 01:12:03.611
to be completely cut off.

1342
01:12:04.991 --> 01:12:07.727
So people think of this as a punishment.

1343
01:12:07.727 --> 01:12:10.073
No, you came here so that you would

1344
01:12:10.073 --> 01:12:12.649
have a blank slate for your discovery,

1345
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:15.869
and you came to a planet that was rich in possibility.

1346
01:12:15.869 --> 01:12:17.045
Look at how many species are

1347
01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:18.703
on this planet, for heaven sakes.

1348
01:12:19.953 --> 01:12:22.463
So you came in this whole

1349
01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:25.269
incredible flux of creativity

1350
01:12:25.269 --> 01:12:27.845
and part of your essential nature

1351
01:12:27.845 --> 01:12:31.341
as a god being is that you're creative.

1352
01:12:31.341 --> 01:12:32.927
<v ->Let us ignite your heart,</v>

1353
01:12:32.927 --> 01:12:35.181
let us help you remember who you are,

1354
01:12:35.181 --> 01:12:38.171
let us help you remember why you came to planet Earth,

1355
01:12:38.171 --> 01:12:40.241
but then do something with it,

1356
01:12:40.241 --> 01:12:43.323
find that passion, find that piece of life

1357
01:12:43.323 --> 01:12:45.693
that lights you up inside, no matter what it is,

1358
01:12:45.693 --> 01:12:47.303
and move in that direction.

1359
01:12:47.303 --> 01:12:49.695
You will find doors opening magically,

1360
01:12:49.695 --> 01:12:52.685
you'll find the universe, you'll find all the abundance

1361
01:12:52.685 --> 01:12:55.055
you could ever have, you'll find happiness

1362
01:12:55.055 --> 01:12:58.091
beyond your dreams if you'll follow that little spark

1363
01:12:58.091 --> 01:13:00.345
that you put there before you were born,

1364
01:13:00.345 --> 01:13:02.809
and yet so often you don't trust it,

1365
01:13:02.809 --> 01:13:05.935
so often humans think they have to work hard

1366
01:13:05.935 --> 01:13:07.663
and it shouldn't be fun and it has

1367
01:13:07.663 --> 01:13:09.503
to have these other pieces,

1368
01:13:09.503 --> 01:13:11.255
so you bring that in and you mess up

1369
01:13:11.255 --> 01:13:13.741
that which was once beautiful to you.

1370
01:13:13.741 --> 01:13:16.269
Let yourself shine, let it flow.

1371
01:13:16.269 --> 01:13:18.707
Put the details together later.

1372
01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:20.685
Now is the time of creation.

1373
01:13:20.685 --> 01:13:23.815
♫ What if we weren't really here

1374
01:13:25.867 --> 01:13:29.153
♫ Had the power to disappear

1375
01:13:31.479 --> 01:13:34.007
♫ Like a magic trick

1376
01:13:34.007 --> 01:13:37.847
♫ Yet without the prestige

1377
01:13:39.389 --> 01:13:42.767
♫ What if we could go on

1378
01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:47.897
♫ And live our lives

1379
01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:52.109
♫ Build on

1380
01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:55.421
♫ The way we dreamed

1381
01:13:56.783 --> 01:14:00.719
♫ What if we were meant for greater things

1382
01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:03.759
♫ Instead, we're just puppets on a string

1383
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:09.303
♫ Poisoned by the lies

1384
01:14:09.303 --> 01:14:13.377
♫ That we're made to believe

1385
01:14:13.377 --> 01:14:17.473
♫ So tonight let's break away from the pack

1386
01:14:17.473 --> 01:14:21.843
♫ We'll close our eyes and never look back

1387
01:14:21.843 --> 01:14:26.713
♫ Just one last jump

1388
01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.837
♫ And we'll be free

1389
01:14:31.497 --> 01:14:35.981
♫ Well, the clouds have finally lifted

1390
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:40.443
♫ And the rain's given way to the sun

1391
01:14:40.443 --> 01:14:42.927
♫ And as I stand with you

1392
01:14:42.927 --> 01:14:45.091
♫ Here in my arms

1393
01:14:45.091 --> 01:14:48.955
♫ I feel the battle's been won

1394
01:14:48.955 --> 01:14:53.621
♫ We fought for so many years

1395
01:14:53.621 --> 01:14:57.157
♫ Trying to make a change

1396
01:14:58.629 --> 01:15:01.231
♫ Woke up this morning

1397
01:15:01.231 --> 01:15:03.761
♫ To a brand new day

1398
01:15:05.131 --> 01:15:07.585
♫ A brand new day

1399
01:15:07.585 --> 01:15:12.093
♫ Sees the working man smiling

1400
01:15:14.033 --> 01:15:16.515
♫ A brand new day

1401
01:15:16.515 --> 01:15:20.655
♫ Sees the children laughing and playing again

1402
01:15:22.235 --> 01:15:24.753
♫ A brand new day

1403
01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:26.733
♫ Sees you

1404
01:15:26.733 --> 01:15:29.169
♫ And me, darling

1405
01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.969
♫ Closer to the dream

1406
01:15:32.969 --> 01:15:36.741
♫ It had seemed so far away

1407
01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:40.835
(gentle acoustic guitar)

1408
01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:55.331
♫ But only you could make a difference

1409
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:59.379
♫ Stand up and make a change

1410
01:15:59.379 --> 01:16:03.381
♫ Believe and miracles will happen

1411
01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:07.157
♫ And you'll find

1412
01:16:07.157 --> 01:16:11.069
♫ You got yourself

1413
01:16:11.069 --> 01:16:13.139
♫ A brand new day

1414
01:16:18.723 --> 01:16:21.241
♫ A brand new day

1415
01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:26.241
♫ Sees the working man smiling

1416
01:16:26.299 --> 01:16:29.533
♫ A brand new day

1417
01:16:29.533 --> 01:16:33.349
♫ Sees the children laughing and playing again

1418
01:16:34.609 --> 01:16:37.313
♫ A brand new day

1419
01:16:37.313 --> 01:16:41.637
♫ Sees you and me, darling

1420
01:16:42.947 --> 01:16:45.353
♫ Closer to the dream
