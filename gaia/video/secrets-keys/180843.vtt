I've faced my fears many
times, and what I've discovered

is that courage
reveals itself to us

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:10%
in moments just like this.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%

I'm terrified.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, see, that's where
people get courage wrong.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Courage isn't about
the absence of fear.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The key of courage lies in
acknowledging your fears

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward
in spite of them.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The bravest thing you
can be is yourself.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:10%
And not just in
the easy moments,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:10%
but in moments just like this.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So try to tap into
your intuition

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and treat this as a journey
that you're going to take.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:10%
You're about to discover
some incredible things,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:10%
not just about your
situation or other people,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:10%
but about yourself.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Believe me when I tell
you, you have no idea all

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%
that you are capable of.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:10%
There was a period
in my life where

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:10%
every day took all the courage
that I could muster just

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:10%
to make it through the day.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of a
handful of women who

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.784 align:middle line:84%
graduated from the United States
Military Academy at West Point.

00:03:44.784 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I graduated,
I was commissioned

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
as an officer in the army,
and I flew Chinook helicopters

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
for about seven years.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> You're kidding.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought you
were like a cosmetics sales

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
rep or something.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I would never think
you were a soldier.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I actually
get that a lot.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But I promise you, I
faced my fears many times,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes in life
or death situations.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
What I loved about
that whole journey

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
was that it allowed me to find
out how powerful I really am.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The more challenging
the situations

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:84%
got while I was in the army, the
more I stepped up to meet them.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those
people that learns

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the most by taking a different
path than everybody else.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've learned to trust
people that used to terrify me

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and to believe
that everyone comes

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:90%
into my life for a reason.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
In order to become
a hero, you have

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to
face some bad guys,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even be
a bad guy yourself.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
When I was in flight
school, I actually

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:90%
faced a situation like that.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I actually failed
a check ride, kind

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
of a test to check your
assessment of your flight

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
skills.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And it actually wasn't the
first one that I failed,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
so I had to go in front of the
school commander, a lieutenant

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
colonel, who was going
to determine my fate.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Would I get to stay
in flight school

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and try again or
be asked to leave

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and have to tell all my
friends that I was a failure?

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you that
having a lieutenant colonel

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
with my fate in his hands,
I definitely viewed him

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
as a potential bad guy.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the day
of the meeting came,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I went into his office
with my knees shaking

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
and my teeth chattering.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And just tried to look
like I wasn't terrified

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:90%
while I waited for his decision.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And what probably took a few
seconds felt like an eternity.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
He finally said the words
I was waiting to hear--

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:90%
you get to stay.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.592 align:middle line:90%
Big sense of relief.

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I think my heart
actually skipped a beat,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.716 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy to
hear him say it.

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I bet.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> But then he said something
that I never saw it coming,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
that took me
totally by surprise.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.899 align:middle line:84%
He looked me in
the eye and said,

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel sorry for the unit that's
going to get you because you

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:90%
are a liability, not an asset.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I was devastated.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I bet.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:10%
>> As a young lieutenant who
was brand new to the army,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:10%
I left his office that day
thinking, I'm a liability.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know which end was up.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:10%
And every unit I went to, I
did my hardest and my best

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:10%
to prove that I
could be an asset,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:10%
always working to prove myself.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:10%
And because I worked so
hard, I did become an asset

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:10%
to the units I was part of.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So for years, I
had that dialogue

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
in my head between
liability and asset,

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and it wouldn't have
been there without him

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:90%
making that statement.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So he actually helped
me find my superpowers.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
He was the bad guy I needed to
become the hero I wanted to be.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm scared, and I
have trust issues too.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't even trust my doctor.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid that she's made
a mistake or the tests

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:90%
aren't right.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, trust is a huge
component in the key

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:90%
of courage.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It actually takes
a lot of courage

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
to trust people when we
don't know the whole story

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
or what they're telling
us and can't prove it.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Other people might have life
experiences or perspectives

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
or insights, knowledge
that I don't have,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I'm going
to have to trust them

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:90%
for my own best interest.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people have made
the hard mistakes.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Learn the lessons from them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't make them yourself.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I see that now.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm going to have to
start trusting people more.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for stopping today.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:90%
You are so brave.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I just want
to give you a hug.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, I'm so glad that
I was able to stop and help you

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
You know what, I
believe that you

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.107 align:middle line:84%
will find the key of
courage, and that courage

00:07:34.107 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to give you the courage
to stay in the present moment

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
every step of this
journey because you are OK

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
as long as you're here.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And someday, your
experiences, I have

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.236 align:middle line:84%
a feeling they're going to help
a whole lot of other people.

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be nice if I could
help people like you helped me

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.672 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you will.

00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It was good to meet
you, Elizabeth.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Leslie.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.315 align:middle line:90%

00:07:56.315 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Where'd you go?

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I lost her again.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:90%
I just got here too.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Goldie, being successful at
this is not just about being

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.742 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I keep telling you,
there's more to being

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual guide than that.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That was so weird.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys feel that?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I never even saw you approach.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I tend to come
and go very quickly.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot to do today,
I'm in a bit of a hurry,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and Goldie here should have
prepared you for my arrival.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I take it you're Goldie?

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And who are you?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a hurry,
shouldn't you be going?

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I'm in
a hurry to see you.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I know you?

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for
a very long time.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:90%
You don't need that.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to help you.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
You just got a call
from your doctor, right?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, but how
would you know that?

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm your spiritual
guide, Elizabeth.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm Gwen, and I'm here to help
you through this very difficult

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> A spiritual guide?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:90%
You mean like an angel?

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If you choose to think
of me that way, that's fine.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But where I come from,
we don't use labels.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:90%
We're all one.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected, and our
mission is to help others.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to help when people
are facing great challenges.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Challenges, uh.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you do that?

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It all depends.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:90%
May I?

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, sometimes people
just need to know that someone

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:90%
cares.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Other times, they
might be having

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
trouble in their business,
and sometimes, there

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
might be something that keeps
them from moving forward

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
on their path in life, like
a crisis of confidence,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
a lack of funds, the
loss of a loved one,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:90%
or other relationship struggles.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, other times, it's
more serious than that.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Life and death, like what
you're dealing with now.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.737 align:middle line:84%
>> So you know I don't
have long to live.

00:10:20.737 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> You are not going to make it.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I'm aware
of your situation.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know what you
think you can do to help me.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
As Dorothy said to
the Wizard of Oz,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you have anything
in your bag of tricks for me.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's sort of true.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
When it's your time to
go, it's your time to go.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But we do have an
opportunity for you.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> An opportunity?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my favorite part.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We need people like you to
help others when they're facing

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:90%
overwhelming situations.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We've been watching
you, and we think you'd

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:90%
make a great spiritual guide.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
After all, you've
been helping others

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
for years as a
speaker and an author.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
You're very good at motivating
people and offering solutions.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait a minute.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Let me get this right.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I just found out I'm probably
going to die this year,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:90%
and you're offering me a job.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:90%
You have an opportunity for me.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I must be dreaming.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Stop her.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not kidding, Elizabeth.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:90%
We could help so many people.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you the
least bit curious?

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Remember when your dog died?

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%
You loved her so much.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
She was so old and sick,
and you thought you'd never

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:90%
get over losing her.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But then life
started to brighten,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and you started
to have fun again.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And remember, when
you lost your job?

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
You thought you'd never find
another one as rewarding

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:84%
or that paid you as well,
but you did, didn't you?

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you went on to own a
company of your own after that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:90%
I know because I was there.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I was there helping all the way.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>> How?

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.160 align:middle line:90%
How did I not know?

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to be a spiritual
guide more than anything.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't chosen like you though.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't some fancy
motivational speaker.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I was a feng shui master.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm willing to
be an apprentice, like on TV

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:90%
with Donald Trump.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to be the
ultimate project manager.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn all
I can about energy

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.746 align:middle line:90%
the seven keys of the universe.

00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It's OK. it's not
a competition, Goldie.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, people get the
help they need all the time.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole team of
experts, people here,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:84%
some who have
already crossed over,

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and they all possess
the wisdom of the ages.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
They know the keys to getting
through those roadblocks

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:90%
in life that we all face.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We have so many people
who want to help others

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%
through their challenges.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you one
of those people?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes I am, and
I organize it all.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
If I see a person struggling,
I find the exact expert

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to help that person
with that challenge.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So are you dead?

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What I am is
neither here nor there.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so funny.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what people say about me.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
They say, that Goldie, she's
neither here nor there.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, Goldie, what's
that over there?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Pardon me for asking, but how
did she become an apprentice?

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A very long time
ago, she rearranged some

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
of my furniture, and the most
incredible things started

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:90%
But back to you.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess I have
nothing else to lose.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I seem to be running out
of options at this point.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's spend some
time together today.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll introduce you to some
incredible experts and some

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:90%
that you already know.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll share with you
the wisdom of the keys,

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and you'll come to see
how powerful they are

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and how much they can
help other people.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:90%
So what do you say?

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to meet some
of the most remarkable people

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Say Yes.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Say yes.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, OK.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But let me guess, how are
we going to get there?

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Follow the yellow brick road?

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>> See, you still have
your sense of humor.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't get it.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth, I'm so excited.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:90%
I have so many people.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait for you to meet.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's going
to be so much fun.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't wait.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Goldie, why don't you
give us a few minutes.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a
walk with Elizabeth.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You be our lookout and don't
let anybody get past you.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I can do that.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:90%
We're off.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, postscript, over here.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds like my friend, Carol.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Come here, I'll introduce you.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Carol.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.492 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's good to see you.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>> You too.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm great.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm here because I'm
worried about you.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Gwen, this is Carol Scibelli.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:90%
We used to work together.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:90%
We would speak at conferences.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:90%
She's fabulous.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> So nice to meet you.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you too.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But earlier, you
didn't call her Elizabeth.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:90%
What did you call her?

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.767 align:middle line:84%
>> She called me
postscript, like P.S.

00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I love you at the end of a
letter because she said I was

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
so good at closing
a presentation.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.176 align:middle line:90%
It's so hard to close.

00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
what to say, so we

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
used to joke just
between us that what

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
are we going to say
to these people,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
like that's all, folks, or
the best ones we used to say,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Sit down on the bench here.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.571 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And she used that tell
the most incredible stories

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.302 align:middle line:84%
at the end, and these people
would leave with such great

00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
stuff in their head, kind of
like a song that you can't get

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:90%
out of your head.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that the point?

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I guess so, yeah, right.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
That's true, but what
about when you used to say,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
when you like someone,
they could do no wrong,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
but when you don't like
someone, they could do no right.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Ain't that the truth.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's for sure.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And we used to--

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know this, but you

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
might know this, that
our husbands passed away

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:90%
around the same time.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So we used to run these widow
groups, and just between us,

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:90%
widows can be kind of grumpy.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We used to laugh and
make each other laugh

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
because we kind of had the
same irreverent sense of humor.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we kind of
went our separate ways.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You did your business lunches
and the books that you wrote,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and I did comedic
speaking about resilience

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
into how to embrace change.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm just so
happy to finally meet you.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
helping us out today.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'm beginning
to see how this works.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
If I accept this
opportunity, I'll

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
have people like Carol who are
great who could help me as I

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:90%
go help other people, right?

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm not surprised
at all that you were offered

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
this position
because you've always

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
been-- you're a strong
person and you've always

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
had good and bad,
but you appreciated

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:90%
the good in your life.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's really why
I'm here to talk to you

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
about the key of appreciation.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Carol, I don't think
Elizabeth knows your whole

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.689 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind telling
us a little bit more

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.329 align:middle line:84%
about what got
you to this point?

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I have to?

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd love to hear it.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, all right.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, here goes.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought of myself
as a lucky person, based really

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.810 align:middle line:84%
only on the fact that
I was born on July 7,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
which is the seventh day
of the seventh month.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So my husband died
in April, there

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.435 align:middle line:84%
it is October, which is
Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I see all
these pink ribbons,

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and it reminded me that
my husband used to say,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
as long as I'm
alive, you never have

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:90%
to worry about breast cancer.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I'll take care of the girls.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I went, oh, wow, as
long as I'm alive.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I better go get these
babies checked out.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:90%
So off I go to a new doctor.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I fill out the
paperwork in the office,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor wanted
me to go into the office

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to get some background
information.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'm telling you, this is
almost exactly how it went.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
The doctor says, are your
parents still living?

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, my father
passed away when I was 17.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:90%
He was 57.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:90%
He had a brain tumor.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:90%
How about your mom?

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's 81.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
She's mentally ill, and we
haven't talked in years.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Every time I call her,
she hangs up on me.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.174 align:middle line:90%
That's funny to you?

00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:35.973 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:35.973 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry to laugh.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the way you say it.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything you say sounds
funny, like a joke.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, all right,
it's a tragedy.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Does your mother hang up on you?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It is the tragedy.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:90%
See, that's why we get along.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Then the doctor says, oh.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
siblings, and I said,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
well, yeah my sister was
three years older than me.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:84%
She passed away in 1997, when
was 50 from complications

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:90%
of Crohn's disease.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Then I thought, this
isn't sounding too lucky.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered-- the old
show "Queen For a Day"?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a horrible show where
they had three matronly women,

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
right, and they all stood
there in front of the audience,

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and the audience would vote
who had the worst life.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it was.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.485 align:middle line:84%
The winner got-- they
rolled in a washer--

00:19:27.485 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> A horrible present like
a dishwasher or a washer

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and dryer or something
really awful.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.785 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there, I'm
hearing what I'm saying.

00:19:34.785 --> 00:19:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, any
second, the recession

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.222 align:middle line:90%
is going to roll in a washer.

00:19:38.222 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I could use a new
washer and dryer.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.101 align:middle line:84%
She looks down at the paper
that I just filled out

00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oh, I
see you circled widow.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Just a few months ago.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, she said,
I'm almost afraid to ask,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:90%
but do you have any children.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, no,
no, they're fine.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm listening to myself,
and I'm thinking, wow.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Lucky me, huh?

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
On paper, my life doesn't
really look so lucky.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm like the lost dog who has
no tail, three legs, one ear,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:90%
and answers to the name Lucky.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my goodness.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But you've always been so
appreciative of everything.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.752 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
known that of you.

00:20:15.752 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to
focus on the good.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like the two brothers.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever about
the two brothers?

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I don't think I've
ever heard that story.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh my god,
these two brothers,

00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
they have a father who's
in jail for some horrible,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.409 align:middle line:90%
violent crime.

00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the brothers,
the older brother,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
is also in jail for
the same kind of crime,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.552 align:middle line:84%
but the younger brother
has a wonderful life,

00:20:32.552 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
he's a good member of the
community, he has a family.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
He's a good father,
good husband.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And they ask them,
why do you think

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:90%
your life out the way it did?

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.857 align:middle line:84%
And both of them said,
because of our father.

00:20:43.857 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes sense.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's something
I say in my presentations is

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that life is just 10% what
happens to you but 90%

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
how you deal with it.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, ladies, it's
great talking to you.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I know you have other people
to see and places to go,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
but you know what we always
say, you don't have to go home,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:90%
but you can't stay here.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Honey, it's been
great to see you again.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:90%
You're the best.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Take care.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
You're the best.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:90%
You're not so much the best.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks so much for your help.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You're great.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carol.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:90%
See you soon.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:20.608 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:20.608 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't wait for you
to meet Kate Emerson.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, I've
been waiting for you.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>> It's so wonderful
to meet you.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Come and have a seat.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Kate.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Kate.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm wonderful.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.496 align:middle line:84%
I've got some stories
to share with you.

00:21:41.496 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I can't wait.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely to see you again.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely to see you too.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, I believe you're
having a bit of a tough time

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I got some bad news,
and I'm hit with everything,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:90%
so trying to adjust.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the things when
you're faced with such big news

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
is thinking about the different
keys that can help you.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So with the key of vibration,
what I want you to think about

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is how do you think about
lifting your energy,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.505 align:middle line:84%
lifting your space,
lifting your life.

00:22:08.505 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Because quite often,
you can be feeling

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
heavy and dark and depressed and
just all of the stuff going on.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So my message that
I want to give you

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
is how do you think
about living light

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:90%
so that you can live large.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.319 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound great?

00:22:22.319 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it sounds great.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, because it's
just a notion, isn't it?

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'd like to talk
to you about clutter.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:90%
And often--

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Often with clutter, what is
one word that comes to mind?

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Closets.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Closets or garage or mess.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.464 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's often what it is,
but I want to give you a bigger

00:22:41.464 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
umbrella, something that
you can think about.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So clutter is
anything, or actually,

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
anyone, that no
longer serves you.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you
three aspects of clutter

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:84%
because I think that might help
relate to your story today.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So there is body clutter.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
This stuff and you know
with your diagnosis,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.947 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing now with
something in your body.

00:23:00.947 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:90%
So I'll come back to that.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:84%
There's body clutter, then
there's emotional clutter.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I think if we use
the word baggage,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:90%
we often understand that.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, all that
stuff we drag around.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
physical clutter,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.885 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that we can
see, touch, and feel.

00:23:14.885 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So I can give you a
little bit of information

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
about all of those because
actually they're a triangle.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And may I say, they
hold each other hostage.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
They're like-- they intertwine
and they hold each other,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:90%
or they can help each other.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So body clutter, I want you to
think about it as anything that

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:90%
is stealing your va va voom.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you know that word?

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Your energy, your va
va voom, your vitality,

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.602 align:middle line:90%
the sparkle in your eye.

00:23:39.602 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
You notice when
you look at someone

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and you know they're light
and they're vibrating.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And their body, it's another
key, the key of harmony.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
anything in your body

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that's no longer serving you,
so your body is giving you

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:84%
some messages today about,
I'm not sure, Elizabeth,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:90%
if you'd been looking after me.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But up until this point,
everything that maybe you've

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:84%
been eating or drinking
or cigarettes or alcohol

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
or over-the-counter
drugs that you've

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
been putting and ingesting
in, maybe up until this point,

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
it's been working for
you, because now you're

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
at a point where
you might choose

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.111 align:middle line:90%
to make a different decision.

00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:13.985 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to
think about this--

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
how do you increase the things
that will serve you more,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and how do you
decrease the things

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.667 align:middle line:90%
that will no longer serve you.

00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a seesaw,
rather than just

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.833 align:middle line:84%
trying to do it all
at once, because I

00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:28.867 align:middle line:90%
think that can be overwhelming.

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So, Elizabeth, listen move
to the second component

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:90%
of clutter--

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
emotional clutter or
mental or spiritual,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but baggage is
one of the words--

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:90%
We lug it around in that trunk.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
is unfinished that

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
is incomplete, that is
weighing heavy on your heart

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:90%
or your shoulders.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Courageous
conversations, perhaps,

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
that you might need to
have with other people,

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:90%
if you recognize that.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps even yourself.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
What about anything
to do with anger,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.562 align:middle line:84%
resentment betrayal, guilt,
all of the negative emotions.

00:24:58.562 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So be really mindful
of what you're

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
carrying heavy at the
moment and see if you

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:90%
can lighten up that load.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.924 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:05.924 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to think
about your physicality,

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that we can
see, touch, and feel.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.802 align:middle line:84%
We often change
the energy of where

00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:84%
we want to live by keeping
too much stuff around us,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and we almost fill our lives
with kilograms of stuff.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't expect everybody
to be a minimalist,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.895 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to
think about questions.

00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you go back home and
you're looking at the things

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that you've chosen to keep
in your life, do I love it?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Not like.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a pen, is it a
normal pen or a beautiful pen?

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Do I love it?

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.787 align:middle line:90%
Do I use it?

00:25:36.787 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:90%
So there you can't con yourself.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.703 align:middle line:84%
Like those clothes
that maybe you last

00:25:39.703 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:90%
wore two years ago or longer.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I think the most
important thing for you,

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
right now is, does this
add value to my life.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:25:49.804 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Because when you
walk into your home,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I want it to feel
like this for you,

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
so that you're surrounded
by things that energize you,

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.824 align:middle line:90%
that have real meaning.

00:25:56.824 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Not just stuff because you
can't be bothered to look at it

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
or you're just
keeping it by default.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So maybe just the one question
is, does this serve me

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:90%
and add value to my life.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And just take away that one
question back into your world.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So, Elizabeth, I know Gwen has
lined up some wonderful people

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:90%
for you to go and speak to.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm so blessed
that you came past,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and we got to meet each other.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I am so grateful
that I got to meet you.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:90%
You're just amazing.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.462 align:middle line:90%
You've helped me tremendously.

00:26:23.462 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I wish you well
on your journey.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.492 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:26:28.492 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew this was one
conversation you weren't going

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:90%
to want to miss.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:90%
She is incredible.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your help.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> See you soon.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> See you soon.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so excited.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I have someone very
special I want you to meet.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> She looks so familiar.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll introduce you.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, dear girl.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, darling.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:90%
So good to see you.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Elizabeth.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So nice to meet you.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:90%
You look so familiar.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Gloria Loring.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, of course, of course.

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's so nice to meet you.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, come in.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.245 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:11.245 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going to talk
about the key of vibration.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for this, by the way.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
We know that everything in the
universe is made up of energy,

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and energy vibrates at
varying frequencies.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
scientific fact.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything has a vibration.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Lower vibration,
higher vibration.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And knowing how to manage
or shift your vibration,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:84%
whether your news is
really the most traumatic

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
or even mildly
discomforting, knowing

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
how to manage a vibration
can be very helpful.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It was in 2000,
my mother finally

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:84%
passed after a long illness
with congestive heart failure.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And then two months
later, my father passed,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and it was sort of
this one two punch.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
had had over 10 years

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.670 align:middle line:90%
of meditation practice.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I had gotten
pretty good at managing

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.742 align:middle line:84%
the way my mind could
come up with negativity,

00:28:09.742 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
because I had become
aware of that,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and I could think very
distressing thoughts.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So my parents death
in such a close manner

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:90%
really threw me a curve.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed in the
months afterwards

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
that I got to the
point where I didn't

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:84%
feel like I had the energy
to go through my days.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Like I felt so pushed down.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I was like trudging through my
days and sort of lost momentum

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
from my daily life
for doing a project

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:90%
or I had lost my enthusiasm.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And one morning, I woke up and I
really heard for the first time

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:10%
a thought that had been
happening almost automatically.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And that thought was,
well, what's the point.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
get sick and die.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was that
wiser part of me

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:90%
who could now hear that thought.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I had just been
accepting that thought.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd just been saying it
to myself and getting up,

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and yeah, what's the point.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Just accepting it as
if it was something

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that was real and true.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking,
wait a minute.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:90%
I know what the point is.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The point is to take every day
I have and make the best of it.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm given.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I started
to be a cheerleader for myself.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I thought of some
alternative ideas

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:90%
that I could feed myself.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I wrote them down, and
that would encourage me

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.907 align:middle line:84%
like a good friend would
encourage you right now.

00:29:41.907 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, but look at
all you have in your life.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They'd say good things
to bolster your heart

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and give you reasons to still
have enthusiasm for your days.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, I did that, and
I found that changing

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.620 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of
my thought really

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
changed the vibration
of my energy, my body.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think
of it, depressed people--

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:90%
what is depression--

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.510 align:middle line:90%
means pushed down.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And low frequency energy.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Low frequency vibrational
thoughts really pull us down,

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and we can feel that
when we get depressed.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
We can feel ourselves caving in.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
level of vibration

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to
become aware of.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I would usually
start my meditation

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:84%
by lighting my candle and
then stopping for a moment

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and just saying,
hi, mom, hi, dad.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you're at peace now.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
a sweet time for me

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to feel like I
could speak to them.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:10%
And then one morning, and this
is months after they died,

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:10%
I started to say
hi, mom, hi, dad,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:45.712 align:middle line:10%
and I burst into great
gushing sobs, just--

00:30:45.712 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I imagine.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Just uncontrollable.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
thought, oh, grief now.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Grief was there.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Grief not prompted
by thoughts that I

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:84%
was having by my saying things
like, oh, I'm all alone.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll never see them again.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It was pure.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It was organic.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It was coming out of me,
and it needed to come up.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It needed to have its time.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And because I was making
space for it in that quiet,

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.014 align:middle line:84%
instead of rushing around,
that's why a lot of people

00:31:20.014 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
feel like they
need a lot of quiet

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.620 align:middle line:84%
when they're going through
grief because there's

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
a certain processing
that has to go on.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So the grief came,
and I realized

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to make
time and space for it.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And I sat with it.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the sobs
sort of subsided,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.470 align:middle line:84%
almost like a railroad train
chugging into the station,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:90%
running--

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Running out of steam.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Running out of steam.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I found that being
willing to sit with myself,

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:84%
like a good friend would, it's
almost like embrace the grief,

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.927 align:middle line:84%
embrace the pure feeling,
accept that that's OK.

00:31:57.927 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we think, oh,
I shouldn't cry now.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It's too much crying.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's six months ago,
it's eight months ago,

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:90%
it's three days ago.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.730 align:middle line:90%
No, if it's pure feeling.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But the key here to vibration is
figuring out, is this something

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:90%
that I'm telling myself.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Are these thoughts coming from
the mind that are negative,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that are defeating,
that are making

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:84%
me helpless and hopeless,
that are pressing the down,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:90%
ruining my enthusiasm for life.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Because enthusiasm needs to be
filled with the spirit of God

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and theos filled with God.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so are the thoughts
that I'm talking to myself,

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:90%
or am I making space to listen?

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So as you go on this
journey ahead of you,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:84%
watch what you're
thinking, and bring

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.640 align:middle line:84%
your attention to how you might
need to listen in that day.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Is there pure honest feeling,
or is there a whole lot

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.050 align:middle line:90%
of trash talking going on?

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

I received one of the worst
phone calls a parent can get.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
A grave voice on the
other end of the line

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:84%
shared with me that
our son Tyler had been

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:90%
involved in a car accident.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.070 align:middle line:84%
He had flipped his
car over and over,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:30.987 align:middle line:84%
and then came the dreaded
words, your son is quadriplegic.

00:34:30.987 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, as parents, you
fear that sort of phone call.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They were planning
on life flighting him

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:84%
from Durango,
Colorado to Denver,

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where they would perform
emergency surgery to stabilize

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:90%
his neck.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:10%
And within an hour, I
had quickly packed a bag

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.339 align:middle line:10%
and bolted up to the
Cleveland Airport,

00:34:52.339 --> 00:34:54.880 align:middle line:10%
trying to get on an overbooked
flight that would get me there

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:10%
in time to see my son
before he went into surgery.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Somehow, I got on that flight.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It was overbooked.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I was in eighth in line.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember praying
so deeply to God,

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
please help me
get there in time.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Help me to help my son.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Help me to help my family.

Help me to be strong.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was being
sucked into this tornado,

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and the further I got sucked
into it, the darker it became.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying over and over
to myself, I can't do this.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, that loud
whooshing sound evaded,

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and the darkness
started to dissolve.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
become enveloped

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:90%
in this cocoon of white noise.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.770 align:middle line:84%
It became this place
of unfathomable peace,

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and it was then that
I felt the presence.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you that
I heard the voice of God,

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.950 align:middle line:84%
but I heard the words
from deep within.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:84%
God said, you can
do this, and I said,

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:90%
but I don't have the tools.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do this.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I was given the most
profound advice I have ever

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:90%
contemplated in my life.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And God said, treat this
as if it was something

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.760 align:middle line:90%
you had chosen.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
My first thought was, why
would I choose to do that?

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Why would I choose such
an injury for my son--

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
maybe for me, but
not for my son.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.430 align:middle line:84%
What I came to appreciate,
though, over the course of time

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:84%
is that life has a way of
presenting to us just what we

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:90%
need at just the right time.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:84%

of the attachment

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to that which you consider good
in life, as much as you let

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:84%
go of the aversion to what you
think of as bad in your life,

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
then you can come to
understand this truth.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:56.630 align:middle line:84%
This truth is, there
is no duality in life.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.712 align:middle line:84%
Generally, we think in
terms of duality, right?

00:36:58.712 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:84%
There's hot, there's cold,
there's good, there's bad,

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:90%
there's high, there's low.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:90%
They're really one and the same.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We're really looking
forward to talking with you.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh goodness.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.552 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:38:43.552 --> 00:38:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So I heard you're having a
really hard time right now.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I just found out I'm not
going to live much longer,

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:90%
and I'm really overwhelmed.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to get through
the next few months at all.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you think about
where we're sitting right now

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and the beauty of the ocean
and the rocks and the sun,

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
everything's in perfect
order and harmony.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the more orderly way

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that the universe works
and how the sun is right

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:84%
in the right place every
morning in the East

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and is beautifully set
in the West and how

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
all the planets elliptically
orbit around the sun.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:84%
If you think about how the
oceans ebb and flow, is

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in consistent
harmony all the time,

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that is the
perfection that exists

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
not only in nature, but within
you as well, and in coherence.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, what has to
happen in order for you

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:84%
to feel like your in
coherence and in total balance

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.592 align:middle line:90%
and in total harmony?

00:39:53.592 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the answer is what I
call getting your spiritual,

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:84%
your emotional, your mental,
and your physical body aligned,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and just look at the perfection
of everything that's here right

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.750 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you get everything
aligned in your mind

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and in your heart, in your
body, and in your spirit,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that's what will give
you the peace of mind

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that you need in
order to feel better.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in spite of everything
I'm going through right now?

00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:24.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in spite of everything
you're going through right now.

00:40:24.793 --> 00:40:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Those are circumstances
and conditions

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that are beyond your
control right now.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what you want to do is
control what you can't control,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:84%
but then trust that there's
a higher order of everything,

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:90%
a higher vibration.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when you
don't have all of the facts,

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:84%
then you have to go to one
of the keys of vibration,

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:90%
and that's having faith.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And faith is the
absence of all the fact.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to trust in the orderly
perfection of how everything

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
works beautifully and magically
right here on planet Earth

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and in the entire cosmos.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And since you only have
a limited amount of time,

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:84%
if you think about this,
imagine if the time you

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:90%
had was the sand in my hand.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And all the sand that's
going through my hand,

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
you have a choice of
where to focus it.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so if you focus it
on what you don't want,

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.660 align:middle line:84%
you've just lost the most
valuable assets you've got.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And so by focusing all of
your sand, all of your time,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
on the things that
you want, that's

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:90%
where the miracles happen.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're trading
your life for what you want.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're trading
your life for the highest

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:84%
possibilities of
good, and that's

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
what you're trading
your life to be

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.130 align:middle line:84%
able to achieve what
it is that you want,

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.040 align:middle line:84%
instead of focusing on
what it is you don't want.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Focusing it on the things that
could go wrong, may go wrong,

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and may shorten your life.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is really one of
the key principles of life

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:84%
is use your sand,
use your time wisely,

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and prime your brain to
learn how to figure that out.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the keys to success.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If I wake up tomorrow and I'm
going to try and focus on all

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.490 align:middle line:84%
the positive aspects of my life
instead of focusing on what

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:84%
the future holds for
me, my prognosis,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.310 align:middle line:84%
does it get easier
the more you do it?

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think
tomorrow, I'll really

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:84%
be focused on
changing how I think.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But the next day and the next
day and the next day, I mean,

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
is it like being on a diet,
or is it something that

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.030 align:middle line:90%
gets easier the more you do it?

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the antidote for fear,
the antidote for uncertainty is

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:90%
gratitude.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when you focus on what
you are grateful for and what

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.790 align:middle line:84%
you do have in the
present moment,

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.900 align:middle line:84%
if you focus on what
you've had in the past,

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:84%
then you can predict all
the wonderful things that

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
in the upcoming future.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of
what the prognosis is,

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
miracles do happen.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
ways to instigate,

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:84%
set across, and
set off a miracle,

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is to get into alignment with
the magic of the universe.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Get into the magic of what's
possible and live in that space

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:84%
instead of in the fear, the
uncertainty, the doubts,

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.960 align:middle line:84%
the overwhelm, the confusion
that all of the prognosis

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.320 align:middle line:84%
has been giving
you up until now.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.959 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, that's really

00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:22.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're going to feel like
I'm going to trade your life--

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:90%
however long it's going to be--

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:84%
for exactly what is
worth trading it for.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you get
to be so smart?

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It seems like you just
have so many answers

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:35.430 align:middle line:90%
for having the best life ever.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most miraculous,
amazing things happened to me.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I met a wonderful man,
who was happily married,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.760 align:middle line:84%
spiritually evolved,
very, very philanthropic,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and saw something in
me that I didn't see.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel confident.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel certain.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like I
deserved to achieve success.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
gifts he gave me was

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.460 align:middle line:84%
the gift of teaching
me some universal laws.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.700 align:middle line:84%
He taught me the perfection of
the universe and the laws that

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.350 align:middle line:84%
govern how life exists
and how we evolved.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:84%
He got me out on a track
to personal development,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to learning from
experts, to learning

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
what to do, how to do it, when
to do it, and why to do it.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And every day for
one hour, he would

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.880 align:middle line:84%
have me upgrade my
knowledge and my skills

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:84%
through books, through cassette
tapes, back 30 plus years ago,

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:84%
through learning from mentors
and people who already achieved

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:84%
the success that I
was hoping, wishing,

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.110 align:middle line:90%
and praying to achieve.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And just like you learn how
to walk one step at a time

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and you learn the alphabet
one letter at a time,

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.970 align:middle line:84%
then one word at a time,
then one sentence at a time,

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.670 align:middle line:84%
over the last 30
years, I maintained

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
being a voracious
student of the things

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that, again, I believe is
one of the keys to success,

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and that is
following my passion.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Following the gifts
that I did have.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I always loved
people, I always

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:90%
loved communicating with people.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty loving and
caring, and so I wanted

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.120 align:middle line:90%
to share my life with others.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I grew more
knowledgeable,

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and as I failed and succeeded
and then I shared the failures

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and successes with
others, people

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:84%
wanted to listen
more and learn more.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Just like it's beautiful
to be here in the beach,

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.300 align:middle line:84%
where you feel your
best, it's so important

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to surround yourself
with people who

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.260 align:middle line:90%
will make you feel your best.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
They're going to bring out
the best in your energy,

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:84%
in your emotions, and in all of
the goodness that's within you.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This has just
been incredible.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I totally shifted
where my mind is at.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.300 align:middle line:90%
I really can't thank you enough.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
introducing me to John.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.497 align:middle line:90%
It's just been great.

00:45:52.497 --> 00:45:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And, John, thank you so
much for your help today with

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so joyful
for me to do that.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.165 align:middle line:90%
>> This is wonderful.

00:45:59.165 --> 00:46:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.808 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:01.808 --> 00:46:05.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:90%
How was it?

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:10%
Isn't John wonderful?

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.680 align:middle line:90%
He's so smart.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Are we done yet?

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see anyone,
so nobody got by me.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you, dear.

00:46:16.749 --> 00:46:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do you think so far?

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.140 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.180 align:middle line:90%
What you going to do?

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know what to think.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I got that call
from my doctor this morning,

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I've been scared.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm confused.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to
question my own sanity.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.831 align:middle line:90%
I get so confused.

00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Have you gotten
your things done, dear?

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm working on it.

00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:38.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on it.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.250 align:middle line:90%
That's my Goldie.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:44.730 align:middle line:90%
She's a trip, huh?

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I know.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:90%
That's Jodi.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
introduce you to her.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:53.190 align:middle line:84%
She's an amazing
psychotherapist.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.640 align:middle line:84%
She helps people who've
passed their fear

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.037 align:middle line:90%
and learned to love themselves.

00:46:57.037 --> 00:46:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I can't wait to meet her.

00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:90%
She sounds amazing.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.460 align:middle line:90%
My gosh, Jodi.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.546 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:47:04.546 --> 00:47:05.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:05.346 --> 00:47:06.146 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Jodi, meet Gwen.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Gwen has been showing me
around and introducing me

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:84%
to the most outstanding
experts today,

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.430 align:middle line:84%
so I shouldn't be
surprised to see you here.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Come in and sit down.

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm teaching people
how to forgive and let go.

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:10%
People want to let go,
but they don't know how,

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and forgiveness is even harder.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.270 align:middle line:10%
People assume that
forgiveness and letting go

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.300 align:middle line:10%
condones the bad things
that people do to us.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.190 align:middle line:84%
That people get away with
something without reparation,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what
it's about at all.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness and letting
go is about freeing

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.440 align:middle line:90%
the person that's in pain.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Interesting.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.800 align:middle line:10%
And when someone is holding
on to something that's

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.310 align:middle line:10%
hurting them, either
emotionally or spiritually, how

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.110 align:middle line:10%
do you get them to let go?

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer lies in
the key of empathy,

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.510 align:middle line:84%
which explains why
people do what they do.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Hurtful people aren't mean
because they don't like you.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.120 align:middle line:10%
They're mean because they
don't like themselves.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And once we don't take
it personally anymore,

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.850 align:middle line:10%
it frees us.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:14.330 align:middle line:10%
And if we don't think
it's us, then we

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.690 align:middle line:10%
don't have to be hurt or
attached to this situation

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:18.680 align:middle line:10%
any longer.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes so much sense.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.877 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so glad
that you think so.

00:48:22.877 --> 00:48:24.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, people want to let go.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:10%
They just don't know how.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:10%
It's so hard.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of the
problem is that our mind is

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:30.950 align:middle line:90%
searching for answers.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:34.140 align:middle line:84%
We want to know what
happened, and why it happened.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So confusing when
something bad happens

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.600 align:middle line:90%
and we want somebody to blame.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And we think, was it
us that caused it,

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.580 align:middle line:90%
or why did somebody do that.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Without the key of empathy,
we can't understand

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.690 align:middle line:10%
why people do what they do,
and we keep questioning,

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:10%
and this causes
so much suffering.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know exactly how this
feels because I was once

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.170 align:middle line:84%
stuck in a situation
where I couldn't

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:84%
get my mind off
someone who hurt me,

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and I thought about it
obsessively all the time,

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about
it all the time.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I thought about this
conversation with him

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:10.520 align:middle line:84%
in my mind over and over, like
trying to prove myself to him

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:84%
or trying to get him
to see how he hurt me.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I wanted validation
and understanding

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.520 align:middle line:84%
from him, the last person
that would give it to me.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And my friends, they tried to
help me, and they were saying,

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.280 align:middle line:90%
don't take it personally.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.610 align:middle line:10%
This made it worse because not
only was I hurt and frustrated

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.620 align:middle line:10%
about this situation, I
was handling it wrong.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I had hurt, and then
I had negative self judgment.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:37.880 align:middle line:84%
You see how we make
ourself so miserable?

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:43.160 align:middle line:10%
So, one day, I was walking
in this path to a waterfall,

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.990 align:middle line:10%
and it's so beautiful.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.840 align:middle line:10%
And instead of looking at
that beauty all around me,

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:10%
I was stuck in my head,
ruminating yet again

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:10%
about this situation.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I tried to let it
go a million times,

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and I just kept
thinking about it.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.880 align:middle line:10%
Once I got to the waterfall,
I lied down on the bank

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.110 align:middle line:10%
to do a meditation, and I
was looking after the cliff.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.850 align:middle line:10%
And I saw these
the yellow leaves.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:08.794 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:50:08.794 --> 00:50:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They were like
suspended, and I realized

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.270 align:middle line:84%
it was the air pressure from the
waterfall that suspended them

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:18.170 align:middle line:84%
in air, and they were
floating and swirling around.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And it dawned on me.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was like
one of those leaves.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I could take as long as I wanted
to on this path to forgiveness.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I also understood that when I
set the intention to let go,

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:84%
those negative thoughts were
going to keep coming back.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.760 align:middle line:90%
That's just what they do.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.430 align:middle line:84%
People hold on to stuff
because their self-worth

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.130 align:middle line:90%
is woven into that.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.080 align:middle line:84%
They think if they
let it go, that

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.390 align:middle line:84%
means it didn't matter
that it happened.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And if it didn't matter that
it happened, they don't matter.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And they hold on to it because
they don't want to not matter.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.340 align:middle line:10%
And so I realized
there's a three step

00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.200 align:middle line:10%
process to letting go that
helps people learn how to do it

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.350 align:middle line:10%
and figure it out and keep
their self-worth intact.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The first step is
deciding that you

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.250 align:middle line:90%
deserve to be free or forgiven.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is, remember, our
mind tries to find answers,

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's asking all
those kinds of questions.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing
that we need to do

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.830 align:middle line:10%
is stop those negative self
judgments about what happened.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You say, it happened, it
wasn't OK, I didn't deserve it,

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:31.360 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have to
define me any longer.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So you validate yourself,
and you keep that self-worth

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:37.760 align:middle line:90%
intact, and then you forgive.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.020 align:middle line:90%
That's step one.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And step two is just
setting the intention.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.220 align:middle line:90%
It's the easiest one.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.387 align:middle line:10%
We can do that.

00:51:44.387 --> 00:51:46.970 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is say it out
loud or say it in your heart.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Just set that intention
that I want to let this go.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the easy part.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And step three-- now step three
is the most important piece.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.770 align:middle line:10%
This is most important step,
and it's often forgotten.

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:01.350 align:middle line:10%
You don't realize this one.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.150 align:middle line:10%
It's practice.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:05.769 align:middle line:90%
Practice.

00:52:05.769 --> 00:52:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to practice
because remember

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
those negative thoughts
are going to come back,

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and we have to have
compassion for them

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:84%
when they come back
instead of judging them.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when we judge
them, we just get attached

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and caught up in them again.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.970 align:middle line:90%
But this is a thing--

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.970 align:middle line:84%
we'll have to do that
over and over again.

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Because for a while, as
we're practicing this,

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.540 align:middle line:84%
it's going to come back
over and over again.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.490 align:middle line:10%
The key of empathy
helps us understand

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.040 align:middle line:10%
that people are
hurt and insecure,

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:10%
and we might not even know
it by looking at them.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.890 align:middle line:84%
When we understand that and
have compassion and empathy,

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.720 align:middle line:84%
then we can let
go of past hurts,

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and we never get hurt
in the same way again.

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Jodi, that is beautiful.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:10%
I am so grateful that
you were here today

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.736 align:middle line:10%
to share your insights with us.

00:52:53.736 --> 00:52:55.110 align:middle line:10%
And I know that
Elizabeth will be

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.950 align:middle line:10%
counting on you and
your three step process,

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:01.520 align:middle line:10%
if she takes my offer.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Easy to see why I love
her so much, isn't it?

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.720 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for being her today.

00:53:06.428 --> 00:53:07.521 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> See you soon.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:53:13.898 --> 00:53:14.698 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:53:21.066 --> 00:53:21.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:22.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Farida.

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:23.820 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, this is
for Farida Akadiri.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> So nice to meet you.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Elizabeth.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> She has many amazing things
to share with you about the key

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.190 align:middle line:90%
of faith.

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so glad you're here.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Please have a seat.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, I would like
to ask you a question.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what is the
definition of faith?

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Faith is having an unshakable
conviction in something

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:59.380 align:middle line:90%
without proof or evidence.

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Generally, people when
they think about faith,

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.140 align:middle line:90%
they think first about religion.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to share
with you the importance

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.800 align:middle line:90%
of having faith in yourself.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.220 align:middle line:90%
You have to believe.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:17.130 align:middle line:10%
You have to have that conviction
that you, you can be, do,

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:21.570 align:middle line:10%
and have everything and
anything you want in life.

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to know how.

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know how
much time it's going to take.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And even though your
current situation

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.890 align:middle line:84%
doesn't match the results
you want in your life

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:35.914 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
the house you want,

00:54:35.914 --> 00:54:37.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
perfect relationship,

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.470 align:middle line:84%
you want you don't
have the perfect job

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.900 align:middle line:84%
or the perfect
finances you want.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.920 align:middle line:84%
You still need to
have that trust

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.050 align:middle line:90%
in yourself and in your dreams.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:53.010 align:middle line:84%
On a larger scale,
the key of faith

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is about trusting that there
is something bigger than you.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:04.620 align:middle line:84%
You can call it God, you can
call it infinite intelligence,

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.890 align:middle line:90%
higher consciousness, life.

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But the trust that the universe
is there to support you.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I was engaged, and
my fiancee broke off

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:20.430 align:middle line:84%
the engagement to marry
another woman one month later.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.930 align:middle line:90%
I lost my faith in God.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.340 align:middle line:90%
I lost my faith in myself.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.280 align:middle line:90%
I lost my faith in my dreams.

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm a nice girl.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I was working, giving my best.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't deserve that.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Until one day, I heard that
little voice inside my head.

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.625 align:middle line:84%
You can call it my intuition,
or God, on my higher self.

00:55:44.625 --> 00:55:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And that voice said,
Farida, you hit the bottom.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It's time to rise up.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:58.220 align:middle line:84%
At that specific moment,
I made a decision.

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create
and live my dream life.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
time it's going to take.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to do it.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:06.730 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you
make such decisions,

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.650 align:middle line:84%
you are opening
doors for yourself.

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:17.980 align:middle line:84%
People are coming your way--
situation, opportunities

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:21.320 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't see before.

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and I stopped acting and
feeling like a victim.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Now when I see back,
that was the best gift

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.100 align:middle line:90%
the universe could give me.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Faith is something that
you can build and deepen

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.030 align:middle line:90%
You have to ask.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask for
different guidance

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to help you
strengthen your faith.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It can be your
faith in yourself,

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:49.040 align:middle line:84%
your faith in your dreams,
your faith in life.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:53.130 align:middle line:90%
But ask, and you would receive.

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Take a regular journal,
and I want you every day

00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:02.800 align:middle line:84%
before going to bed, write
how life had loved you today.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.920 align:middle line:84%
What that gift you
received from life.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to write every day and
start building those evidences

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that the universe loves
you, and you will always

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:20.690 align:middle line:84%
have that to remember you
what you have received.

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
key of harmony.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Be in harmony with
life, with the universe.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Then, do a success board.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take all the
pictures of your achievements,

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to watch
it on a regular basis.

00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Because what, each time you're
going to have a challenge.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.890 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:46.380 align:middle line:84%
You're going to watch that
beautiful board and say, wow,

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I'm powerful,
I'm successful.

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Wow, I'm amazing.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Wow, I'm a super achiever.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And then your confidence
is just going to build up.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And the last tip I would
like to share with you

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.190 align:middle line:90%
is get the support system.

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Have someone or
a group of people

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.460 align:middle line:84%
who are going to support
you to build and strengthen

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.910 align:middle line:84%
your faith, because that's
the beauty with faith.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're
going to have doubts.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:20.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
doubt in ourselves.

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:23.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to doubt if we have
to chosen the right dreams.

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to doubt, oh,
is God really supporting me

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.730 align:middle line:84%
because I'm really in
something terrible right now

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and I have no clue how I'm
going to get out of it.

00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK because
with your gift journal,

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:42.450 align:middle line:84%
with your success board,
and with your support group,

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:45.240 align:middle line:84%
each time, you're going
to remember yourself.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I did it once, I did it twice,
I can do three times, 20 times,

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.320 align:middle line:90%
100 times.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
being unstoppable.

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.250 align:middle line:84%
You started manifesting
and creating

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.110 align:middle line:90%
the life of your dreams.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Life loves you.

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Put your faith into practice.

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Practice having
faith in yourself.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Practice having
faith in your dreams,

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and practice having
faith in life.

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.895 align:middle line:90%


00:59:14.895 --> 00:59:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew you would have the
perfect message of faith

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.040 align:middle line:90%
for Elizabeth today.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for being here.

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Farida, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Goodbye.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:39.510 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, I want to
change gears a bit here.

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you're familiar
with Brian Tracy.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> He's an incredible expert
on business and success.

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, business
owners and entrepreneurs

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.680 align:middle line:84%
can have a lot of
trouble dealing

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.900 align:middle line:84%
with all the matters of
business because there's

00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.910 align:middle line:90%
so much to know.

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So in a case like this, if you
were working with a business

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
owner or an entrepreneur,
Brian would be the expert

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.170 align:middle line:90%
that you'd go to for help.

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now since we're
speaking of Brian,

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.770 align:middle line:84%
media icon Carly Alyssa Thorne
just told me that she has a big

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:18.520 align:middle line:90%
surprise for us.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.490 align:middle line:90%
So come this way with me.

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:25.836 align:middle line:90%


01:00:25.836 --> 01:00:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, I want to introduce
you to Carly Alyssa Thorne.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
She has a lot of
information to share

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.310 align:middle line:90%
with you in the key of empathy.

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much, and
I'm so grateful to meet you,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth.

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm happy to meet you too.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I would love to share about
empathy because it's such

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.790 align:middle line:90%
a sometimes misunderstood thing.

01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
We all think we know what
someone else is going through.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And me, I'm young,
I'm only 50 years old,

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and I've had 30 surgeries.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So people looking at
me and they're like,

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.060 align:middle line:90%
oh, you're so young.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
You can just do
anything, and they

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
don't understand there are
times that, yes, I struggle.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And just realizing
that other people

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
are going through things that
I may have no clue about.

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been a
really big journey for me

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and my team members
and my business.

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of business, I
have a secret to share with you.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go interview
Brian Tracy on business,

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what I
need with my team members.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, you guys can
come along with me,

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
but you have to be quiet,
and you can eavesdrop.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So come on.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:37.400 align:middle line:90%


01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.334 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the number one
reason for business success?

01:01:41.334 --> 01:01:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a great question.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The number one reason for
business success is high sales,

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and that means that people have
developed the right product

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and the right service
for the right market

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
at the right price, with the
right features and benefits

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:56.150 align:middle line:90%
in competition with others.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And high sales is the number
one reason and the number

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:02.750 align:middle line:90%
one focus on of all businesses.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> What is a number
one business failure?

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's the
flip side of the coin.

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.870 align:middle line:90%
It's low sales.

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And Forbes magazine has
said that the number one

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
reason above all other
reasons for business problems

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is that people don't
want the product.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening
today is about 80%

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of products fail because
they are thought up

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
by some of the most brilliant
people in the world,

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
they spend billions of
dollars on market research,

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
but the customers don't want
it, don't need it, or not

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
interested in it, will
not pay that price.

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Or if they don't want it,
they buy it from a competitor.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And so low sales is
the number one problem

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
of all businesses
in the world today.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
There's four critical factors
for a product or service

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.320 align:middle line:90%
to be successful.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.639 align:middle line:84%
Number one is has to do a job
that the customer wants done.

01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine that
a customer buys a product

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
or service to do a job
that they need done

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and they pay you to do the
job with a product or service,

01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
so what is the job that
your product or service

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.606 align:middle line:90%
does for them?

01:03:00.606 --> 01:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Now a job means that there's
a beginning, a middle,

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and an end, and at the
end of the process,

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
the customer has something
that they didn't have before.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
My favorite word in all of
business is "transformation."

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Is what is the
transformation that

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
takes place in the
customer's life and work

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
using your product?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Customers today,
psychologically,

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
buy in anticipation
of how they will

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.240 align:middle line:90%
feel after using your product.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So you say, how
will customers feel?

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
What will be their
experience as a result

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.460 align:middle line:90%
of using my product or service?

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And products fail because
they don't do a job

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
or they don't do that job or
somebody else does it better.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Every product or service
is an answer to a problem.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, companies will often
develop a solution to a problem

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.160 align:middle line:90%
that people don't have.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And this, again,
is they'll develop

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
what is a perfect
product scientifically,

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
but people don't realize
that they have this problem,

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
or the problem is
not intense enough

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
for them to want to
spend money to solve it,

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
or somebody else can solve
it better and cheaper.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
The third reason is that
people do not buy products,

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.460 align:middle line:90%
they buy benefits.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the benefit
to the customer

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
of buying and using your
product or service is not clear.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Often, it's not clear
to the people who

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:17.370 align:middle line:90%
are in the product development.

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And the last two things
I say, every product

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.560 align:middle line:90%
has a goal to be achieved.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask, what is
the goal that somebody wants

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
achieved and how does your
product help them achieve

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that goal faster, more
efficiently, at lower cost,

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.300 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And the final question is, what
is the pain that it takes away.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Is people buy a
product or service

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:39.840 align:middle line:84%
like they buy a headache remedy
because they have a pain.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to identify
clearly what is the pain,

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and is the pain intense
enough for the customer

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.830 align:middle line:90%
to want to take action.

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not,
remember, Amazon

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
has a million products that
you can buy on Amazon today,

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.090 align:middle line:90%
1 million.

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:53.420 align:middle line:90%
They'll soon have 2 million.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
products out there,

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and there's hundreds of
products in your space.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And so yours has to be better,
superior, more helpful,

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:03.740 align:middle line:90%
more appropriate than any.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why companies fail,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
because their product
or service is not

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
what people want to buy
in sufficient quantities.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So, today, instead of
developing a product

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and going and trying
to sell it, what you do

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
is you come up with
a product idea.

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You say, this is
a great product.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
This could really help people
to improve their life or work

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:22.040 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So you start off with what
is called product discovery.

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
What is my idea for the
product and how would it

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.370 align:middle line:90%
help my customers.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you go and
you engage in what

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.700 align:middle line:90%
is called customer discovery.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Is this the sort
of product that you

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.744 align:middle line:84%
would buy and pay for and use
in your life or your work?

01:05:37.744 --> 01:05:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell you, and
you keep going back and forth.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's like two
iterative feedback loops.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Product development,
customer development,

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
product development, until it
clicks and the customers say,

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I want that.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I want that now.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, bang, you
have an iPhone 1

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:56.570 align:middle line:84%
sells 50 million copies, sells
more than all of Microsoft

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
in that entire year and drives
the company toward becoming

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
the most profitable company
in the history of the world

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
because they're
absolutely crystal

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
clear about what
customers wanted when they

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.910 align:middle line:90%
brought the product to market.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.659 align:middle line:84%
And all they did was
announce the product.

01:06:09.659 --> 01:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And you remember,
people were lined up

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
around the corner,
sleeping on the streets,

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.480 align:middle line:90%
to buy the product.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.284 align:middle line:84%
They knew that this
product, basically,

01:06:17.284 --> 01:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to help them achieve goals,
communicate with their friends

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and relatives, solved a problem,
having everything in one place,

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
did a job for them,
enabled them to communicate

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
at higher, faster,
better levels,

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
get emails, send message.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it did all of those
things simultaneously.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
It answered every single
thing that we're talking about

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.321 align:middle line:84%
and became a
marketing phenomenon.

01:06:36.321 --> 01:06:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So the last question I'd
like to ask is, in your opinion,

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
what are personal behaviors
are required for success

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.820 align:middle line:90%
in business and in life?

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Focus is the most
important quality for success.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
If you can focus, you can
succeed at almost anything.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot focus, you cannot
succeed at anything today that

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.736 align:middle line:84%
is so complex and
requires focus.

01:06:55.736 --> 01:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You'll always have to work
for someone else who can

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.760 align:middle line:90%
focus and make you focus.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask, what
are the three words,

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
my favorite word
starts with clarity--

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
clarity, I think,
is 95% of success.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Clarity needs to
know, first of all,

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
who you are, what you want,
what you really care about,

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
what are you good
at, what can you

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
be good at, what makes
you happy, where do you

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.960 align:middle line:90%
want to put your whole heart.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Many people get into something
that they are successful

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
at but never very successful
because their heart isn't

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.130 align:middle line:90%
into it.

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, be
clear about who you are.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, be
clear about your goals.

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I teach goal setting to
people all over the world,

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and they come back to me
and they say, you know,

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that goal setting
it made me rich.

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It changed my life
because before that, I

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
was doing this and
that, and then I

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.554 align:middle line:84%
had clear goals and written
plans and priorities.

01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I work on them
every day, and you'll

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
accomplish more in a year
with clear written goals that

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
are in harmony
with who you really

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
are inside than you might
accomplish in five or 10 years.

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.410 align:middle line:84%
All success comes
from task completion.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It comes from goal achievement.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you are not focused in
an orderly way, disciplined,

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
with priorities, focused
on achieving your goals

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and completing your
tasks, you have no chance,

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.919 align:middle line:90%
you have no chance at all.

01:08:12.919 --> 01:08:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So number one is clarity.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Number two is focus--

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.660 align:middle line:90%
focus, focus.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:17.960 align:middle line:90%
You can't do many things.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You can do one thing, and
do one thing at a time.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And the third is concentration.

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:25.359 align:middle line:84%
And just concentrate single
mindedly on one thing at a time

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:26.569 align:middle line:90%
until it's done.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So my three favorite words-- and
you can write a book on this--

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
just clarity, focus,
and concentration.

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But remember this I'll just
repeat what I just said.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.550 align:middle line:84%
All of success in life comes
from starting and completing

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.689 align:middle line:90%
tasks.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:42.939 align:middle line:84%
And successful people are
those who start and complete

01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
more important tasks
and complete them sooner

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and complete them better.

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:50.439 align:middle line:84%
So your job is
always to learn how

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.779 align:middle line:84%
to complete more
and more important

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.939 align:middle line:84%
tasks faster and at a
higher level of quality.

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is more important
to you in success,

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
no matter what your job or
work is, than anything else

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.200 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Clarity, focus,
and concentration.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.560 align:middle line:90%

Brian Tracy is so smart.

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:45.340 align:middle line:90%

>> It's a pleasure to meet
you and to have you here.

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to be sharing with
you first the keys of courage,

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.780 align:middle line:90%
staying with my parents' story.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.400 align:middle line:84%
My parents grew up basically
during the Vietnamese War,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.527 align:middle line:84%
and they were raised in
the South part of Vietnam.

01:10:05.527 --> 01:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for
them at that time,

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
they had the freedom
to choose their life

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and to be who they wanted.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
They had a good business,
in the tire business,

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and they were
having a good life,

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and they enjoyed it very
much until 1975, when Vietnam

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
was united under one
government, and they were forced

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.320 align:middle line:90%
to stop their whole business.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
They had to make the
decision because they

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
were seeing neighbors in the
middle of the night getting--

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
taken away from their
homes and disappearing.

01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And for them,
freedom was too much

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
of a treasure and
too precious for them

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to just live that kind of life
in fear and in uncertainty.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that was a
very touching moment

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.740 align:middle line:84%
when I heard it here that
they chose to run in the fear

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.460 align:middle line:90%
and not knowing what to do.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But in going through
that ring of fire

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with the
uncertainty on the other side

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
was so much bliss, so much
happiness, and so much freedom.

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I only had heard bits
and pieces of it,

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:07.220 align:middle line:84%
but when I finally heard
the entire story, the key

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:10.200 align:middle line:84%
of appreciation really
hit me because it's

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
been to that point, I
had no understanding

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.370 align:middle line:90%
of what I wanted to do.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
When I heard that,
a seed was planted

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
in me to make me
feel like, OK, it's

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%
time for me to step up
and appreciate and show

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
my parents that I want
to give back to them.

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to show them the love
and appreciation that they

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:29.640 align:middle line:90%
did for me.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I opened up my own
paralegal firm,

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and, yeah, and from then on,
I became very successful.

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was driven
to be successful.

01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I was working seven days a
week, 24 hours I was on call.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But the more I was becoming
successful and the more

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
money I was making,
the more I realized

01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that I was becoming
unhappy, and you're not

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
passionate about
life, and you're not

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
passionate about things.

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with
people who were injured.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to help
them the best I could.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to be
the best professional,

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and because I understand
building relationships,

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
your customers are
your best referral.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But in sympathizing
for them, I took on

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.520 align:middle line:90%
all their negative emotions.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I took on the clients that
kept calling about wanting

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to commit suicide.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I kept getting
calls about people

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that were so
frustrated, so angry

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
with their pain and the
agony and the situation

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that they were dealing
with, but I'd never

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
understood that by
sympathizing and trying

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to help them feel their pain, I
was attracting their negativity

01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to me, and I was
starting to experience

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that in my own reality.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't passionate about the
business, but it made me money,

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to
buy things with it.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do great things in
terms of physical possessions.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I was able to have a nice
car, but I was not happy.

01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Money never gave
me the happiness.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I fell into a very,
very deep depression.

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And I struggled
very long and hard

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.480 align:middle line:84%
with what was my
purpose in life.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
During that time that I had
completely fallen apart,

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I had received
two amazing gifts,

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and the first one was love.

01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I had amazing friends
who kept reaching out,

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and my parents were
always there for me.

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But because I still
had that feeling

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of love and that connection to
the world, the physical world

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
as we see it, I was still
willing to live and be here

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
with all of you and survive
because when you feel

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
loved and you understand
how powerful it is.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, the saying goes, love
is the most powerful force

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.670 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So my second blessing
was personal development.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Through personal
development, I also

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
learned that your thoughts
and your imagination,

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
your ability to think,
which is God given gift

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to us that no one else
has, is so treasured.

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And through that, I learned that
even though physically I was

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
defeated, I can think and I
can imagine anything I want.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Even though physically I
was not in a good place,

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.632 align:middle line:84%
I was able to put myself
by closing my eyes

01:14:07.632 --> 01:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and imagine that
I could put myself

01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:10.470 align:middle line:90%
in anywhere in the world.

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I can put myself
on the nicest beach

01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and with the most amazing
person I want, with my family.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine the amazing
loving feelings, the bliss,

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:22.620 align:middle line:84%
the happiness, the joy that
everyone wants to experience.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that happiness
is actually the highest level

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.690 align:middle line:90%
of success, and it's not money.

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you focus on
the amazing things

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that you have in your life and
the amazing experiences you've

01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:37.630 align:middle line:84%
experienced, you will
create more of that.

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you focus on all
the horror and terror

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:43.260 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the
news and TV and focus

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
on all the unfortunate
things that

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
happen and are part
of our reality,

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
then, yes, you will create that
as well because that's just

01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
the law of attraction.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's just how it works.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense to me.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.930 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for sharing with us.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.920 align:middle line:90%

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, this is
Dr. Alfredo Besosa.

01:15:17.907 --> 01:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to help me?

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so.

01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, he's going to help you
in a very special way today.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Besosa is going to offer you
the map to your inner journey.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That's not what
I was expecting.

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go over here and sit
down and listen to what he has

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
to say.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:15:36.222 --> 01:15:38.160 align:middle line:90%


01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth I'm here to
help with the key of harmony,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.790 align:middle line:84%
which is a very important key
for me because it's the one

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
that will open the doors
of happiness for you.

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you
that harmony means balance.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So before everything,
I want you to know

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
how did you get to this
point of your life.

01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:03.150 align:middle line:84%
This point, you're
suffering a lot,

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of
peoples in our world.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:09.870 align:middle line:84%
In the world, there are like
50% of couples getting apart,

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:13.030 align:middle line:90%
like 85% of people with stress.

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So we need desperately
the key of harmony.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.060 align:middle line:90%
So how did you get here?

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
The process is
something like this.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Something happened to us
in the world something

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
happens, and then we think
something about that.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
That thought generates
a feeling, an emotion,

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and then you act, and
that's how we manage life.

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Something happens, we
think, we feel, and we act.

01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that there's
like three bodies on us--

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
physical body, emotional
body, and our mental body.

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we have all
these emotions here,

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
you're going to affect our body.

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying mind
body medicine for a while,

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and let me tell you that 85% of
diseases are because of that.

01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to guide you
to the process of heal

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:02.970 align:middle line:90%
to the key of harmony.

01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to
manage your emotions.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
To manage your emotions,
you have to take them out.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to clean yourself
and find inner peace.

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:14.800 align:middle line:90%
How do you work that?

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Is like going to an
emotional bathroom.

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when you don't
go to the bathroom

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and you stay like
this, you get sick.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
If you manage your
emotions between them

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to the other people, you
damage your relationships.

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So what do we have to
do with our emotions?

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to take them
out, clean ourselves.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.320 align:middle line:90%
What's the second step?

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
The second step to get harmony
is to raise your energy.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can exercise, maybe
do some yoga, tai chi,

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and go to nature, even have
sex, have a massage done.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So with all of
these things, you're

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.450 align:middle line:90%
going to raise your harmony.

01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
From there, with
enough energy, you

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:05.800 align:middle line:84%
can change the way you think,
which is the next step.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
To change the way we think, we
have to put the key of harmony

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
in our relationship
with the universe.

01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So to balance that
relationship, we're

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
going to find out
how is a role in life

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and what's the role
of life with us.

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:22.740 align:middle line:90%
We are all trying to be happy.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we do,
sometimes we don't.

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So what are we doing
in the process?

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.480 align:middle line:84%
What we are doing is
learning how to be happy.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.850 align:middle line:90%
So what's the purpose of life?

01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Learning to be happy.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So if we know that, that the
problem is that life is giving

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
us, like in your cage or disease
or maybe when somebody is broke

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
or when somebody who's
got a bad relationship,

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
what's the problem
with the problem?

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
No problem with the problem
because it's just something

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that you have to learn
how to solve in order

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.980 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to be happy.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So now you know, the universe
is giving me the lessons,

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and I am the student.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.990 align:middle line:90%
You balance that relationship.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to
balance the relationship

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.510 align:middle line:90%
between you and yourself.

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Now how do you balance that?

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that you know
that you're here

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to be happy, what
you have to do is take yourself

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.780 align:middle line:90%
and made you happy.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It seems logical,
but all the time, we

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
think that we have to do only
work or work for the family

01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of things that
we don't think in ourself.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have to do.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:33.700 align:middle line:90%
We are here to be happy.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So I have to work for
me, for my own happiness,

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and I have to have a clear
vision of what happiness means.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Happiness means five things--

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
inner peace, harmonic
relationships,

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.760 align:middle line:90%
health, wealth, and joy.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to think for my inner
peace, my health, my wealth,

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.860 align:middle line:90%
my joy.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I have to talk through
these five results.

01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I have to add to that.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
I have to take me there.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we think that
we have to serve others

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and that we are here
only to serve others,

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
but when we want
to serve others,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.550 align:middle line:90%
we want them to be happy.

01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't know
how to be happy,

01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to teach them?

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The third step is
I'm going to balance

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.272 align:middle line:90%
my relationship with others.

01:20:23.272 --> 01:20:24.480 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm going to ask.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So how do I balance
these relationships?

01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:29.860 align:middle line:90%
How I put this in harmony?

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
is to love them.

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
To love them, what does it mean?

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to understand them,
and I'm going to accept them.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to understand that as
myself, they're here learning.

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And the way to learn
is make mistakes.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So I had the right
to make mistakes.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I learn.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.100 align:middle line:84%
They have the right
to make mistakes.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.510 align:middle line:90%
And here's a clue.

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
When somebody makes
a mistake with me,

01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I have to learn from that.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And imagine a person that is
doing that, the person that

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
is managing his or her emotions,
then is rising the energy,

01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:13.320 align:middle line:84%
then is understanding his
relationship with the universe,

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
being a student,
taking life lesson,

01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and then walking
through his happiness

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in order to serve others
and serve himself.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And with the people,
what he is doing

01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
is loving and making agreements.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
When you're a person
like that, my dear,

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.920 align:middle line:84%
you become a person from
God to the universe,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and then the universe becomes
a present from God to you.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:42.432 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

01:21:42.432 --> 01:21:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, doctor.

01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:47.388 align:middle line:84%
I know you helped
Elizabeth immensely.

01:21:47.388 --> 01:21:48.188 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

01:21:48.188 --> 01:21:49.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

01:21:49.186 --> 01:21:51.681 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:21:51.681 --> 01:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%


01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to have a
few words with Goldie.

01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Goldie?

01:21:59.770 --> 01:22:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to take
Elizabeth to meet the council.

01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:03.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going in for the big close.

01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay.

01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm pretty sure
she's going to join us,

01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:11.230 align:middle line:84%
so I want you to go ahead and
tell them to prepare for her

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:12.400 align:middle line:90%
arrival.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Let them know that I want it to
be an incredible celebration.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:16.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Now if Elizabeth
accepts the job,

01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
do I get to intern with her?

01:22:21.230 --> 01:22:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, darling.

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:23.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay.

01:22:23.311 --> 01:22:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Say good bye.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye, Elizabeth.

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.580 align:middle line:10%
It was great spending
the day with you.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure I'll be
seeing you again very soon.

01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even sooner than you know.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Boy, that Goldie sure is
something else, isn't she?

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, she is.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry I didn't
meet her sooner.

01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if maybe she'd
moved my sofa few years ago

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.710 align:middle line:90%
if I'd even be here now.

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, you're right
where you're supposed to be.

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Are you starting
to see that now?

01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I suppose so.

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:53.680 align:middle line:90%
It's ironic though, Gwen.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I've given so many
uplifting speeches

01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and inspirational
talks to groups before,

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and now it's all
coming back to me.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that when
it's about us, all that rah,

01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.110 align:middle line:90%
rah just goes out the window.

01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
What you're feeling
now is the key

01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
of empathy, one of the
most important keys of all.

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Because empathy helps us to
feel compassion or sympathy

01:23:19.770 --> 01:23:23.070 align:middle line:84%
for other people who
are facing challenges.

01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And without the key
of empathy, this world

01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
would be a very cold
and lonely place.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Gwen, I appreciate everything
you've shared with me about

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the keys, but nobody's answered
my biggest question yet.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Why am I going to die?

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't exactly
been a health nut,

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:44.340 align:middle line:84%
but I've taken really good care
of myself, better than most.

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.480 align:middle line:90%
I never smoked.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't drink sodas or eat
things doctors tell you not

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:49.990 align:middle line:90%
to eat.

01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I've exercised, and I'm
a pretty happy person.

01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not negative or angry,
and I don't understand.

01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:00.300 align:middle line:90%
My grandma lived to be 101.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's been
like months since I've

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.420 align:middle line:90%
had a bagel or potato chips.

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I just don't understand.

01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:07.930 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
reason I can think

01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:09.730 align:middle line:90%
of that I would be dying now.

01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:11.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really, what the hell?

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> People get sick for a
lot of different reasons.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.950 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of factors.

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not just lifestyle.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There's also genetics,
there's the environment,

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and there's destiny.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, it remains
one of life's mysteries.

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But I will assure
you, Elizabeth,

01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that it is the quality of your
years on Earth that count.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you've taken
such good care of yourself,

01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:41.810 align:middle line:84%
you've honored your physical
and spiritual bodies.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
You always try to
be kind and loving.

01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You took amazing
care of your animals.

01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
You were more than generous with
all your friends and family.

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
All of this means that you
have lived a very good life,

01:24:57.650 --> 01:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
even if it doesn't
turn out to be for as

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.020 align:middle line:90%
long as you'd hoped for.

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, tomorrow--
tomorrow's promised to no one,

01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have
to embrace each day

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and make the most of it.

01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:17.420 align:middle line:84%
All these positive aspects
of the life that you've just

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
lived, they promise you a future
more beautiful than anything

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.420 align:middle line:90%
you could ever imagine.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And you will be
remembered forever,

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, in the minds and
the hearts of everyone who's

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.492 align:middle line:90%
life you've touched.

01:25:32.492 --> 01:25:33.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But from now on, I think
I'm going to eat more cake.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, deal.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.130 align:middle line:90%


01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Look, Elizabeth it's
our cosmic rock stars,

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.016 align:middle line:90%
also known as the council.

01:25:49.016 --> 01:25:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't have any shoes on.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.360 align:middle line:90%
How come they're in socks?

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a visible metaphor.

01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:57.536 align:middle line:90%
We're here to sock it to you.

01:25:57.536 --> 01:26:02.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth, I want you
to meet Dannion Brinkley.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Dannion.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Don Miguel Ruiz.

01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you do?

01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And Michael Bernard Beckwith.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Michael.

01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you again.

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Again.

01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And, Elizabeth, you've had a
very interesting and full day.

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I think we should sit down
and talk about it because each

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
of us has a story to tell you
that's much like the story

01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:29.792 align:middle line:84%
and the experience
you're going through now.

01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. that would be great.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's hurry because I can't
wait to tell you my story.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you're going to
answer lots of your questions.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sock it to me.

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You've been telling that
joke for 18,000 years.

01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:40.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Always worked.

01:26:40.451 --> 01:26:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You must be overwhelmed
by all the things that have

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.900 align:middle line:90%
happened today.

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.751 align:middle line:84%
You've made so many
powerful experts,

01:26:46.751 --> 01:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
plus I really
appreciate what you've

01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:50.020 align:middle line:84%
gone through in
terms of receiving

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.630 align:middle line:90%
that news from the doctor.

01:26:51.630 --> 01:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you can't imagine what
I'm going through right now.

01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, honey, we really do.

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We all have these kinds
of experiences before.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But before I get going,
I have something here.

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a key, and this
is a key of life.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's
what you really are.

01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:19.111 align:middle line:90%
You're life.

01:27:19.111 --> 01:27:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, this is gorgeous.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Can I put out now?

01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.690 align:middle line:90%
It's yours already.

01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.690 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.090 align:middle line:90%
This is from all of you?

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh it's beautiful.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all of
you, it's only one.

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.110 align:middle line:90%
We are the same.

01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Just an illusion you see
three different people.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> We are really the same.

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And not just that,
we're also you.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we
understand how you feel.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I have a major heart
attack not that long ago.

01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I was nine weeks in a coma.

01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I got
back from that coma,

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I have great news
for my doctors.

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.690 align:middle line:84%
They say, if you're
lucky, you're

01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
going to live one more
year, maybe two more years,

01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
but you no longer can do
whatever you did before.

01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Forget about teaching,
lectures, et cetera, et cetera,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:18.930 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay at
home, watching TV.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I talk to my children,
and I tell them,

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:28.910 align:middle line:84%
there is no way that we stay
at home waiting for death.

01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I will do what I love to
do with the key of passion,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.780 align:middle line:90%
enjoying every single moment.

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And when the day comes
for me, I will be ready.

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
At a time, I didn't know my
body was already dead, just

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.640 align:middle line:90%
like your body is dead already.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Why I had to be afraid to die.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
We are life.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We are the first
who moves our body.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:01.350 align:middle line:84%
We are moving not just our
body, every single atom,

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:03.720 align:middle line:84%
every molecule, everything
that you can see

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.860 align:middle line:90%
is moved by us, including you.

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean the three
of you or all of us?

01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>> All of us.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, all life.

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> All of life.

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Life is only one,
and everything is alive.

01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Only matter and life exists.

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Like my adorable friend
says, matter only

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
can be moved when I
first move matter.

01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Without a force matter
just cannot move.

01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Then the truth is so simple.

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a binary system.

01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The force which is
life, and matter that

01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:44.940 align:middle line:90%
is moving by the force.

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Energy cannot be destroyed, only
transform, and that is life.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.120 align:middle line:90%
We are the energy, we are life.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.810 align:middle line:84%
We are eternal,
but not our bodies.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We welcome you in this
society of the keys holders.

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael, many days
like this, I mean,

01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:14.280 align:middle line:84%
how am I supposed to have
faith when I have so little

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.030 align:middle line:90%
to believe in?

01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the perfect place
to start, with nothing.

01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
That's where faith comes from.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You have an inner feeling right
now that you want to go on.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Now that inner
feeling right there,

01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:28.720 align:middle line:90%
that's the beginning of faith.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The beginning a faith that
then grows into conviction.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So having nothing, because
everything comes out

01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of nothing, you're beginning
in the right place.

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you
about a lucid dream

01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I had that literally
changed my life,

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that was the precursor
to faith for me.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I
had this lucid dream,

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and I had it for over a
year, it's same dream almost

01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:55.360 align:middle line:90%
every night.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.270 align:middle line:84%
These men were chasing me, and
every night, I would wake up

01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:59.900 align:middle line:90%
before they would catch me.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But every night, they
got a little bit closer.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And then one night,
I said to myself,

01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:08.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stop running.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:12.649 align:middle line:84%
I turned around, and there
was really small tent,

01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:14.940 align:middle line:84%
all these people are trying
to go into this small tent.

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a very long line, and
I knew every single person

01:31:18.010 --> 01:31:19.240 align:middle line:90%
in this line.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to myself,
these man can't hurt me,

01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I have all my friends here.

01:31:23.290 --> 01:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, these people
turned their back on me.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Two of the men grabbed
me and held me down.

01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The other plunged a
knife into my heart.

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
The pain was
excruciating and I died.

01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up, I
could see the substance

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:44.260 align:middle line:90%
of beauty and of love.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
called it love beauty.

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.060 align:middle line:84%
My name for the
presence, my name for God

01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
was love beauty because
the love and the beauty

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
was everywhere in animate
and inanimate objects.

01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Totally shifted my life.

01:31:57.550 --> 01:32:02.350 align:middle line:84%
The pain was real, the death was
real, but I awakened to a whole

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.180 align:middle line:90%
another way of seeing.

01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.380 align:middle line:90%
I was transformed.

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a heart
attack that I can say,

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
but it was an awakening,
and it was the beginning

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.130 align:middle line:90%
of what we would call faith.

01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It was beginning of a faith,
which is classically defined--

01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:18.740 align:middle line:90%
it's a living substance.

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the substance
of things hoped for,

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence
of things not seen.

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
talking about faith,

01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:29.420 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
seeing the invisible.

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
hearing the inaudible.

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
living substance that

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is beyond what you can see.

01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond the form,
it's beyond the matter.

01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:42.140 align:middle line:90%
It's life itself.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, this desire
within you to go on,

01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that's the beginning
of faith, you see.

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
feel that things

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
are going to be OK,
even if you don't know

01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:52.870 align:middle line:90%
how they're going to be OK.

01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:55.150 align:middle line:90%
That feeling is faith.

01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to
establish a spiritual community

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
while on Earth, and
there was a moment

01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:05.440 align:middle line:84%
in which the building
we were using

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
for our spiritual gatherings
was no longer available to us.

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had to temporarily
find housing in hotels

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.060 align:middle line:84%
while we were
refurbishing the building

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.740 align:middle line:90%
we were going to occupy.

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And we were under a
tremendous challenge

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:24.520 align:middle line:84%
because I was seeking
to keep my staff on,

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.830 align:middle line:84%
we were paying to have
the building refurbished,

01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
plus we were paying the
rent on the building,

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:30.910 align:middle line:90%
plus we were renting the hotel.

01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Money was running out,
and time was running out

01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:36.040 align:middle line:90%
on our conditional use permit.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we were up against the
proverbial wall, so to speak.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So I called the board
meeting, and there

01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:43.800 align:middle line:90%
were two flyers on the table.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
One flyer said, Agape, which
was the name of my community,

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:52.490 align:middle line:84%
will be temporarily suspended,
and the other flyer said,

01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Agape will be open
at this new location

01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
at this particular date.

01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So I put both of the
flyers on the table,

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and I went around
the room and I said,

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is it possible for us
to generate enough money

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and to complete this project
before our conditional use

01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:12.010 align:middle line:90%
permit runs out?

01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And they all started speaking
about it's almost impossible,

01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:16.280 align:middle line:90%
we don't have any money.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were beginning
to yammer about that,

01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and I said, please.

01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you one question

01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and the question is yes or no.

01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I went around the room.

01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.510 align:middle line:90%
First person said, yes, but--

01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:27.570 align:middle line:90%
no, but.

01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:29.320 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep our
butts out of her mouth

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.170 align:middle line:90%
because that's bad anatomy.

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:33.820 align:middle line:90%
That's bad anatomy.

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.130 align:middle line:90%
So I said no butts.

01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm just asking
you, is it possible.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's possible.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The next board member,
yes, it's possible.

01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Went all around the room
until every single person

01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:47.200 align:middle line:84%
in the room, even the contractor
who was in this meeting

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.470 align:middle line:90%
said yes, it's possible.

01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want you to
do one thing for me.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't let anything enter into
your mind for this next week.

01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Just hang in the possibility
and let's see what happens.

01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, the
contractor called, and he said,

01:35:02.410 --> 01:35:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I was so moved by
that meeting, I'm

01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
going to double
the manpower, I'm

01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:08.591 align:middle line:84%
going to have a group of
people that work at night,

01:35:08.591 --> 01:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and have a group of people
that work in the day.

01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to pay for some
of it out of my own pocket

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
because I have faith
that you guys are

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:18.020 align:middle line:90%
going to come through this.

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
We had put in for a
non-collateral bank

01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:23.540 align:middle line:90%
loan of approximately $400,000.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.100 align:middle line:90%
No collateral.

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.380 align:middle line:90%
We were a young community.

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the loan officer
was working on our account.

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:34.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the bank owners
looked over his shoulder

01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and said, what are
you working on?

01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm working on this
non-collateral loan for Agape.

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the owners of
the bank said, Beckwith?

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Give him the money.

01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So within a few days, we had
more than enough manpower,

01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:50.480 align:middle line:84%
more than enough
money, and the flyer

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that we had chosen to put
out was a flyer that said,

01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Agape will open its doors
on this particular day.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you?

01:35:58.100 --> 01:35:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But the walls were bare,
the floor wasn't quite done,

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
but we celebrated as if it was
the biggest thing in the world,

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and we had that faith.

01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:10.160 align:middle line:90%
That became conviction.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.510 align:middle line:84%
We took the butt out of the
mouth, got the anatomy perfect,

01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we're
inviting you to be about.

01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:18.874 align:middle line:84%
>> The bottom line
is, my situation,

01:36:18.874 --> 01:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I know you talk about life and
death like I've never heard

01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:25.610 align:middle line:84%
anyone talk about it, but I
just have a little trouble with

01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:28.970 align:middle line:84%
the key of faith, knowing that
I'm not going to be around much

01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:31.580 align:middle line:90%
longer.

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that you're
facing this day and what

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at from hearing
from the doctor is about

01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:41.570 align:middle line:84%
something that we
understand as inevitability.

01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You come here leaving,
but we have a privilege.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.540 align:middle line:84%
We've all been to
the other side.

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen
that part of reality.

01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of seeing
that part of reality,

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
the greatest thing
that we can talk about,

01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:59.480 align:middle line:84%
or I can talk to you about,
is the key of appreciation.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.970 align:middle line:84%
To appreciate every
moment that you

01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:05.720 align:middle line:84%
had before you got the phone
call, to appreciate the phone

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
call, and to appreciate
the key of where

01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
you go from here,
because this becomes

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
the most important
thing about appreciating

01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:16.850 align:middle line:90%
what your life is about.

01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Appreciating what brought you
to this stage in your life

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and what you're going
to do because you're

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.860 align:middle line:90%
at this stage of your life.

01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:28.670 align:middle line:84%
One glorious day, I was
talking on the telephone

01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and was struck by lightning
and declared clinically dead.

01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:34.460 align:middle line:10%
>> So when you look at
what you're going through,

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.550 align:middle line:10%
you're listening to people
who have had experiences much

01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:40.700 align:middle line:10%
the same as yours, whose
understanding brought them

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:45.620 align:middle line:10%
deeper into understanding and
who also allowed us to come

01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:48.960 align:middle line:10%
to help you so you
can help others.

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.840 align:middle line:10%
I was sitting holding
the phone, lightning

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.230 align:middle line:10%
came down the phone line,
it went down my spine,

01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.885 align:middle line:10%
Welded the nails of the heels
of my shoes to the floor.

01:37:56.885 --> 01:37:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Threw me in the air,
suspended me in the air,

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and threw me back
down on the bed.

01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It took me two years to learn
to walk and feed myself.

01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Dead for 28 minutes, completely
paralyzed for six days,

01:38:07.190 --> 01:38:10.010 align:middle line:84%
partially paralyzed for
seven months, two years

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:12.080 align:middle line:90%
to walk and feed myself.

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So we understand where
you are because we've been

01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:17.750 align:middle line:90%
in these kind of situations.

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:20.990 align:middle line:10%
We've all seen that
other side, and what

01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:27.020 align:middle line:10%
that makes me is an NDE-er it
means near-death experience.

01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that makes sense.

01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It means a person who's
experienced what other

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:35.240 align:middle line:84%
dimensions and other frequencies
and other harmonies that are

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.530 align:middle line:84%
keys to putting together
this universe as we know it.

01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:41.810 align:middle line:90%
We represent that part.

01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We represent a part that
functions in both sides.

01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:48.720 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing, but
also what you're feeling.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Think about when you were
holding the phone to your ear,

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.170 align:middle line:90%
what you were feeling.

01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling
brought us here today.

01:38:57.930 --> 01:38:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So what really
becomes important,

01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, are the
secrets of the keys.

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And by embracing
each of those keys,

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.060 align:middle line:84%
you can call upon guardians and
gods, messengers, and angels,

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that they wait for
you to recognize

01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that divine spiritual power,
that divine living power that

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
moves through you so that
you can, in gratitude, be

01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:23.700 align:middle line:90%
of service.

01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:26.880 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have this situation
happen to you like each of us

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
has described the situation that
happened to us if you were not

01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
one that had been
chosen to help others

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
deal with this kind of crisis
that comes in their life.

01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So whether you
realize it or not,

01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:43.440 align:middle line:84%
while we all sit
here and grin, as you

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:49.140 align:middle line:84%
have been gifted a reward
from the conversation

01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:53.010 align:middle line:84%
with your doctor, which
terrified you, frightened you,

01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:55.860 align:middle line:84%
created all that doubt,
that pain, that loss,

01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.540 align:middle line:90%
that anger that comes.

01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was a gift,
because from that place,

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:06.120 align:middle line:84%
knowing you have us,
the funny messengers--

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
messengers of humor and
laughter and gaiety.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the key of courage
becomes important this time

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
because as surely
as we all sit here,

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.130 align:middle line:84%
there will be someone that
will come into your life

01:40:20.130 --> 01:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that you as a messenger will
have to instill courage, faith,

01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:28.080 align:middle line:84%
passion, and appreciation
in their life

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.890 align:middle line:84%
so that they can move
forward just like we are here

01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:33.692 align:middle line:90%
to help you move forward.

01:40:33.692 --> 01:40:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be really nice
to be able to help people when

01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:38.140 align:middle line:90%
they need it the most.

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Do I hear thunder?

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's why we're here.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:41.854 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ready
to say, I want to--

01:40:41.854 --> 01:40:42.764 align:middle line:90%
can we trade seats.

01:40:42.764 --> 01:40:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be next to Dannion

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.140 align:middle line:84%
when wind, thunder, and
lightning is about to happen.

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.390 align:middle line:90%
You sit next to him this time.

01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:50.006 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll do it, but I will
not hold it from you.

01:40:50.006 --> 01:40:52.071 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:52.071 --> 01:40:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, gentlemen.

01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So much.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I am so inspired by your
stories, and I am so grateful.

01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm really feeling the
key of appreciation

01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:04.210 align:middle line:84%
for you coming here to help me
with this challenge in my life.

01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It is our joy, and that
key is infused with a lot

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.500 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And love.

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And remember, becoming
the keys is the mission,

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:23.170 align:middle line:84%
not just to be knowing the
keys, but to become the keys.

01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Gwen, that was
really something else.

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The men of the
council are brilliant.

01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I have to agree.

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you smell that?

01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course I do.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Cinnamon, vanilla,
sugar, fresh baked cakes.

01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It's heavenly, isn't it?

01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Speaking of heaven--

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I know what
you're thinking.

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, you're
still very much alive,

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Just checking.

01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:50.550 align:middle line:90%
It's been quite a day.

01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Sit here with me.

01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:55.530 align:middle line:84%
The time has come for you
to make your decision.

01:41:55.530 --> 01:41:59.010 align:middle line:84%
As you know, we want
to make you an offer.

01:41:59.010 --> 01:42:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity
for you to help others,

01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:04.980 align:middle line:84%
much like how I've
helped you today.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, every
once in a while, we

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
get an opportunity to
recruit new guides.

01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this a very long
time and I'm ready to move on,

01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:20.820 align:middle line:90%
but I picked you out myself.

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been watching
you for some time,

01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and I think you'd be excellent
at helping other people to see

01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:30.660 align:middle line:84%
all they have to be grateful for
and to help them find solutions

01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:32.530 align:middle line:90%
for their problems.

01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:36.810 align:middle line:84%
We encourage people to be more,
to be kinder to one another,

01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:38.430 align:middle line:84%
to take better
care of themselves

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and their fellow human beings,
to do more with their lives.

01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I think this is something
you could do, don't you?

01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's why I became
a motivational speaker

01:42:49.230 --> 01:42:52.040 align:middle line:84%
