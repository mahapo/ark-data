What did you experience,
and what does it reflect?

Does it really reflect
a different experience,

a fundamental different
aspect of the universe,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%

quinoa, 1 by 1 by 1 millimeter,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
cutting it into
30-nanometer thin slices--

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
25,000 of them-- at the
level of electron microscopy,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and then using modern
machine-learning techniques

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
where it can automatically
reconstruct the precise wiring.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Because in this piece
of quinoa grain,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
there are roughly 50,000
cells, and there's

a few kilometers of wiring.

neuron is wired to which,

At this point, it is not

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
you can distinguish whether it's
a human brain or mouse brain.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And the point I would make that
the basic hardware of all of us

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:90%
is the same.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether we are a
mouse or dog or monkey

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
or human or whale, at this
level, it's all very similar.

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And in each brain is
unique and different,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and you can go back
to a famous example

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to consciousness
that Leibniz made in his mill

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
examples 350 years
ago because he said

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you can never find
consciousness and even

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:90%
if you go into a mill--

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that was his analogy
at the time--

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and you zoom in inside the
mill, you see not nothing

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.622 align:middle line:90%
but levers moving.

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are things in here
with respect to consciousness,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
you go inside, you see,
well, where is consciousness.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't see consciousness.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I see synapses, and
I see mechanisms.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the point of Leibniz,
all of these mechanisms.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.383 align:middle line:84%

emerges consciousness.

Very much so.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, I was
very much a scientist.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I love science.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%

00:17:50.322 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm a scientist
ultimately because I

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:84%
do believe that by
rational process,

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
we can understand what this
universe is made out of

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and what we made out
of and why we're here.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I grew
up as a devout believer,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.538 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to reconcile those
obviously conflicting things

00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:90%

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, I thought,
well, consciousness science

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.395 align:middle line:84%
is going to not be able
to explain that finally,

00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and then finally I
have a justification

for why I believe in a soul.

it more and more

00:18:18.113 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%

more and more, I said no.

We have plenty of data to show

And when I just placed real
water at one end of the maze,

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
the pea grew its root straight
to it, which is not surprising

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
because they use the
humidity gradient to detect

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and design a
playback experiment,

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
so I actually recorded the
sound of water in the pipe

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and I played it
back by attaching

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:84%
a little speaker, a
vibration speaker,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:84%
in an iPod, which would play
back the sound of water.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is
that the peas would also

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
be able to find the source
of water through the sound

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
even when water really
is nowhere to be found.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:90%

to set up the EPG,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:84%

the EEG, for the little pea.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

There he is.

What are you doing?

00:25:12.904 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not touching it.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:90%

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So one of the experiments I did
is testing Pavlovian learning

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in plants, specifically peas,
and it's following pretty much

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the same testing protocol
that we use in animals

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and specifically the Pavlovian
protocol with the dog.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of Pavlov, he
used a bell, which was always

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
preceding the arrival of
dinner, and in response to that,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
the dog will
salivate because it's

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
very excited about
the arrival of dinner.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But repeating these
long enough or times

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
enough, the bell on
his own, even when

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
there is no dinner coming,
will make the dog salivate.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Now plants don't salivate,
and I didn't use a bell.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
But instead of a bell,
I used a little fan.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
dinner, I used light.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Now this is actually blue
light because the peas really

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they do, a blue
light, they go towards it.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:90%
So they bend.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:84%
If you repeat
these enough times,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
in this case for
three days, you will

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
find that the fan alone
without the light even arriving

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:84%
will make the pea bend
in the right direction.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
The fan didn't mean anything,
but the plant somehow

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
has learned the association
between these two,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and just like the dog, the
pea is passing the test

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.795 align:middle line:90%
with flying colors.

00:27:21.795 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:90%

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
My first experiment was
received with great resistance

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
because it was
really the first one

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to show that, yeah,
plants can learn,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and they can tick all
the same boxes that we

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:90%
would expect from an animal.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
comments that I received

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
were never about the
data, which is the--

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that's the foundation
of science.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like nobody ever
actually said to me

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:90%
you did this experiment wrong.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:90%

this cannot be.

There is the concept, even the
idea that a plant could learn,

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:90%
it was almost disturbing.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So what is it about
brain and neurons

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that is so special that without
them you can be conscious?

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
What brain and neurons
are really doing

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.850 align:middle line:84%
is passing through signals
of electrical nature.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, plants are really good
at electrical signaling.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So does that mean the
plants are more conscious?

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
have more genes that

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
are coding for that kind
of exchange of information

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
internally, so does
it mean that they

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:84%
are even better than we are at
this consciousness business?

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
They are doing all
of the things that we

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
think you can only do if you
do have a brain in neurons,

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:90%

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:32.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the common features of
this decreased sense of self

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is just a greater openness and
a greater freedom of choice.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that emerges
from psychedelics.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It emerges in meditation because
one of the characteristics

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.830 align:middle line:84%
is an open mindedness and a
freedom from habitual response,

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and it looks very
much like patterns

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that we see in childhood before
those narratives get locked in

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of
self gets locked in.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:05.755 align:middle line:84%
So this openness has huge
implications for healing.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Why would something
synthesized by mushrooms

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.730 align:middle line:84%
do something so dramatic
to the human brain?

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, what does it
do was the question in part,

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and I participated
about 10 years ago

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:46.040 align:middle line:84%
in a study which gave a small
number of subjects like me

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.590 align:middle line:84%
various concentrations
of psilocybin

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.720 align:middle line:84%
in a very controlled
environment in which we

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:84%
were coached to be open to
whatever happened in our brain.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Ten years later, I
still regard it as--

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.820 align:middle line:84%
in fact, even more so regarded
as the most significant

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.990 align:middle line:90%
experience I've ever had.

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:15.170 align:middle line:90%


00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:20.030 align:middle line:84%
At the time I did this,
I was in the more or less

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:23.900 align:middle line:84%
immediate aftermath of
a really tragic death.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.740 align:middle line:90%
My son died by suicide.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.430 align:middle line:84%
He went through
different forms of drugs

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:37.235 align:middle line:84%
from alcohol to ecstasy to
LSD to cocaine to heroin.

00:57:37.235 --> 00:57:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And one night I just
got a call that he

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.350 align:middle line:90%
had shot himself to death.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:00.060 align:middle line:84%
My son's death had left
me so raw and so in need

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:03.580 align:middle line:84%
of working through
certain things,

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:08.580 align:middle line:84%
so I regarded the whole
psilocybin experiment

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:13.375 align:middle line:84%
as at least potentially a way
to come to some further terms

00:58:13.375 --> 00:58:14.175 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:58:14.175 --> 00:58:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I went into it with a
good deal of skepticism.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in any certainly
not in any institutional way

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:32.545 align:middle line:84%
religious nor really a
believer in much of any sense.

00:58:32.545 --> 00:58:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:39.180 align:middle line:84%
As a philosopher, as a
professor of philosophy,

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I knew a lot about the
history of theology

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.090 align:middle line:84%
but didn't feel a great deal
of personal participation in.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the whole
thing quite prepared

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:51.630 align:middle line:84%
for a big zero on
the spiritual side.

00:58:51.630 --> 00:59:03.280 align:middle line:90%

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But I maintained a weird
clarity of mind at the same time

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
as though I was able to
observe from some position that

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.000 align:middle line:84%
was undisturbed while the
rest of my entire reality

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.790 align:middle line:90%
fell apart.

something like that

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:59.410 align:middle line:90%
is the very essence of life.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%

about trying to open oneself

until the day before

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%

So panpsychist comes from
the word pan, everywhere,

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and psyche, soul, and
it's an ancient faith.

01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:52.859 align:middle line:84%
So many philosophers in
the Western tradition

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:58.632 align:middle line:84%
have had it including Plato
and Spinoza and Schopenhauer.

01:09:58.632 --> 01:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But, of course,
it's very prevalent

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
if you look for it
in Buddhist faith

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:06.795 align:middle line:84%
that many more creatures may
be in soul than we think.

out very quickly after that.

01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:23.040 align:middle line:90%
But we really don't know.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
The bee has a brain that's
roughly a million neurons far

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.200 align:middle line:90%
smaller than us.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.905 align:middle line:84%
However, its complexity is
much denser, 10 times denser

01:10:33.905 --> 01:10:35.405 align:middle line:84%
than the neurons
in the human brain.

01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:47.600 align:middle line:90%


01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Many biologists, particularly
who think about consciousness,

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
believe it's an
emergent property.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The classical one
is wetness of water.

01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I can take a liquid
like water and it's wet.

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I can pour it over my clothes,
and I know what wet is.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Now if I ask is one
molecule of H2O isn't wet,

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have those properties
or two molecules of H2O,

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
so but at some point, if you
put enough molecules together,

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:11.463 align:middle line:90%
they have this property wetness.

01:11:11.463 --> 01:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
They cling to surfaces, and
they have tension, et cetera.

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.793 align:middle line:84%
So people think, well, you
have one or two neurons,

01:11:16.793 --> 01:11:17.960 align:middle line:90%
you don't get consciousness.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Forty-two you don't.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
billion, you get some,

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and if you have 2
billion, you get more.

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's just an
emergent property.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.450 align:middle line:90%
I used to think that.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But then consciousness is
just too radically different

01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
from anything else I know.

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Conscious experience,
subjectivity, feelings

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.780 align:middle line:84%
are too radically different
from anything else

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.360 align:middle line:84%

Max Planck, the father
of quantum physics,

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
said in the late '20s I regard
consciousness as fundamental.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I concur it's not something
first you're physics

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and then if you
have enough physics,

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
then somehow you
get consciousness.

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%

feature of the universe.

It's the openness
itself that is divine,

which then led me to
this massive realization

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that God is seeing
through our eyes,

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that God's on the adventure,
that God in a certain sense

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate
astronaut himself,

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%

these strange visions,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.180 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't get to see anything,

anything without us

experiences of life.

He doesn't go through life.

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words that we are the

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was to me
so new, a perspective

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%

truly grants freedom,

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't know the
outcome of those free acts.

He is on the adventure
more than anyone.

01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is truly open to whatever's
