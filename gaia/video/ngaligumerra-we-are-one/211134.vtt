presence and Dadirri,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
now is as simple as
allowing ourself to pause,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to connect with our
breath, to be seated,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:90%

out through our mouth.

And with each in-breath,
we breathe in with openness

so that we become
completely open.

our spirit that we imagine very
often on the spiritual path

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that because we're so
divided and disconnected,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
we have to put our attention
and focus first on spirit,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:84%
our soul, to awaken, to
remember our true self when it's

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
actually much harder to
awaken with a singular

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
focus in that way because
we're still disconnected

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
from the manifestation
of spirit,

here, birth, creation.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:84%
we cannot help but see
the interconnectedness

of everything.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And we celebrate it.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
We live it in sacred relating.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we're living
it in sacred relating,

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
we see and feel the
unique expression and soul

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
of every single living thing.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But we also recognize it is
the one same spirit and soul,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
kurrunpa.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
We can never fail when we
are connected in that way

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
because we never become trapped
in the ego identification which

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
causes the division,
and power over,

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that everything
revolves around me.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%

beautiful, deepest,

this interconnectedness

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
this human quest

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
to find that
reconnection and oneness.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:90%

is oneness, but you
are not number 1.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's also an
amazing tree to work

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:90%
with issues around sexuality.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So I've had people who
have come here for healing,

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and they might be dealing with
abuse or things from the past.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And I bring them here, and
the tree does the healing work

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It brings through their own
wisdom, their own healing.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a
release of emotions.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's also been great
when we've had partners

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
with intimacy
issues or whatever,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.088 align:middle line:84%
and we let the tree
help guide them.

00:13:35.088 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:90%
This one here is the first.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like the pioneer.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
in nature, you'll

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
often have one that will come
out first and test the waters.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it communicates
with the others and said,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
yeah, everything's right to
go, and then the rest of them

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%
will come and flower.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the sort
of wisdom you start

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
to get when you really
watch and notice

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:90%
the changes that are happening.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is one that
I often work with,

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:84%
with people who
often are pioneering,

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
the sort of path-cutters,
way-showers,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
within this that speaks to them.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And on Wanneroo
Country, the elders

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:84%
here taught me about their totem
tree or plant is the wattle,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and how there's a wattle
and a certain wattle that

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
will come and bloom at
the beginning of spring.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it has a DMT,
and it communicates

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of them.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's now time for
everyone to safely come out

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and blossom.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So imagine having that quality
within yourself, to really

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
sense that timing, to sense
when everything's ready for you

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.065 align:middle line:84%
to bring forth your
flowering, your shining.

00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You spoke about
the invisible.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And in lore, we speak of it
as being [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and that is the unseen.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
which is to be made seen.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
it doesn't exist

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
in the way our modern
mind interprets it,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
the invisible as if it
doesn't exist or it's without

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
substance.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you really feel into
that [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:84%
the unseen, in other words, it's
there but it hasn't been seen

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
yet, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
to be made seen.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so when we walk in Dadirri,
you begin the journey from

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] to
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And our awakening
is that journey.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:18.212 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first principle of
practice and state of being is

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Dadirri, which in general terms
would usually be translated

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:90%
as deep listening.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's oftentimes
used culturally

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how we can really
move towards reconciliation.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But Dadirri is much
deeper than this.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It is whole receptivity.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It is being so
deeply present where

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
we are, how we are, with
what we are in each moment,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that we are deeply listening,
deeply seeing, deeply

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:10.289 align:middle line:84%
feeling, deeply tasting, deeply
smelling, deeply sensing.

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
These spirits want all
that is good for you,

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
all that is right for you.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The water around, all the life
force that is in this water,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
contains healing energy, all
the elements for nurturing,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
for growth, for
restoration and renewal.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's like welcoming now,
welcoming all of the nurturing,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:90%
loving energies of life.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%

past, present, and emerging.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:90%
We acknowledge this.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We acknowledge Country.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:84%
We are here humbly as children
to welcome and to receive

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:90%
this healing now.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Here is the power of this
truth, that in every moment,

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:84%
as the breath rises and falls,
as thoughts come and go,

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
sensations flow, life in its
continuum, within all of this

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
is the unchanged,
unborn, undying.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:84%
This self, the one that is
listening, sensing, being,

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:84%
experiencing, this Dadirri, pure
awareness, this one remains,

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:84%
always has been, always
is, always will be.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
As this awareness,
deeply centered,

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
aligned, and open,
grounded, connected,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
breathing deeply,
breathing into your form,

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
feeling the radiance,
the vibration

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:84%
within you of this living
presence in continuum

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and that which is unchanged.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe deeply, feel
it flowing from cell to cell,

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
vibrating through your
aura, radiating in synergy

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:90%
with all existence.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Here, the one field of being
within and without, all united,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
always here, always being.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe with
this, acknowledge

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
this ever-constant presence,
the stillness and the vibrance,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the silence and
the song of life,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the unchanged and the
ever-transforming flowing

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
continuum, the revering of life.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
All is here, rising from
the unseen, to the seen,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:90%
and again back into the unseen.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:90%
All is here.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
As we breathe with this
now, we are this presence.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Breathing into the body,
feeling yourself here,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:90%
connected with ngura, Earth.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:90%
She is a part of you.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:84%
You are a part of her
and every living being.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe into
your form, into your body,

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
feel this presence
deep in your bones

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
flowing through your blood,
vibrating in rhythm with Earth

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.435 align:middle line:90%
and creation all around you.

00:22:21.435 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
into your heart center

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
now as you acknowledge the
sacred presence that is life

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
here within you and all around
you, the love, the grace,

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:84%
the power, the
peace, the oneness.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.475 align:middle line:90%
All is here.

00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So once we feel the connection
with the first three

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:90%
sacred pillars--

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
ngura, waltja,
kurrunpa-- we then

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
have a natural grasp of
tjukurpa, which is law.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And that, this lore, L-O-R-E,
which encompasses all

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmic laws of creation,
of dreaming, the dream time,

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
the song lines, essentially
the comprehension of everything

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that exists, how
and why it exists.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we then
have laws, L-A-W-S,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that enable us to maintain
and uphold with deep sacred

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:84%
responsibility our part within
the law of the cosmos so that

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
we maintain balance within
ourself and with each other.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And those laws govern
our society, our systems.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
For tens of thousands
of years, our people,

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
having lived deeply in
relationship with creation,

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
have seen and known that
everything of creation

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:84%
is emerging through
the vibration of sound.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything is sung into being.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Before a child is
even conceived,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:84%
let alone born, the
child is already

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
being sung in by the people
who are already existing,

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:84%
by the ancestors,
by the Country,

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.570 align:middle line:90%
the creatures of the place.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
When that soul is conceived,
there is a singing vibration.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:84%
When that soul is in utero,
there's a singing vibration.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
When the child is born,
the child is sung in.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And so all things are
created in this way.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not a linear trajectory.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes think
of a song line

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
as having a beginning, and
an end, and a specific track.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's multidimensional.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
complex than that.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Which is why sometimes
it's called song spirals,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%

ancient past within the present

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and the future integrating
in the present,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:90%
adapting and evolving.

In our culture as Aunty
B. mentioned before,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have iPads, and we
didn't write and communicate

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.470 align:middle line:90%
in that manner.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We communicated by way of whole
brain learning, whole brain

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:90%
And so it was oral.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
It was through
song, dance, but it

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:84%
was also through
direct association

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:90%
with all of our surrounds.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are particular
places or parts of nature

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that become memory
banks for our people.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
ways our people were

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:84%
able to store information,
thousands of names of species,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
thousands of places,
knowing tracks, where to go,

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
when to go, how to go,
without our modern devices.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So the scribbly gum is an
example of this capacity for us

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So we might allocate
this scribble

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
as a particular part
of a dreaming story.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And by associating the
shape of the scribble--

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:84%
it could also be in a rock,
markings, lines in a rock--

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we give them a
specific association

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to perhaps a creature,
or a place, or a species,

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
or as I said in this example, a
particular part of a song line

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:90%
or a dream story.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:90%

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.625 align:middle line:84%

researched and proven.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%

on through each generation,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%

contained within the songs

our whole way through
Country, knowing

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
