there called the Dreamers.

They lived away
from the main clan.

But when you came across
one of these Dreamers,

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
they would ask you
what your dream was,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
literally, physically,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:90%

Leave it on.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.971 align:middle line:90%
I want you to film it.

00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I've raised money, stayed
up for weeks at a time,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:84%
divorced my husband, neglected
my health and those close

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But I did it because
I was after something.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:53.354 align:middle line:84%
I never cried, never
complained, because I'm a doer.

00:26:53.354 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And the one
thing I've always wanted

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:07.687 align:middle line:84%
is the one thing I need to
save my goddaughter's life.

00:27:07.687 --> 00:27:09.683 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have it.

00:27:09.683 --> 00:27:22.791 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
ENO (VOICEOVER): In a
way, you are collecting

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:84%
all images, all
emotions, the way it is

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and the way you'd like it to be.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you choose,
use the Gift to focus

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:90%
upon what you truly desire.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Just follow your intuition.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.371 align:middle line:84%
You'll be fine.
-OK.

00:27:37.371 --> 00:27:41.404 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.404 --> 00:27:43.348 align:middle line:90%
They're spying on us.

00:27:43.348 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
There's something I
should have told you.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I am connected to this human.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It was my parent figure that
brought the Gift to Earth.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:90%
EELA: Yes, I know.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
ENO: There's something else my
family's chosen not to share.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.898 align:middle line:84%
There was an encounter, the
nature of which was unexpected.

00:28:09.898 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.066 align:middle line:84%
Bonnie and I are of
the same lineage.

00:28:15.066 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
try something now.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
For the next couple minutes,
I want you to talk only

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
about what you want
to see in your life,

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
as if you could wave a magic
wand and create anything.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I see my entire
staff reinstated,

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and they all have their own
personalized parking spots.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I see vibrant red
balls that symbolize

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:90%
our passionate hearts.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I see a picture in my mind
of myself at my very best.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:84%
A fearless heart that resonates
with an endless passion

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.390 align:middle line:10%
And with a little
coaching from my director,

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:10%
I realize this is who I am.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So I hold this self-portrait
of positivity in my heart.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I, um, honor myself for
my beauty and my strength.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
The moment I said that, I
felt a rush of possibilities,

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
as if there was an
unlimited potential.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was here, right
here, the whole time.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.013 align:middle line:84%
Eno, there's a
message from Ballion.

00:29:39.013 --> 00:29:44.981 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's all right.
It's just a painting.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I was in your quarters
monitoring your progress.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I was there longer
than expected and--

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Security Console found me.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Your actions are
no longer a secret.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
If you do not
return immediately--

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:84%
You will be extracted with
or without your consent.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Ballion, why were you in
Eno's quarters for so long?

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I watched--

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Two of your Earth cinemas.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Which ones?

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.051 align:middle line:84%
A cinematic set
simply entitled--

00:30:09.051 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:84%
-"Rocky."
-Yes.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The one least
likely to succeed--

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Rose up and became champion--

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Of the world.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It was his inner strength that
propelled him like a rocket.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:90%
He kind of reminds me of you.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Interesting that you say that.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Because when they spoke
of Eye of the Tiger--

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.746 align:middle line:90%
I felt it inside.

00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:84%
-[LAUGHS] Yes, I'm sure you did.
-Are you--

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Laughing?

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you're very funny
when you're inspired.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Eye of the Tiger.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:90%
And funny.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.178 align:middle line:90%
It is a new day.

00:30:39.178 --> 00:30:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe you were
caught in a solar storm.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:90%
It can't be helped.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Or circumnavigated.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.750 align:middle line:90%
The heat is simply too great.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.425 align:middle line:84%
But I will report your
return is imminent.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.122 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure you don't
want the big room?

00:31:05.122 --> 00:31:06.616 align:middle line:90%
No, this is lovely.

00:31:06.616 --> 00:31:08.608 align:middle line:90%
I like this one.

00:31:08.608 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I want you to stay
as long as you like.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Marcia.

Hey, Hailee.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Um, OK.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.756 align:middle line:84%
Since you're a scientist, I'm
going to give you a formula

00:31:29.756 --> 00:31:30.755 align:middle line:90%
that you can follow every day.

00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The first ingredient--
you must create

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:90%
a state of deep relaxation.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.524 align:middle line:84%
The fastest way to do
this is with laughter.

My apologies about the
display stand the other night.

00:31:41.428 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no problem, man.

Second ingredient is
to create heart-opening.

00:32:06.635 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The third ingredient--
you must see

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
your cinematic
image in your mind

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and then allow your
heart to follow.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I see a picture in my
mind of the very best

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:90%
of myself. [LAUGHS]

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You have such dignity
and a quiet strength.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I wish more women could
see that in themselves.

heart that resonates

for her research.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It was years ago.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, I hope you're
not expecting some

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:90%
mushy, tearful outpouring here.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.071 align:middle line:84%
That's-- that's
just not my nature.

No expectations.

I just wanted to say thank you.

You first met my son,
Gabe, when he was 10.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.950 align:middle line:84%
After hearing about your
work, he immediately

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:90%
wanted a toy microscope.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Gabe has graduated from Harvard.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:84%

BONNIE (VOICEOVER): Bye, guys.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.237 align:middle line:90%
I'll miss you.

ENO (VOICEOVER): We
will miss you, as well.

00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:18.398 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:36:39.726 --> 00:36:42.702 align:middle line:84%
We are astounded
at their heart.

00:36:42.702 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:84%
No matter the pain or
setback, their ability

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.640 align:middle line:84%
to create an evolution
from within surpasses

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:84%
any ability we've
ever encountered.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:84%
It's as if their depth
of emotion from adversity

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
helps them to feel
deeper, to laugh harder,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to live at the highest
possible vibration.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
We will miss them, but we
will carry them in our hearts.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.274 align:middle line:84%
Eno, is there anything
you wish to add?

00:37:07.274 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship
