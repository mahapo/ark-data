in the sexual revolution.

they're sexually active because
they can control whether they

You couldn't just go to your
doctor and get a diaphragm.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:90%
You have to be married.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%

just take the pill until you get

you have the placebo.

00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can take them if

And that's just when
you're menstruating.

organization because really we

thought the menstrual cycle
was a vital sign because of how

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:10%
much it can tell you
about your body's health.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have conversations
like this when I was growing up.

>> We have this
beautiful, intrinsic,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
innate blueprint that
is synced to nature.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It's synced to
circadian rhythms.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
It starts in our brain,
in our hypothalamus,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:84%
runs through our pituitary,
goes through our ovaries.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's cyclic.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not a steady state.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, when our hormones
are in their natural flow,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
those hormones change
our emotional milieu.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:90%
They change how we feel.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:10%
They change our
experience of the world.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:10%
>> In a normal menstrual
cycle, there are brain hormones

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:10%
communicating to the ovaries.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's how we orchestrate
ovulation and this really

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:10%
symphony of your
menstrual cycle.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:10%
But on hormonal
birth control, you

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:10%
put the entire system on mute.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.855 align:middle line:10%
You're blocking
the text messages.

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:10%
So there's some
dude texting you.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.272 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to hear
from him and you block it.

00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So your ovaries
just get shut down.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>> You're switching off your
own ovaries and you're replacing

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:10%
them with these two chemicals.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What do these hormonal
contraceptives contain?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
They contain synthetic estrogen
and/or synthetic progestin.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
It works by
suppressing ovulation.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:90%
That way an egg isn't released.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Although a lot of women
are told that it's regulating

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:10%
your cycle or it's like your
body thinks it's pregnant,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.745 align:middle line:10%
none of those things are
actually what's going on.

00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting
a period when you're

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:90%
taking hormonal birth control.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a withdrawal bleed.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Typically in that pill
pack, it will have three weeks

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:10%
of synthetic hormones and then
one week or so of bleeding.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:10%
And people call that
time a withdrawal bleed.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't consider
it to be like a period

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
because when you stop taking
the synthetic hormone,

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
it acts like that
drop in hormones

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that you see with
the menstruation.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:10%
>> This idea that we've
been sold by pharmaceutical

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:10%
companies that you should
just take the pill and get rid

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:10%
of your hormones is really
incomplete and potentially

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:10%
dangerous.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you know?

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you know?

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you know that when
you're on a birth control pill,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.917 align:middle line:10%
there is no medical need
to have a monthly period?

00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:10%
Like other birth control pills--

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:10%
>> They're marketed as something
called lifestyle drugs,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:10%
a really powerful hormonal
synthetic cocktail.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:10%
It sounds really nice and fun,
like it's going to fix my acne

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:10%
or it's going to fix
my period or it's

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:10%
going to regulate my cycle.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And what we didn't realize
is that we were turning off

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
this really important part
of our bodily function that

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
was happening every
month, which is ovulation.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The prevailing narrative is
that we don't need to ovulate

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:10%
unless we want to make
a baby, which is crazy

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:10%
because ovulation,
regular ovulation,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:10%
which means having a regular,
natural menstrual cycle,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:10%
is how we make our hormones
estrogen and progesterone,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:10%
which have many benefits.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
To say that we don't
need to ovulate except

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
to make a baby would
be like saying to men,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.573 align:middle line:84%
until you're ready
for a baby, we're

00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
just going to give you this drug
to shut down your testosterone.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do to women.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.783 align:middle line:84%
>> These hormones affect
our bone development.

00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:90%
They affect our brain.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.158 align:middle line:84%
They affect our
breast development.

00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
They affect our risk of
cardiovascular issues

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:90%
later on in life.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And it makes just no sense to
think that you could shut down

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
ovulation in healthy women and
it would make no difference.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:10%
>> We are putting younger and
younger women on birth control.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And there haven't
been studies done

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:10%
on the safety of that long term
in terms of their mental health

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:10%
and their reproductive health.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm on the pill.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't actually think
which one it is right now.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's like the one when
you take it for three weeks

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:90%
and have a week off.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I've been
on it for six months.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely feel a
bit more crazy, not crazy,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.603 align:middle line:90%
but more hormonal.

00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm currently
taking Yasmin.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.512 align:middle line:84%
I've been taking that probably
for around seven, eight years.

00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:39.095 align:middle line:84%
Before that, I was
on a different pill

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:40.908 align:middle line:84%
called Dianette, which
actually I didn't

00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:90%
have a very good experience on.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It made me massive mood
swings, feel very depressed.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I was moody.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I got fat.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%
I was sad.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I was bitchy and just
not a very nice person.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I just,
it just wasn't--

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, it wasn't great.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks so much for agreeing
to share your story with The

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Debrief.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a bit about what's been
going on with you and the pill.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, so much.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, when I was 17,
I went on the pill.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It really all began for me
when I was about 14 or 15 and I

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
was first prescribed hormonal
contraception to regulate

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:90%
really heavy periods.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't like how
I felt. And I couldn't

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%
articulate that feeling.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
But I knew something was wrong.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I stopped taking the pill
after about six months.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't start
taking it again

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
until I entered into a
serious long-term relationship

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:90%
and wanted contraception.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:10%
That was when my life just
completely fell apart.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I started having
debilitating panic attacks,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I
couldn't go to work.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't leave the house.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was prescribed medication
for depression and anxiety

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And then one night I
remember sitting in my flat.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I was having an anxiety attack
that had lasted for hours I

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
really, really, honestly,
was contemplating

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
ending my life because I
was sitting there thinking,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
if this is what my life
is going to be like,

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to live it.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
This is no way to live.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
across this forum.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading post
after post after post

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
where women were describing
pretty much exactly what I

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:84%
felt. And it was one of those
moments where you're like,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:90%
this is almost too good.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Could it be my pill?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:90%
No, surely not.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I decided without
discussing it with my doctor

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to come off the pill.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Within three months, I was fine.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel like every
emotion I feel is my own.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:10%
And that really formed the heart
of the Debrief investigation,

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:10%
"Mad About the Pill."

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
We then run a
survey on the site.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And we thought we'd get
a few responses on this.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We were overwhelmed
by the number

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:90%
of Debrief readers, thousands.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Without the pill, I felt like
I gained back some clarity

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and was able to
shift my thoughts

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
towards positive development
rather than flailing around

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:90%
in my own misery.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so many people
saying the same thing,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:90%
like my GP didn't know.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:90%
My GP couldn't help me.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
My GP didn't make
these connections.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> For this many people to
want to talk about something,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
it means they don't feel like
they have anywhere else to go.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.448 align:middle line:84%
>> And it can feel
quite isolating.

00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It's such a personal
thing, isn't it?

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to be able to
get that information from

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:90%
a reliable source.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't until a study from
the University of Copenhagen

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
came out, authored by
Professor Lidegaard,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
finding a correlation between
women suffering from depression

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety and women taking
hormonal contraception.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:10%
>> People don't like the message
that hormonal contraception may

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:10%
bring depression.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:10%
A woman should know it
could be a consequence

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:10%
of her hormonal
contraceptive use

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.175 align:middle line:10%
because then she
can stop that use.

00:13:19.175 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:10%
A majority of women
do not get depressed.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:10%
But the denial of the
existence of that problem

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:10%
implies that women are
not asked sufficiently.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>> When I went through
my training, I was told,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:10%
there's not a mood effect.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:10%
But I can tell you from being on
the pill myself, I can tell you

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:10%
from taking care
of 25,000 women,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:10%
there is definitely
a mood effect.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's well demonstrated
in the literature.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Based off the
conclusions of this study,

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:10%
we should actually be warning
women about the fact that they

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:10%
could get depressed on the pill.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:10%
Many, many women came forward
to say, this vindicates me.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:10%
This makes me feel
like I'm not crazy.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not all in my head.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Once I started making those
connections for myself,

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I was researching into
how this happened.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know, the pill
could do all these things to me.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Exactly how did it do them?

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And welcome back.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk
with research professor

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:10%
and psychologist Sarah Hill.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:10%
>> She's the author
of the new book.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.603 align:middle line:10%
It's called "This is Your
Brain on Birth Control--

00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:10%
The Surprising Science
of Women, Hormones,

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.615 align:middle line:10%
and the Law of
Unintended Consequences."

00:14:39.615 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>> When they're
talking about the pill,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:10%
women always talk about
how it makes them feel.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think that until
now, women haven't really

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:10%
had an explanation for why
they're feeling that way.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to look at what role
women's sex hormones play

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:10%
in orchestrating the
activities of women's brains.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.245 align:middle line:10%
And then how does all of
that change on the pill?

00:15:01.245 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Taking the pill is associated
with having a dampened stress

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
response, particularly the
stress hormone cortisol.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It actually just makes women
less able to cope with stress.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And it can also cause
problems with things

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:90%
like learning and memory.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So it can cause mood-related
symptomology that we oftentimes

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
see in pill-taking women,
things like depression,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:90%
things like anxiety.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And it can be associated with
even feelings of brain fog.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you're a different
version of yourself

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
when you're on
hormonal contraception

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
relative to the
version of yourself

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
that you are when
you're off of it.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Women shouldn't have to
change who they are in order

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.435 align:middle line:84%
to protect themselves
from pregnancy.

00:15:43.435 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And we should know
enough about the way

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.518 align:middle line:84%
that our brains
and our bodies work

00:15:46.518 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
to know that that's exactly
what we're doing when we

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.958 align:middle line:90%
go on the birth control pill.

00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:90%

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:10%
When you look at
hormonal birth control,

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:10%
there's a long laundry
list of side effects,

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:10%
from anxiety and increased
risk of depression,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:10%
painful sex, low libido,
to nutrient depletion,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:10%
migraine headaches,
weight gain, insomnia,

it has on partner attraction.

>> The body of knowledge
that was growing, I think,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:10%
through anecdotal reports
was that women would go off

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:10%
the pill and realize that they
weren't happy with the person

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:10%
that they had chosen as a mate.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a sweaty T-shirt study
that you can choose a good mate

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:90%
based on smell.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you're on the pill,
that sort of mechanism

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.385 align:middle line:90%
seems to be offline.

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We're seeking out the mate
that will offer us the most

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.205 align:middle line:90%
genetic diversity.

00:16:55.205 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're a woman
and you've ever

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
smelt your partner after
they're working out the gym

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, mm, that
smells so good, when they're

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
a little bit stinky, they're
expressing their MHC complex.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving your
brain and your entire body

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:84%
data about their immune
system and about their genetic

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:90%
compatibility with you.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> On hormonal contraceptives,
you end up choosing somebody

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.925 align:middle line:84%
who is more alike
than different.

00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The catchphrase became
that you end up mating

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
with somebody who is more like
brother and less like other.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> There's millions of
women on this medication.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
That literally changes
their emotions.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
It changes their pheromones.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It changes their sex drive.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
What is the possible
impact on the world?

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>> You're watching
"The Breakfast Club."

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Morning, everybody.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.847 align:middle line:10%
We've got some special
guests in the building.

00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:55.272 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Amun, Dr. Amsu, and Coach
Gessie, thank you very much--

00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I had Gessie's name right.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --for joining us.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It is National Sexual
Health Awareness Month.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I see you guys have these
Kill the Pill shirts on.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:90%
It.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:90%
What is the pill?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of pill are
y'all trying to kill?

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What kinds pill we killing?

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, we
champion women's causes.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:90%
We've championed fibroids.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
We've championed PCOS, which
is polycystic ovarian syndrome.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.790 align:middle line:84%
We've championed
endometriosis and infertility.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
The number one culprit of
actually all of these issues,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
the elephant in the room
is the birth control pill.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> People are being told
that the pill is the greatest

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:90%
invention of all time.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:10%
But it's making our women sick.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:10%
That's why we're saying kill
the pill before it kills you.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I am one of the 90% of
Black women affected by uterine

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.945 align:middle line:90%
fibroids by age 50.

00:18:45.945 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:10%
My grueling journey
included 12 surgeries,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:10%
five of them for fibroids
and five for complications

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:10%
from those fibroids,
and even my heart

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:10%
stopping on the delivery table.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.700 align:middle line:10%
But thank God when I birthed
my miracle baby, Nia,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:10%
she birthed me into
my purpose and work

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:10%
as a fibroids activist.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:10%
>> So many women we talk with
on a daily basis will say, oh,

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:10%
wait a minute, yeah, I just have
a heavy cycle or I just have

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:10%
a heavy period, and not
realizing that they are

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:10%
actually exhibiting symptoms
of what is the root cause

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:10%
of fibroids, which is
the estrogen dominance.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:10%
It's triggered by stress,
diet, and pollutants.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, those chemical pollutants,
the number one culprit

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
was birth control,
hormonal birth controls.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:90%
OMG.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
11.5 million-- I don't know if
you know this number, Angela,

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
but 11.5 million of us women and
girls are actually on the pill.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But 35% of the women
who are prescribed it

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
are prescribed it for
noncontraceptive PMS reasons.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
They're being told,
you need this.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
you're going to be

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:90%
able to actually restore your--

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.405 align:middle line:90%
have a normal life.

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Over time, what happens with it
is that it masks your symptoms.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then once you get off
the birth control, what

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
happens, we find
out, holy cow, there

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
have been monsters
developing in the background.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Bringing the estrogen--
I'm talking to these women

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
daily about birth
control causing fibroids,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
causing infertility,
causing pulmonary embolism,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
blood clots, where women
have lost their lives.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look
at when something

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
is so prevalent
and so inextricably

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:44.332 align:middle line:84%
tied into women's lives,
why are we sicker as women?

00:20:44.332 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you go on the birth
control pill for something

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
other than
controlling pregnancy?

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Regulate my period, too.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I was having a lot of
issues with getting it,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:90%
not getting it.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was in high school,
it was recommended for my skin.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember why you
went on the birth control pill

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> For PCOS,
polycystic syndrome.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Too often I see women put
on birth control pills not

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
for contraception but to deal
with breakthrough bleeding

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
or so forth, where the doctor
never bothers to test them

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:84%
first and see why
it's happening.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
There's just this knee-jerk,
shoot-from-the-hip, boom,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:90%
take the birth control pill.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Birth control is
incredibly useful.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that
it's so useful,

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:10%
it's being used as a
treatment for a hell

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:10%
of a lot of things that aren't
keep that baby out of me.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>> So many women go on the
pill for something like

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:10%
endometriosis, for instance,
because that is the only

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:10%
solution that's really
offered now by doctors.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, I
mean, it's just a Band-Aid.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:10%
>> It suppresses their
pain a little bit.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:10%
But, I mean, unfortunately,
I do find when a lot of them

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:10%
get off of it, the
pain is right back.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:10%
>> 1 in 10 women suffer
from endometriosis.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's just one of the many
painful, debilitating lady

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:10%
diseases that gets treated
with birth control and a shrug.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
There's also
dysmenorrhea, irregular

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
or excessive bleeding, and
polycystic ovary syndrome.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
PCOS afflicts 1 in 10
women with symptoms

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:84%
like weight gain, hair
growth, fertility problems,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:90%
and diabetes.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> After three years,
this fertility specialist

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
on the Upper West
Side goes, yeah,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.603 align:middle line:84%
you have cysts all
over your ovaries.

00:22:23.603 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
does that mean?

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.395 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
it's the leading

00:22:26.395 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
cause of infertility, diabetes,
and heart disease in women.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And here are more
birth control pills.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like finding all of your
furniture on your front lawn

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and the police are
like, that's life.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Want to take the pill?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In the doctor's mind, you're
having a withdrawal bleed every

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:90%
month, which they call a period.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, you're fixed.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But nobody talks to that
woman about the fact

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that she's at higher
risk for diabetes.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:84%
She's at higher risk for
stroke and heart attack.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:10%
>> We're not setting women free.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:10%
We're setting them
up for disease.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.865 align:middle line:84%
We're setting them up
for a lot of problems.

00:22:56.865 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Erika, known to
you all better as Farmer Girl.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:10%
Although I'm from a
small town in Colorado,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:10%
I have had the
opportunity to travel

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:10%
to many parts of the
world and the US.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
In a way, I define myself,
that experience I've had,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.955 align:middle line:90%
by traveling.

00:23:17.955 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> We're at her home in Arizona.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And my cell phone rang.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was Erika's phone.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:10%
And I answered in anticipation
of our upcoming visit

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:10%
from her for Thanksgiving.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't her.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:90%
It was her boyfriend.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said, there's a problem.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And he had come
into the apartment

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:90%
and found her on the floor.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And she was taken by ambulance.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And we later learned
that had multiple heart

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%

the emergency room.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I was able to talk to the
emergency room doctor.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And he asked if she
was on birth control.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, the NuvaRing.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, I believe
that's the problem.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have pulmonary
embolisms going on here.

she was brain dead.

they pronounced her dead.

us down the hallway and put

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Erika's lungs up on
the screen and said,

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
this was caused by the NuvaRing.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
She actually was prescribed
the NuvaRing because

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:90%
of having an ovarian cyst.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that
most ovarian cysts

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.255 align:middle line:90%
resolve themselves anyway.

00:24:57.255 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Our daughter was really strong.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.288 align:middle line:84%
And if she knew
what we now know,

00:25:09.288 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:84%
she would be right
here doing this

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
because she would be
incensed at what's

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.870 align:middle line:84%
going on at the expense of
women's health unnecessarily.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.440 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Every day that goes
by, we know there's

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.990 align:middle line:84%
girls out there that are
not informed and, therefore,

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:90%
at risk.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:34.085 align:middle line:84%

we can to help inform.

these magazines,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I would buy all of them.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the checker
would ask me, are you in it?

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Why are you buying it?

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I just tell them,
my daughter died

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:90%
because of this birth control.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I show them the article.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the very first day
that I bought it, one checker

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
said that she just started
taking it about a month ago

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and she said she has some pain
right at the top of her thigh.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So I told her she needs
to go in right now.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I handed her to the magazine
right then and there.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Brittany kept it
in the original bag

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that she got from
Planned Parenthood.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And she hid it underneath the
cheese in the refrigerator

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:90%
so her dad wouldn't see it.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's been in
there ever since.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:84%
They look like a
condom with the foil.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But down on the bottom it says,
"doesn't protect against HIV."

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about a black
warning label that says,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:90%
"could cause death"?

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:90%

>> We just kind of got
ready in her bedroom.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:90%
And we went out to a club.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:10%
I remember when we first walked
in she said how loud it was.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:10%
She said it was so loud.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> We all love to dance.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I don't
feel like dancing.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought it was really
weird because we've always

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:90%
gone out to dance.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And then she felt like
her heart was racing.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I was like, maybe she's
having an anxiety attack.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
she's sitting there

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and her eyes kind of roll back.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And she just, like
she kind of hits us.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I remember calling 911.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Right when we got to the
hospital, I called my mom.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just said,
what happened?

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, "Mom,
just come out."

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%

from the head nurse.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:10%

came in without a heartbeat

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:10%

bleeding from the lungs.

come in and see her.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
But there were so many people--

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> --trying to save her.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said her lungs
were hemorrhaging.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't get it to stop.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what was the matter.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she was drugged
or she had a disease.

no medications.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And my mom's like, well,
yeah, she's on medication.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.828 align:middle line:90%
She's on birth control.

00:28:22.828 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, I didn't
even think about that.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So we prayed.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:90%
We hoped for miracles.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
But they did another brain scan.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor came and told
us that Brittany was gone.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we had to tell the
family that Brittany

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
was no longer going to be
with us, that we had lost her.

I'm told that I should
file a report with the FDA.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:90%

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
having population issues and
they're living in poverty.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>> You have a population
where doctors say, hey,

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:10%
these women have been clamoring
for the ability to be able

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.530 align:middle line:10%
to control their fertility.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't know about
the possibilities of the side

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Five women died on the trial.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the five
deaths was a suicide.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:10%
And, of course,
they said that had

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.940 align:middle line:10%
nothing to do with the pill.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So when the drug companies
presented the findings

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to the FDA, they
omitted things that

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.830 align:middle line:90%
weren't comfortable to them.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.080 align:middle line:84%
They included things
that were comfortable.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it came
out after the fact.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Women were taking this
pill in more and more numbers.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
the first decade,

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:90%
the uptake was incredible.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But women had really
severe side effects.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Enovid, the first pill,
had a very high level

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:84%
of synthetic estrogen.
And it caused women

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:59.310 align:middle line:10%
to have a lot of really
serious physical side effects

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:10%
as well as things
like depression.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It wasn't very long when
the first blood clot came out,

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:10%
'63, the first case
report of a heart attack.

>> Most of the things that are
done to us are done without

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:10%
our real informed consent.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that our rights
are violated all the time

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:90%
by most doctors.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Barbara Seaman
wrote this book,

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:10%
"The Doctor's Case
Against the Pill."

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:28.590 align:middle line:10%
She wanted to interview medical
professionals about the pill

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:10%
and see it from
their perspective.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:84%
What were the
dangers of the pill?

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
More and more women were
taking this medication.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And those numbers were
growing so rapidly.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:84%
What could that
mean going forward?

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:90%
[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And that book was
really a catalyst

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
for what we now see as the
Women's Health Movement.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I moved to DC in '69.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:84%
It was just a hotbed of
stuff happening there.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.490 align:middle line:84%
We had a collective of women
called DC Women's Liberation.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:90%
We had an office.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:90%
We would meet every day.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.390 align:middle line:84%
We all had side
effects on the pill.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I, for instance,
had had hair loss.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my doctor at the
time, who was a man, of course,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.953 align:middle line:90%
I said, could this be--

00:35:29.953 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
could this be
related to the pill?

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:84%
One day, eight of us
were sitting around

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
at one of our endless
meetings, saying

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow there's
supposedly hearings

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:90%
on the Hill about the pill.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.590 align:middle line:90%
We said, well, let's go.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:84%
In those days, you could
get into Senate hearings.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Gaylord Nelson was a Senator
in Wisconsin and had been given

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:84%
a copy of Barbara Seaman's book,
which spurred him to sponsor

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:90%
the Nelson Pill Hearings.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Seaman called
it the Boston Tea Party

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:90%

are consuming oral contraceptive

medications in the belief
that they are considered safe

by the American Food
and Drug Administration.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We have young women having
strokes from abnormal clots

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.940 align:middle line:90%
in arteries.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We were sitting
in the audience.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing all
these men are testifying.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.167 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about people dying.

00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:90%
First we raised our hands.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And nobody called on us.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.413 align:middle line:84%
Then we just stood up
and started yelling.

00:36:34.413 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> How long am I going to
have to sit here listening

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to the terrible effects of these
pills on women without hearing

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.938 align:middle line:90%
from a single woman?

00:36:40.938 --> 00:36:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to know where the
drug companies' research

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:90%
studies are.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Why do they all know that they
have many adverse side effects

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:84%
that it's taken 10 years for
you to begin to bring out?

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You say no significant
effects on lactation.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean to the
mother of the child?

00:36:54.170 --> 00:37:00.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now if you would
be quiet a moment, I'm--

00:37:00.538 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>> We've been quite for--

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been quiet
for a long time.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Quiet?

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.940 align:middle line:84%
We are not going to
sit quietly any longer.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
You are murdering us for
your profit and convenience.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The committee will decide
who the witnesses will be.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And we are trying to take the
best scientific testimony we

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
can get of those
who know the most

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.130 align:middle line:90%
about the effects of the pill.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Ask women.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Ask women.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:90%
I know that I was not warned.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.512 align:middle line:84%
I know that I was told
that they were safe.

00:37:25.512 --> 00:37:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, now I'm going
to proceed with the hearings.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be dis--

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll also proceed
with our questioning then.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Officer, we will-- we will--

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to take women,
you're going to drag women out

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of this hearing whose
lives are at stake.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a fine way
to run something.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It got an enormous
amount of publicity.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This hearing is supposed
to be about informed consent,

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:84%
as I was just told, which
is an amazing thing to me

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:84%
because none of us,
not only did we not--

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:84%
were we not told of the
dangers of the pill.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
When we came in
with problems, when

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
we came in with side
effects, we were

00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:90%
told to go on using the pill.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the
transcripts of the hearing?

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:06.763 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Through Bernie
Sanders' office,

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the transcripts were photocopied
and were released through

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:90%
the Freedom of Information Act.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.850 align:middle line:10%
>> They knew much of what we
should know and should have

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.610 align:middle line:10%
paid attention to prior to
it coming to the market.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:23.615 align:middle line:10%
They knew it already.

00:38:23.615 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you consider the
hazards potential or real?

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, some of the
hazards are real.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:10%
>> They knew about the
effects on metabolism.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:10%
They knew about effects on mood.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:10%
They had evidence of
some suicides and deaths

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:10%
in the research, in
the original trials.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of evidence back
then of all these effects.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And our position is that
the oral contraceptives are

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.360 align:middle line:84%
an effective and safe
method of birth control.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It was the American Medical
Association with the drug

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.660 align:middle line:10%
manufacturers that decided
what the risk was and what it

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:10%
wasn't.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.620 align:middle line:10%
It was really kind of
a turning point in such

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:10%
that they allowed the industry
to dictate the safety, what

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.970 align:middle line:10%
was safe and what was not.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I expected to see
all the medical stuff.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.620 align:middle line:84%
But when I got to
the parts where

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.160 align:middle line:84%
doctors are talking
about basically changing

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:84%
the benefit-to-risk paradigm to
get it approved because it was

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:84%
the benefit to society versus
the risk to the individual,

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.500 align:middle line:90%
that blew me away.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Every pharmaceutical
company does that.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You hear that all the
time, benefit versus risk.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And nobody ever says benefit
to who versus my risk?

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A delegation from the Women's
Liberation Movement visited

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Senator Gaylord Nelson.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They complained that Nelson's
investigation of birth control

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:84%
pill safety did not call women
who take the pill or women

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:49.580 align:middle line:90%
doctors and researchers.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened as a result of
our persistence was the first

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
patient package insert of
a prescription medication.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.650 align:middle line:84%
What we had envisioned in
the beginning with something

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that would be on the
back of the pill packet

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and give six warning signs,
not such a long, lengthy thing.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't win.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> The lawyers got a hold of it.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> A good way to put it.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The lawyers got a
hold of it, yes.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Ultimately, there was a
win for the feminist health

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
movement in that
we got labeling.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was copied
throughout the industry.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really
have drug labels

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.250 align:middle line:84%
with all that fine print telling
us what the possible side

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:90%
effects might be.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.840 align:middle line:10%
But the label that
they went with really

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:10%
focused on blood clots and
left everything else off

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:39.610 align:middle line:10%
of that fine print.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> At this clinic in Washington
and clinics like it all over

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the country, millions of
women started taking the pill

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and they had unprecedented
freedom from unwanted

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:90%
pregnancies.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.740 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the symbolic
representation of state

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:10%
government intervention, not
just have you had your pill,

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:10%
but everything that the
birth control pill conotates

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.640 align:middle line:10%
and represents for
an urban population.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.370 align:middle line:84%
The relationship between
medicine, particularly

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.740 align:middle line:84%
reproductive medicine,
and women's bodies

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is a long and complicated,
oftentimes troubling history.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Historically, Black
enslaved women were used

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.980 align:middle line:10%
for experimentation to move
ahead modern gynecology that we

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:10%
see today.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:10%
>> They had these slave
hospitals where they would

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.500 align:middle line:10%
treat the pathologies of
Black women so they could save

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:10%
the lives of white women.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And so by the time you move
from the late 19th century

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to the mid 20th century, you
have doctors who are getting

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:84%
the OK from the government to be
able to perform surgeries that

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.240 align:middle line:84%
essentially sterilize
Black women.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:84%
In the South, Civil Rights
leader Fannie Lou Hamer

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:84%
talked about being a
young woman in the 1950s

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.092 align:middle line:90%
and going in for a procedure.

00:42:24.092 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And, all of a
sudden, she finds out

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:84%
she has a Mississippi
appendectomy.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.340 align:middle line:84%
She was essentially
sterilized by the doctor,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.130 align:middle line:90%
who had never told her.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>> She was told she was having
the tubes tied and that she

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.410 align:middle line:84%
could have undone
whatever she wanted.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:90%
She asked to have the undone.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:10%
And now they told her that
her tube, it was not tied.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.970 align:middle line:10%
It was clipped, which gives
her a lesser possibility of her

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:47.930 align:middle line:10%
ever becoming pregnant.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's wrong for anyone
to go into these things without

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:84%
fully knowing what
the possibilities.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think that people try to
make you pay for being poor

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and make you pay for
being glad and then--

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And being a woman.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> As women of color, our
fertility has always been

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.410 align:middle line:90%
managed.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It's always been fear based.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:84%
We had Indigenous women
that were also sterilized.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.530 align:middle line:84%
In the '60s in
Los Angeles, there

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.290 align:middle line:84%
were immigrant Mexican
women that were also

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:90%
sterilized at the USC center.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So we see these different
cases being repeated.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> By the '80s and the '90s,
all of a sudden in places like

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Harlem, in places like Detroit,
you start to see that Black

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:84%
women who receive aid from
the government being told,

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:84%
you can't live in
government housing anymore.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We are not going to give
you food stamps for you

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and your children
unless you agree

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to get on a LARC,
long-acting contraceptive.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
you have these women

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:90%
who have Norplant implanted.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're suffering
the consequences

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:90%
of these side effects.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know how
to take the implants out.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Here you have women who are,
essentially, once again,

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.230 align:middle line:90%
being used as guinea pigs.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And so although
they've been informed,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.060 align:middle line:84%
what's the actual
choice when someone's

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:84%
telling you that your
economic livelihood is

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.260 align:middle line:90%
going to be affected?

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns them off
from getting health care.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If you need health care, you
don't even want to go get it

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.200 align:middle line:84%
if you have to go through
all those hassles.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to be pushed by my
mother to go because I refused.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really
refused to go over

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.800 align:middle line:84%
there and be hassled and
looked upon like I'm nobody.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:90%
I am somebody.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I may not have that much
money, but I am somebody.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm me.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that wound
is still around.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:90%


00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the wound is still
actually being scraped over

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.270 align:middle line:84%
as newer and newer and newer
iterations of contraception

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:90%
come about.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:90%
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, hey.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:10%
Did I tell you?

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.540 align:middle line:10%
My doctor told me about this
new low-dose birth control

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:10%
pill called Yaz.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yaz was the first oral
contraceptive to win FDA

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:84%
approval not just for preventing
pregnancy but for treating acne

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.992 align:middle line:84%
and the severe
premenstrual symptoms.

00:45:13.992 --> 00:45:15.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Yaz can also help when
it comes to that time

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.580 align:middle line:10%
of the month.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>> What's unique about Yaz is
that this was the first time

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.200 align:middle line:10%
that commercials
stepped onto the scene,

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:10%
promising us better health
beyond just controlling

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.730 align:middle line:10%
your reproductive health.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.640 align:middle line:84%
This hormonal birth control
could solve all your lady part

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.510 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:35.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Proven to treat the emotional
and physical premenstrual

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.252 align:middle line:10%
symptoms that are severe.

00:45:36.252 --> 00:45:39.450 align:middle line:10%
>> But the ads actually promised
much more than what the FDA had

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:40.250 align:middle line:10%
approved it for.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.860 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It started the summer
she came home from college.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:10%
We took her to my gynecologist
to discuss birth control

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:10%
options.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.870 align:middle line:84%
She said she put
me on the new pill.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be
great because not only is

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.920 align:middle line:84%
this protection
against pregnancy,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to
prevent against PMS.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
help with my acne.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.430 align:middle line:90%
This was the miracle pill.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
She was returning
with her groceries,

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.240 align:middle line:84%
walking up to the third floor
of her apartment building.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:84%
She collapsed on the
second floor level.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> A very large clot had broken
loose somewhere from her lower

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.380 align:middle line:84%
extremities and had
gone to her heart.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You ask yourself, why does
something like this happen?

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke with
our friends who

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:84%
we were staying with
whose sister happened

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.370 align:middle line:90%
to be a physician.

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:47.330 align:middle line:84%
The first thing she said
to us was, was she on Yaz?

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And we said no.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.570 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't on Yaz.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:54.815 align:middle line:84%
But we found out that Loryna
was a generic version of Yaz.

00:46:54.815 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem is that it's the
fourth-generation progesterone

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.150 align:middle line:90%
called drospirenone.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And drospirenone,
for some reason,

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:09.820 align:middle line:10%
has a much higher
risk for a blood clot

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:10%
and stroke and
pulmonary embolism

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.930 align:middle line:10%
than the previous
generation pills.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The earlier generations
went off patent.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't a lot of
money to be made there.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:27.330 align:middle line:84%
If they came out with a new
generation, a new progestin,

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that was considered
a brand drug.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.050 align:middle line:90%
It was not a generic drug.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.090 align:middle line:84%
They would then have
patent protection.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And they could then charge more
so that the company could say,

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I have something better.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But better doesn't always
mean that it's safer.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:47.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The FDA approves drugs only
for a short period of time,

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.370 align:middle line:10%
like six weeks for
acute use of the drug.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:54.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's up to the
manufacturer to report

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.700 align:middle line:10%
any adverse reactions.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.101 align:middle line:84%
So what manufacturer who's
making billions of dollars

00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:05.540 align:middle line:84%
has any incentive to
report an adverse reaction?

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>> 65% of a pharmaceutical
company's budget is

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:10%
on advertising.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It's on marketing.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not on research
and development.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not on safety studies.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Who says all birth control
pills have to be the same?

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Who says?

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.505 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's usually where
the problem is happening.

00:48:20.505 --> 00:48:22.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's at that level of
the pharmaceutical industry

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.595 align:middle line:10%
of let's ignore the risks.

00:48:24.595 --> 00:48:26.720 align:middle line:10%
Let's give women what they
want or think they want.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.928 align:middle line:10%
Or let's sell them something
that they might not even

00:48:28.928 --> 00:48:30.390 align:middle line:10%
know they want or need.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the bottom line.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of the most popular
pills on the market today.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.860 align:middle line:10%
But our reporting
suggests that using it

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.350 align:middle line:10%
can increase the risk of
dangerous side effects

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:40.940 align:middle line:10%
that may even cause death.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Research shows the pills
are linked with a higher risk

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.940 align:middle line:10%
for blood clots.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.900 align:middle line:10%
So the FDA is stepping
in, holding a hearing

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.560 align:middle line:10%
to talk about these
health concerns.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.730 align:middle line:10%
>> The twofold increase in
risk for venous thromboembolism

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:02.780 align:middle line:10%
in drospirenone is deemed an
acceptable risk and has been

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:06.170 align:middle line:10%
deemed an acceptable
risk in the past.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Planned Parenthood was
speaking in favor of keeping

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.370 align:middle line:84%
the products on the market
because of this notion that

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.820 align:middle line:84%
the more options we
have, the better.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But why is our risk tolerance
so high for something

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that is preventive,
that is going to impact,

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:29.730 align:middle line:84%
for all intents and purposes,
healthy individuals?

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Our daughter died from Yaz.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.960 align:middle line:10%
Study after study,
including the FDA study,

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.780 align:middle line:10%
have shown for years that
DSRP kills and seriously harms

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:10%
significantly more women than
other birth control pills.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Internal company documents
stated there was an increased

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:90%
risk of blood clots.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.810 align:middle line:10%
But that statement was
not passed on to the FDA.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:53.900 align:middle line:84%
They downplayed the bad news
that showed safety problems

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.370 align:middle line:90%
and highlighted the good news.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:59.270 align:middle line:10%
And in my opinion, what
made this problematic

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.430 align:middle line:10%
was that they marketed
the drug saying

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.610 align:middle line:10%
that it worked for PMS
without the evidence,

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.890 align:middle line:10%
thereby convincing
women to switch

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.520 align:middle line:10%
to a potentially more dangerous
and more expensive drug.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Had all this information
come to my desk,

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I do not think that I would
have approved this drug.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The Kessler report was
not allowed to be given

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to the panel based
on a technicality.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:28.150 align:middle line:84%
After testimony, the
panel voted 15 to 11

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to keep the products
on the market.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It was later revealed that
4 out of the 15 panelists

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:39.150 align:middle line:84%
who voted Yes had ties to Bayer
that they hadn't disclosed.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.755 align:middle line:10%
>> We used to
believe in the FDA.

00:50:40.755 --> 00:50:42.520 align:middle line:10%
>> We used to.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> But we don't anymore.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The more we learn
about it, the more

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.520 align:middle line:84%
we realize that
the drug companies

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.440 align:middle line:90%
pay to get their drugs through.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:90%
They have one interest in mind.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.360 align:middle line:90%
And that is making money.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Bayer had put aside
money to cover

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:84%
the costs of the litigation
in the United States.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And the settlements that they
had expected, over $500 million

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:07.940 align:middle line:90%
in order to cover that.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that
was their stockholders

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:90%
said, yeah, you got it covered.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.590 align:middle line:90%
Your stocks went up.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is, is the FDA

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:84%
promoting the safety of
the American people or

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.665 align:middle line:84%
are they promoting the safety of
drug company and medical device

00:51:22.665 --> 00:51:23.465 align:middle line:90%
company profits?

00:51:23.465 --> 00:51:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:30.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, chances are you've
quickly skimmed the warning

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.820 align:middle line:10%
label of potential side effects
without thinking about it that

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:10%
much.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.050 align:middle line:10%
But in the case of
22-year-old Brittany,

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:40.000 align:middle line:10%
that warning label
became a tragic reality.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Nothing will
ever fill that void.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.750 align:middle line:10%
I understand that.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:10%
And I know that NuvaRing came
out and offered a settlement

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.290 align:middle line:10%
with families that
have been hurt by this.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:10%
What's your involvement
in the NuvaRing lawsuit?

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't want their money.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.720 align:middle line:10%
We want them to do what's right.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.820 align:middle line:10%
We want them to fully
disclose the risks associated

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:01.990 align:middle line:10%
with this product.

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:04.638 align:middle line:10%
>> The FDA told us, "Based
on the FDA's review,

00:52:04.638 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:10%
which included several studies
looking at the blood clot risk

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:10%
associated with NuvaRing, we
believe that the current label

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:12.893 align:middle line:10%
appropriately addresses this
risk and includes information

00:52:12.893 --> 00:52:15.310 align:middle line:10%
about the product that will
allow patients and health-care

It doesn't matter.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, because it's going

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:00.950 align:middle line:84%
If you gave them
the information,

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.840 align:middle line:90%
they'd say yes or no.

response about the Yaz drug

it's wrecking women's bodies

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.330 align:middle line:10%
by putting synthetic hormones
in them that men, by the way,

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:12.440 align:middle line:10%
don't want to take, right?

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>> But by the same token,
the right comes along

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:18.770 align:middle line:10%
because they're so against
reproductive access that

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.520 align:middle line:10%
if the left says anything, the
right takes it and warps it.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
continual escalation

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of no one talking about what
needs to be talked about

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and everybody entrenched
in their own sides.

>> I hear from Lila and people
like Lila that their ultimate

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:37.040 align:middle line:10%
intent is to actually decrease
the number of abortions.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And yet we're blocking
all of the things

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.320 align:middle line:10%
that we know actually
do allow women

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.210 align:middle line:10%
to make informed
choices on the front end

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.190 align:middle line:10%
and prevent unintended
pregnancies.

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:50.120 align:middle line:10%
>> And so by
maintaining that fight,

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:55.700 align:middle line:10%
it puts a veil over what can be
known or talked about in that

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.135 align:middle line:10%

to use education

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.380 align:middle line:84%

fertility awareness method

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to focus
on the informed choice

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:51.340 align:middle line:84%

then bring in these things.

unless we went to as many places
as we could in this country

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:12.713 align:middle line:84%
and heard what people
were going through.

00:59:12.713 --> 00:59:15.130 align:middle line:84%

But the most
important thing to us

is that people know
that they have options.

00:59:19.412 --> 00:59:21.980 align:middle line:84%
We want to move away from
fear-based education.

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.132 align:middle line:84%

We recommend knowing
you're normal.

00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:29.465 align:middle line:84%

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having my back.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:59:45.812 --> 00:59:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.855 align:middle line:84%
>> There's this idea that you
can get pregnant any time.

00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Part of dispelling some of that
fear and part of addressing it

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is just looking at
what's actually there.

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of brings me to
fertility awareness method.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:05.080 align:middle line:90%


01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The fertility awareness-based
methods are observational.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.660 align:middle line:84%
They're based on what's
actually happening

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.420 align:middle line:90%
in your body in any given cycle.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.790 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of advanced sex ed.

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:17.200 align:middle line:10%
How does my body work?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.880 align:middle line:10%
What is this stuff
coming out of me?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.710 align:middle line:84%
How many days per
month am I fertile?

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:22.900 align:middle line:90%
How long does an egg live?

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Each and every morning,
I take my temperature.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And I circle the
temperature on this graph.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And we connect the dots.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
When I do finally ovulate, my
temperature spikes noticeably.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
signs you're looking for.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You're also monitoring
fluids that you're producing.

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So everything should
correlate when

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%
you're plotting all this info.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a lot more
control over your body

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
rather than relying on a
big pharmaceutical company

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
for something to
prevent pregnancy.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.020 align:middle line:10%
>> With perfect use, meaning
if somebody would take

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.590 align:middle line:10%
their temperature every
day, check their cervix,

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.350 align:middle line:10%
look at their cervical fluid
every day and record it

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:15.190 align:middle line:10%
perfectly, then it
can be 99% accurate.

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>> You're only fertile
for four or five days,

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.610 align:middle line:10%
six days out of 32-day cycle.

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:24.490 align:middle line:10%
>> When I discovered that I
can't get pregnant every single

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:27.080 align:middle line:10%
day of my cycle, it
totally blew my mind.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.490 align:middle line:10%
And I felt in my case, it really
put the power in my hands.

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:35.200 align:middle line:10%
>> To me, the most feminist
approach to the conversation

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.010 align:middle line:10%
around contraceptives
period is options.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think if young women were
learning about their cycles

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
not from a contraceptive lens
but from an empowerment lens,

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
we could see a lot of
different things happening.

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:57.710 align:middle line:90%


01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:03.590 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a conference that
is very, very long overdue.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.150 align:middle line:10%
There really is
so much that needs

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:07.130 align:middle line:10%
to be understood about
contraceptives that we

01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:10.190 align:middle line:10%
could fill an entire week
of lectures and discussions.

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:13.010 align:middle line:10%
What I keep coming back
to, however, is the notion

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:15.620 align:middle line:10%
that if I can teach you how
to think about hormones,

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.690 align:middle line:10%
then each of you can
find your own answers

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.240 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps contribute
back to the knowledge base

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.240 align:middle line:10%
so that we can all have a better
understanding of these issues.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.350 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.150 align:middle line:90%


01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for coming.

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you
for what your--

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.865 align:middle line:90%
your research is incredible.

01:02:32.865 --> 01:02:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything you do.

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I highlighted more than I
didn't highlight of the things

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:38.010 align:middle line:90%
you--

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of the things you wrote.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
I have been to something

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:47.780 align:middle line:90%
like this with other parents.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:53.330 align:middle line:10%
People are beginning to hear it
and beginning to understand it.

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been collaborating with
Karen and Rick and with Michael

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and Jane Alexander to figure
out, how do we spread the word?

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
very big challenge.

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:05.600 align:middle line:10%
The system just protects
the pharmaceuticals

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.440 align:middle line:10%
so well that it's tough
to get anything done.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.830 align:middle line:84%
To get anything in front of
FDA is extremely difficult.

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're just trying
to figure out now

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.790 align:middle line:90%
how we can make a difference.

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So you see deaths,
hospitalization,

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and then the amount
of prescriptions.

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I actually
have some graphs.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't
include them here.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.100 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to give--

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> This is fantastic.

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Just fact finding, right?

01:03:32.033 --> 01:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's just
digging through.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is stuff
that should have been

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
readily available to anybody--

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --who looked and
to all the physicians.

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> You should have seen how hard
it was just to get this from

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.540 align:middle line:90%
the FDA.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand it.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I want it to be validated
by somebody that's credible

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:47.908 align:middle line:84%
because the first thing that's
going to happen if I publish

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.260 align:middle line:90%
this, Joe is a grieving father.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.468 align:middle line:90%
He has no medical background.

01:03:50.468 --> 01:03:51.927 align:middle line:84%
>> They're going
to do that anyway.

01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:52.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Piece of crap.

01:03:52.737 --> 01:03:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> They'll do that anyway.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do that to
whomever actually validates it.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
If you have a $17 billion a
year market already that's

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
out there using it regularly,
why would you do any of this?

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And so to get this
information out there,

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
it really relies on
folks like yourself.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We had a discussion last
night about side effects.

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And you said, your daughter
didn't have any side effects.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
That's what we thought until
we started looking back

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%

Exactly.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
There you have it.

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.830 align:middle line:10%
I was inspired to jump
into women's health

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.230 align:middle line:10%
after going through my own
frustrating series of women's

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:33.000 align:middle line:10%
health care issues,
intricately connected

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.430 align:middle line:10%
to the struggle of finding
the right birth control

01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:37.900 align:middle line:10%
as a problem and solution.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.358 align:middle line:84%
I started to solve one
problem, which was just

01:11:40.358 --> 01:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
to help women find the
right birth control,

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and realized how, ironically,
that was this integral question

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and challenge connected
to so many other issues

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that women face
around their health.

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:54.390 align:middle line:10%
Then three years
later, we have a fully

operating brick-and-mortar

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.990 align:middle line:10%
practice that's
trying to redefine

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.025 align:middle line:10%
what women's health is.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Moritz.

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:09.980 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
After 30 some years
of delivering babies,

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for a way
to continue that but more

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
in the gynecology side, I
see the younger people now

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.590 align:middle line:84%
actually wanting to avoid
hormonal contraception.

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:26.660 align:middle line:10%
And I think it has to
do with the entire idea

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.850 align:middle line:10%
of eating right.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And everything that goes into
their body, they think about.

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've had a lot of issues
my whole life with my cycle

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and my period.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.940 align:middle line:90%
I was irregular always.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.720 align:middle line:10%
So at 14, they put me on
birth control to regulate me.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
With me getting
liver lesions, now I

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.160 align:middle line:90%
have this aversion towards it.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hormones are so complex.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saying
to me, Dr. McClellan,

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
do you think hormonal
contraception has side effects,

01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:01.040 align:middle line:90%
absolutely, for sure.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Then why should I take it?

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to take it.

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, can you avoid pregnancy
not using any hormone

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:09.350 align:middle line:10%
contraception?

01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:10.610 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:11.870 align:middle line:10%
It takes more work.

01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:15.260 align:middle line:10%
You have to be really
thoughtful, double barrier,

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.800 align:middle line:10%

sort of ovulatory window

do with zero options.

management consultant.

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And my wife at night
was waking me up

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and was complaining that
she had cramps in her leg.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
She went to doctors and finally
some homeopath asked her

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
if she was taking the pill.

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And she was saying, what else?

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:26.770 align:middle line:10%
He said, well,
leave off the pill.

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And after a few weeks,
those cramps disappeared.

This is Daysy.

So I'll pass it around and
everybody can have a look.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.672 align:middle line:84%
Daysy has its own thermometer,
which I think is really cool.

You press it and you take
your temperature every day.

And none of them seem
to be a very good fit.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.690 align:middle line:10%
My dream was, what
if I could just know

01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:43.430 align:middle line:10%
exactly where I am in my cycle?

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.435 align:middle line:84%
Then I would know which
few days per cycle I

01:15:45.435 --> 01:15:46.310 align:middle line:90%
have to use a condom.

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:48.602 align:middle line:84%
That would be fine instead
of having to go and navigate

01:15:48.602 --> 01:15:50.910 align:middle line:90%
that question every time.

01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So we built an app, which is
kind of a general tracking app.

01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And people used it
to get pregnant.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.740 align:middle line:84%
People used it to understand
when the next period is coming.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They used it for many
different reasons.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I think if you come
with a full data set

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to your doctor,
you are enabling your doctor

01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:06.390 align:middle line:90%
to do a great job.

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a very
empowering thing that women

01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
can actually come and
not just be an average

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%

We have the #MeToo movement.

her hand in eugenics,

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
the legacy of her hand

can actually be the stand that
it is in community, right,

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:23.530 align:middle line:84%
creating access while also
being held accountable

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
for past harms.

01:18:28.907 --> 01:18:29.050 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some things
that they follow, of course.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But the cultures
and the communities

01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
play a huge impact in that.

01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the recognition,
which is great,

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.127 align:middle line:90%
I think is just the first step.

01:18:40.127 --> 01:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%

the work is moving forward.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I think, again, it's
the what's next, right?

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
After accountability
has been claimed,

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
how do we ensure
sustained accountability?

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And how do we ensure community
voice is always heard?

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:17.440 align:middle line:10%
In the 1990s, you had
a group of Black women

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.970 align:middle line:10%
who began a reproductive
justice movement.

01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:25.200 align:middle line:10%
Loretta Ross is one of the
more well-known activists.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And what they're really doing is
holding these doctors but also

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the medical establishment
responsible for the damage

01:19:34.050 --> 01:19:35.850 align:middle line:90%
that they're ultimately doing.

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:37.520 align:middle line:10%

>> That's the frontier that
we're involved in right now

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
in terms of feminists who are
fighting around birth control.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to the United State
of Women, the first major event.

01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I was there for my work as a
reproductive health advocate.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.450 align:middle line:84%
When they said,
reproductive rights,

01:19:57.450 --> 01:20:00.360 align:middle line:84%
which was one of the huge
banners, all they were talking

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.130 align:middle line:90%
about was birth control.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was birth control and
abortion, one or the other,

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but what about
women's wellness and everything

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that it takes for us to
actually live healthy?

hormonal contraceptives without

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.730 align:middle line:10%

it's not liberating for me.

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not liberating
for my community.

01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> How we address birth control
should be a larger conversation

01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that's part of a larger
broad-based women's movement.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
We should be looking at
the reproductive life

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
cycle of a woman, which
includes pregnancy, birth,

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
loss, breastfeeding.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really gather
women under the same umbrella

01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:44.940 align:middle line:90%
to have these conversations.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, reproductive
justice instead puts people

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:52.140 align:middle line:84%
at the center, not a
product, not a procedure.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And it's really
about women's rights

01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:57.750 align:middle line:10%
not only to, quote unquote,
control their body,

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:03.600 align:middle line:10%
but to have a healthy body, to
enjoy their body, to protect

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.400 align:middle line:10%
their body.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.070 align:middle line:10%

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.020 align:middle line:10%
contraceptives.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.687 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to you that that
is a political issue, that this

01:21:14.687 --> 01:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
is a social issue,
that right now, we

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.640 align:middle line:90%
need to be less accommodating.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.760 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the more popular
methods of birth control is

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.710 align:middle line:10%
the pill, according to the CDC.

01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:28.400 align:middle line:10%
But the number of women using
it appears to be going down.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.800 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a lot of concern
about putting anything

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.430 align:middle line:10%
artificial in your body.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:35.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think that has leading
to some fear about hormones.

chemicals, ECBs,

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.680 align:middle line:10%

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:06.350 align:middle line:10%
endocrine disruptors, which are
what are in these birth control

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:10.670 align:middle line:10%

destroying the foundation

01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:14.400 align:middle line:10%
