00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you have
the Big Bang theory,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the universe
started from a sub-Planck

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:90%
length and an explosion ensued.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, billions
of years later, we're all here.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, the question is
when scientists measure

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
this event in time value, they
measure the first millionth

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
of a second after the Big Bang.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:10%
They measure the first
100,000ths of a second and all

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.330 align:middle line:10%
the way to the first second
and beyond as if somebody was

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:10%
watching.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
If there were no
organic lifeforms

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.270 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the Big Bang,
was there a consciousness?

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Was the universe self-aware?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Did the universe itself
see the Big Bang?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Did it hear it?

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Did it feel it?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And if there was nobody
there, then how could

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:90%
it have happened?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
The big question is
about the Big Bang,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
was there the big
consciousness first?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Did anybody see it?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And if this consciousness saw
it then and experienced the Big

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Bang, then where is this
consciousness today?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Are there fields of awareness
in the fabric of space itself?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Is there a consciousness
beyond the physical?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Is this the secret
to enlightenment?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And can scientists verify
that the field of awareness

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
actually exists and
preexisted the Big Bang?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:90%

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
6.6 billion people, one planet,
one global consciousness.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Why do we experience suffering?

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Why is there war?

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
What is our true
potential to become

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
enlightened, individually
and as a civilization?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:90%
What was the fall from grace?

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:90%
How do we become free again?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Over 9 million people worldwide
are incarcerated in prisons.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
3.3 billion of the
world's populations

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
live in cities
geometrically designed

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to serve and to enslave us in
perpetual debt and inflation

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:90%
economics.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
is there a matrix?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Is there a proverbial
prison for our minds?

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:90%
What is the matrix?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
In mathematics, it is a
rectangular array of numbers

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:90%
considered as a single entity.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:10%
A matrix is distinguished by
the number of rows and columns

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:10%
it contains--

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:10%
a building, house, or city.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
The deeper level of the matrix
is that we are the matrix.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:10%
It is a simulation created
by the architect of our minds

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:10%
to entertain us while we suffer.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
All that we know as real
is actually a simulation

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
of reality, our inner reality.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
The real question is how do we
attain freedom from the matrix,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
transform our minds,
and attain liberation?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Every time a home
doubles in price,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
people will have to drive
their cars twice as much

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to make more money
to pay for it.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
In 1988, as a nation, Americans
drove 1.5 trillion miles.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
By 2007, that figure has doubled
to nearly 3 trillion miles

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:90%
per year.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
That means doubling greenhouse
gas emissions, air pollution,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
oil production, and more
wars are fought over oil.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Everything costs
more, and inflation

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:90%
chases the proverbial rabbit.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Is there a prison for our minds?

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, human beings suffer
from more and more depression

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.690 align:middle line:84%
than at any other
time in our history.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
heart disease is the number one
cause of death in the world,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
killing over 7.2
million people per year.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
In the United States
of America, there

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
were 1.4 billion prescriptions
for antidepressants.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Millions of those were for
children under the age of 18.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The numbers of severely
depressed human beings

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:84%
goes far beyond those that
are taking medication for it.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
1 million people worldwide
commit suicide every year.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
What is the answer
to our total freedom?

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Is the answer hidden deep inside
of the mystical experience?

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Is the answer to our
enlightenment available now?

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Over 2000 BC, Judaism
begins with a covenant

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:90%
between God and Abraham.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Its lineage goes
back even farther

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
to the time of Genesis, of Adam
and Eve, the birth of humanity.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Before 2200 BC, Krishna, the
Hindu incarnation of God,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
taught the way to total
freedom from suffering

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and the attainment of a non-dual
reality filled with inner voice

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and inner realization.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
By 1500 to 1200 BC, the
Hindu Vedic teachings

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
began, giving the foundations
for perpetual liberation

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
through the deep science
of mantra, sound,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and the true nature
of the mind and God.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth century
BC, Pythagoras

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
taught a lineage of an awakening
of intelligence, enlightenment

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that influenced many of the
great mystics and scholars,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
from Plato to Socrates,
creating the foundations

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
of the true democratic and
evolved political processes.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth century BC,
Gautama the Buddha's first words

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
upon attaining
nirvana while sitting

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
under the Bodhi Tree
in deep meditation was,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
"There is suffering."

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
He then taught an
eightfold path that

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
leads to the cessation and
transcendence of suffering

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:90%
by attaining enlightenment.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
For those who attain it, they
become Buddhas, Tathagatas,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:90%
or Fully Enlightened Ones.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:84%
In the Common Era, Jesus
and his mother Mary

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:84%
taught a way to end violence,
attain the kingdom of heaven

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
within, and wipe every
tear from every eye.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:84%
For his saints, such as
Saint Teresa of Avila,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Bernadette of Lourdes,
Francis of Assisi,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Dante Alighieri,
Emanuel Swedenborg,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
there was the attainment
of enlightenment.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
For his faithful
followers, there

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is the bountiful
new paradise earth.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Today, global destruction of the
ecology, war, disease, death,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
oppression, depression,
and enlightenment all

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
exist at the same time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Humanity now faces
a critical juncture.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
What if we can attain
enlightenment individually,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
one light bulb at a time?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
What if humanity can
survive all the challenges

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:84%
it faces and live in an
age of sustainability?

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
What if humanity,
with the awakening

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of deeper intelligence
and enlightenment,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
can advance science
to the point that they

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
can enter an
interstellar community

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and meet with other
civilizations?

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
What have we lost by
turning our backs away

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:84%
from the deep mystical
teachings, practices,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and experience inside of
all of our own religions?

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Can it help guide us to an
awakening of intelligence

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to end war, depression,
disease, and help guide us

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.222 align:middle line:84%
on our journey towards
a new civilization?

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Considering global
warming, sewage pollution,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:10%
and the "Inconvenient
Truth" of Al Gore,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:10%
the proof that we may be heading
towards a mass extinction event

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:10%
through either global
warming causing an ice age--

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:10%
>> --or, two, global warming
causing massive virus

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:10%
outbreaks, what is the Tibetan
Buddhist view on an exodus from

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:10%
a planet?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.666 align:middle line:10%
If we destroy this planet
and we are psychologically

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:10%
and ecologically involved
in its destruction,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:10%
where do 6 and 1/2
billion souls go?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Where do they find a new home
if they seek reincarnation?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, from the
point of view of the Buddhists,

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:90%
the planet is not destroyed.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Even though we are trashing
it, we will come to our senses,

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
they predict, and it
will not be destroyed.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We may go through more
hardships and so on.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But a total ice age,
or a total meltdown,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or a nuclear holocaust
is not going to happen,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.222 align:middle line:90%
according to their predictions.

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:16.680 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that's so, but it

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:90%
means that's what they think.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's point one.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I always thought ever
since of the Death Star

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
incident in "Star Wars" where
Obi-Wan and Luke are flying

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, and then there's
a shudder and a disturbance

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
in the Force because the
Death Star has actually

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:84%
destroyed a particular planet
with many billions of souls

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.056 align:middle line:84%
on it, and Obi-Wan
shudders, you know?

00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But I was taught that in
the Buddhist cosmology,

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
there's billions and trillions
and countless numbers

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of planets with
humanoid beings on them.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
We've been on many other
planets many times.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We will be on many other
planets many other times.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.054 align:middle line:84%
And we will, therefore,
all the souls of any--

00:09:58.054 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
if a whole planet was destroyed
in a supernova Death Star,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
their souls would be
reborn other places.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:10%
And we ourselves have been
through many Big Bangs and Big

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:10%
Crunches, all
beings, because life

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:10%
is beginningless from the
point of view of the Buddhists.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there's always
more places to live.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
However, the sort
of archangels, you

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
could say, the Bodhisattvas,
the compassionate beings who

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:84%
are making a huge
effort although they

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:90%
didn't create the world.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't create, and
they don't control people

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
On a relative sense, they're
quite powerful in they're

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:84%
trying to arrange
circumstances for living beings

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
to be optimal for them to
wake up and become themselves

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Bodhisattvas and
become enlightened.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So from a Buddhist
point of view,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
they will do a lot
in their power,

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and they do have considerable
power, to prevent us

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:90%
from destroying ourselves.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the way we behave

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, our
governments and everything,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and our chauvinistic, especially
male chauvinist habits,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
having had nuclear weapons
now for over 50 years, that we

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
haven't killed
each other totally

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or had a nuclear holocaust
is in itself a miracle.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And that Tibetan Buddhists
would argue this miracle

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:90%
is not really a miracle.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.454 align:middle line:84%
It is the miraculous activity
of enlightened angelic beings.

00:11:13.454 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:10%
But not an
omnipotent-- they don't

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.474 align:middle line:10%
believe in an omnipotent
deity that absolutely controls

00:11:17.474 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:10%
everything because
then you'd have

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:10%
to blame the bad
situation on that deity.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> On a god.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's illogical.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:90%
That's very irrational.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But that there are these
powerful angelic forces seeing

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to it that we continue
to learn our lessons,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that we use this theater of life
to evolve in an optimal, mostly

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
rapid way toward
our enlightenment,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that is what the Mahayana
Buddhists would believe.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, when you
read mystical experiences,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:10%
it appears it's far out there,
so difficult to achieve it some

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:10%
way in a distant world.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to as an
experience, it is so real.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:90%
It's so real.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It's such a simple and
practical thing to be.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
There is one rule
for those who are

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
go into deep
experiences of samahdi,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're not supposed
to share it with others.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
You know the reason?

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the student
starts imagining

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that type of state or start
craving for that state.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And that craving for a
particular experience

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:84%
becomes an impediment in
getting that experience.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.866 align:middle line:10%
>> So many stories
of an enlightenment,

00:12:41.866 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:10%
you see yourself on forest.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:10%
You hear your voice on
dripping sound or chirping

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:10%
birds or breeze.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.215 align:middle line:10%
You see yourself outside of you.

00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:10%
That is moment of
extra enlightenment.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't belong to
this body and mind.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:10%
>> We have all the major
religions in the world share

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:10%
their near-death experiences
with it some point or another,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:10%
including atheists, including
people with no religion.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:10%
It's true.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:10%
Even atheists, even
people who absolutely

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:10%
profess no belief
in God whatsoever

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:10%
can have near-death experiences.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And when atheists have
near-death experiences,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
they're just like the near-death
experiences of everybody else.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:84%
They're positive, blissful, have
the same sequence of elements.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, for
atheists, after they

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
have this type of
near-death experience,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.576 align:middle line:84%
it's almost impossible for them
to continue to be atheists.

00:13:37.576 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Time and time again we've
had people that will say,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.326 align:middle line:90%
hey, I was an atheist.

00:13:41.326 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I had this near-death
experience.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And, wow, I had to
change my beliefs.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand there
is a higher power.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I understand there is a god.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's
an afterlife.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's much,
much more to my consciousness

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:90%
than I ever realized.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
impossible for someone

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to continue to cling to
those atheist beliefs

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
after they've had such
a profound experience

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:90%
as a near-death experience.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was sitting in my
old house in Redondo Beach

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
on the couch, just
sort of by myself,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
not doing much of anything,
just sort of thinking.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up
towards our stairs.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.944 align:middle line:10%
And I saw-- it was the most kind
of amazing thing I'd ever seen.

00:14:18.944 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:10%
It would be as if there
was a dimensional warp

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.693 align:middle line:10%
or something opened.

00:14:21.693 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:10%
There was like a sparkling.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:10%
And then out of that
sparkling appeared my father.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:10%
But he was in his
absolute prime.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:90%
He passed away when he was 79.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
In this vision, he was maybe
35 to 38, something like that,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
and smiling and grinning.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.244 align:middle line:90%
And I could see--

00:14:42.244 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I sort of went
with the experience

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
because I was so
shocked that I saw him.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I could see through him,
and yet it was there.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So it was obviously an
apparition of some sort.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.494 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was his spirit,
yet he was very real.

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And I could certainly
make out that it was him

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and had the whole--

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, his whole
body actually appeared.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:10%
And as he kind of floated
down the stairs towards me,

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm in shock.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:90%
And I go, Dad?

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, you were
right, you big stinker.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And I laughed.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And what that was in
relationship to is,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:10%
over the years, we'd had an
ongoing debate about life

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:10%
after death.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:10%
And my own experience
was and my belief

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:10%
was that there is more to life
and that the spirit certainly

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:10%
survives the shell of the body.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:10%
And he was very agnostic
at best, if not an atheist,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:10%
and said, no, I don't
believe any of it.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're
dead, you're dead.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And he comes over, and
he basically sits down

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%
at the other end of the couch.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.332 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going with
this not believing

00:15:36.332 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:90%
that it's actually happening.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:10%
And yet it's happening.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:10%
And we then in
the next half hour

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:10%
or so, time kind of stopped.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:10%
I don't really know
how long it was,

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:10%
but it seemed like
not enough time.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:10%
And yet I was able to
tell him all of my hurts,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:10%
and things that we
didn't experience,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:10%
and how come you
did certain things?

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to tell
me that he was sorry

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and how much he had loved me.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was the kind of
intimacy and exchange--

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I might get tears
in my eyes again--

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
where he opened in a
way that he could never

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
do when we were alive.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
We never had this
kind of an experience.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And right at the key
moment where I really felt

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
a sense of love
and companionship

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
with him that I had never
felt, he started to fade away.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And he started to, like,
sort of move up into the air.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And I go, Dad, and I was crying.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dad, don't go.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't go.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.186 align:middle line:90%
And he continued to move up.

00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm watching him go up.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.934 align:middle line:84%
And that same kind
of a sparkling thing

00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
happened like I saw at the
top of the stairs originally.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And as he was kind of
fading away and moving

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
towards the ceiling, he
said, Michael, remember,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm only a thought away.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm only a thought away.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one
sort of faded out.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.464 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I'm only
a thought away.

00:16:50.464 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
The he went out
through the ceiling.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.331 align:middle line:90%
And then the sparkling stopped.

00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And here we are as
a biological system,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:84%
relatively tiny on a relatively
tiny planet in a relatively

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:84%
tiny solar system in a
relatively tiny galaxy compared

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
to the scope of the universe
that we can see through

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:90%
telescopes.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And yet this mind that exists in
our individual consciousnesses,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:10%
in each and every
one of us, this mind

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:10%
has the capability to envision
things as tiny as superstrings

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:10%
and go from the macro--

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the micro-micro up
through atoms, and molecules,

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:10%
and cells, and organs,
and people, and planets,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:10%
and solar systems,
and universes.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And literally, we
could imagine ourselves

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:10%
holding ourselves
envisioning the consciousness

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.556 align:middle line:10%
of everything.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusion I come to
is that our minds are bigger

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:90%
than the entire universe.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Our minds, our consciousness
has the capability

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:90%
to go from the small to the awe.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that capability
exists in every one of us.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
will we tap into it?

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Will we develop the skills to
be able to go from the micro

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:90%
to the macro?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Will we develop the skills
to be able to integrate

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:90%
all this information?

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the developing
the tools of consciousness

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.685 align:middle line:84%
becomes part of our
great challenge.

00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:30.495 align:middle line:84%
>> And he had been
saving them for-- well,

00:18:30.495 --> 00:18:33.864 align:middle line:84%
he had met Kirpal Singh 25 years
earlier when Kirpal Singh gave

00:18:33.864 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:90%
these to him.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:10%
So apparently, this
food is blessed.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:10%
And it holds some
example, or it--

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.105 align:middle line:10%
there's a spiritual energy put
into this food or any article,

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:46.905 align:middle line:10%
I believe.

00:18:46.905 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And they're called prasad.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, it is if
you eat this stuff,

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:56.664 align:middle line:10%
you'll get a spiritual
experience that somewhat--

00:18:56.664 --> 00:18:58.089 align:middle line:10%
I don't even know the intention.

00:18:58.089 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:10%
I guess the intention
is to encourage

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:10%
you to believe that there's
a spiritual dimension

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:10%
and this is some benefit to you.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.095 align:middle line:84%
So he offers me this
one grain of rice

00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that he's been
saving for 25 years.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting in his kitchen
at Santa Cruz, California.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was rather instantaneous.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.742 align:middle line:84%
He and I were both
seated at the same table.

00:19:26.742 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed as
though-- you know,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:84%
it seemed my consciousness
moved beyond my body.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And it went beyond the
kitchen we were in.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And it went beyond
the house we were in.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was very strange
because this part of me

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that I identify as myself,
like right here in this chair,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:84%
literally seemed
to go beyond this.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Like this vase
over here, I really

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:90%
felt like I was that vase.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.525 align:middle line:90%
You know, here's my arm.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:90%
That's definitely me.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But that was like
that vase was me too.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.325 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that, I
was becoming the walls

00:19:59.325 --> 00:20:00.125 align:middle line:90%
in the building.

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I was becoming the
buildings beyond the building.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was really frightening.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:90%
It was very frightening.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.794 align:middle line:90%
And it kept going.

00:20:06.794 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
the whole city.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of have the idea
of what was in the city.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Like-- and this sounds insane.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, it went
beyond the city.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:90%
It went beyond the world.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I felt as though
I was going into space

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and my consciousness was
expanding through space.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this sounds
crazy, of course.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, I got the idea
of inhabited worlds in space,

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
what they were like, and this
idea of the volume and vastness

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of space that I'd never
been able to comprehend

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:90%
before this time.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was absolutely
terrifying.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And it just kept going.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:90%
So this kept happening.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
We're expanding out to space
for, I guess, maybe 40 minutes.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're clutched onto the
corner of the kitchen table.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.965 align:middle line:84%
We're seated at the
table, and our arms

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
are wrapped around this table
holding on for dear life.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.654 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
put that in this,

00:21:00.654 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
but-- and tears are
dripping from our eyes

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.524 align:middle line:90%
to the table, both he and I.

00:21:05.524 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, are you
experiencing the same thing?

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:90%
He's over there nodding.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:90%
He can't really speak.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are just going, please,
we can't take it anymore.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.965 align:middle line:90%
Please, turn this off.

00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're believing Kirpal
Singh is a real entity.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got the idea,
and with a clear-- well,

00:21:20.735 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:90%
not the idea.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.929 align:middle line:84%
It was clear that Kirpal Singh
was responsible for this.

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It was though he was an entity
who was right there taking you

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:90%
on this journey.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And, oh, you couldn't see him.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
There was just-- the presence
of that was very real.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway,
essentially, we were just

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.143 align:middle line:84%
begging for him to
turn it off because we

00:21:40.143 --> 00:21:41.567 align:middle line:90%
thought we were gonna die.

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was the idea.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It was just you can't survive
this kind of experience

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.044 align:middle line:90%
without some trouble.

00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:50.418 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:50.418 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell where they were.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need
to preface that we

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:84%
were going through a
transformational change

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:10%
And we had started
seeing flashes

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:10%
of light, the experience that I
had had in my living room where

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:10%
I was reading the magazine.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And we had a two-way fireplace.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.195 align:middle line:10%
I was in one living room,
and the fireplace also

00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:10%
was two-way into the
other living room.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And all the lights were
off in the house except

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.333 align:middle line:90%
for my reading lamp.

00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was late at
night, and I was

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:90%
flipping through the magazine.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And through this time, I was
asking to see the angels.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I always had a lot of faith in
prayer and was doing healings,

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:90%
but I wanted to see them.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And so one evening,
I was flipping

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.605 align:middle line:84%
through just thinking
about the kids

00:22:39.605 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and what I was
going to get them.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:10%
And then I just
felt this presence.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:10%
And I slowly looked over to my
shoulder through the fireplace,

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and this amazing flash
of blue-white light,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:10%
like lightning bolts or
like about 50 light bulbs,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:10%
went off in the living
room and just flashed

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.716 align:middle line:10%
through the entire house.

00:22:55.716 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on,
the kids have started

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:90%
seeing the flashes of light.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And then we moved to Scottsdale.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
were experiencing

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:90%
the balls of light.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And we started having
more visions of angels.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So what color was
the ball of light?

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, mostly white
with a splash of gold.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
strange about it

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:84%
is that if I would have
something blocking my view,

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd usually get
really irritated.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But it was more
calming than ever.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What would get irritated?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, I'd be watching TV.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Then Alex would go
in front of the TV.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'd sort of get mad.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But it would sort
of be-- see, I'd

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
look at maybe a
chair or something.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And the light would
be in front of it,

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't really see it.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:90%
But it wouldn't bother me.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It was calming.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so it irritated you
if something got in front

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:90%
of the ball.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> The ball that--

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.166 align:middle line:84%
He's saying,
normally, if Alex got

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
in front of the TV,
that would irritate him.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.912 align:middle line:84%
But the balls of white
didn't irritate you.

00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:57.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they were calming.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It made--

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Mother--

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> So they were very calming.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Centering, they were
very centering, yeah.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.946 align:middle line:90%
>> They had a presence.

00:24:03.946 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Very centering, he said.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:05.646 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You felt a presence
with these balls of light.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>> How big were they?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Describe with your hands.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Um, like this.

00:24:12.996 --> 00:24:13.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:13.796 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's big.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:14.916 align:middle line:90%
>> That's big.

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:15.868 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pretty big.

00:24:15.868 --> 00:24:17.772 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were a
gold and white light.

00:24:17.772 --> 00:24:18.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:18.806 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you believe other
people could see these?

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think you're seeing
into the invisible world

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%
that people don't see?

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Um, I don't know.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there are
people more spiritual

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:90%
than me, like the monks.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they see them or--

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.391 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:24:37.391 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm
seeing something invisible

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.424 align:middle line:90%
to the most human.

00:24:42.424 --> 00:24:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So Alexandria, why don't you
tell about the bubbles of light

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:90%
that both you and Adam see?

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.252 align:middle line:84%
But you would see the
bubbles all the time.

00:24:50.252 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:84%
She would always
go to bed and say,

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.927 align:middle line:84%
I see the bubbles
that are around me.

00:24:54.927 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Every, like--
wherever I look,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and if I close my
eyes and open them,

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll see like a bubble or a
zig-zag of different colors,

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
red and blue, the
rainbow colors.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And if it's really dark, I'll
see a ton of little bubbles

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:90%
like that big.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.966 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be all over the
place just floating around.

00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:20.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:25:20.206 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm really blown away.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.464 align:middle line:90%
I want to see those bubbles.

00:25:24.464 --> 00:25:26.389 align:middle line:84%
Actually, only one time
in my life when I saw

00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
bubbles, and that's
when I was hypothermic.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.644 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:29.644 --> 00:25:31.108 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:34.524 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:34.524 --> 00:25:45.492 align:middle line:90%


00:25:45.492 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, first of all, let's
talk about what do we mean

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.584 align:middle line:90%
by invisible.

00:25:48.584 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll address this
to the question of apparitions

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and spirits and all other forms
of, quote, "invisible beings."

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:10%
What science has
taught us, which

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:10%
I find to be utterly
extraordinary,

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:10%
is that our visual experience,
which is totally brilliant,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:10%
only sees a tiny sliver of all
the vibrations of photons that

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:10%
exist in the known universe.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:10%
So if I look
outdoors, for example,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:10%
and I can see tens of thousands
of rocks, and tens of thousands

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:10%
of leaves, and
hundreds of thousands

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.060 align:middle line:10%
of hues of colors
and shapes and sizes,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:10%
it can fill my consciousness,
my visual consciousness,

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:10%
with all these details.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:10%
And yet all that complexity
and all that experience

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.705 align:middle line:10%
is more than--

00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how to explain
how tiny this sliver is.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Let me give an example
of how little we see.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:10%
If we imagine the size of
the Empire State Building

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:10%
as reflecting all the known
frequencies of light that

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:10%
exists in this room
right now, and then we

00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:10%
ask how much of those vibrations
can we see with our naked eye,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:10%
do we see 50 stories, 10
stories worth of the vibration?

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:90%
One story of the vibration?

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:90%
One foot of the vibration?

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
What science tells
us is the amount

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that we see in our
consciousness is

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:90%
smaller than the grain of sand.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we are seeing
with all this breadth is

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
a grain of sand compared to
the Empire State Building

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:90%
of vibration, of light.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So most things that exist
are called invisible to us.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.546 align:middle line:84%
Our senses are
extraordinarily limited.

00:27:35.546 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Our normal senses are
extraordinarily limited.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But we can go
beyond those senses

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
when we develop certain
higher forms of awareness

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:90%
We can also do it with science.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.435 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what science
can be thought of

00:27:47.435 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:84%
is the process of making
the invisible visible.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
We take frequencies
we cannot see.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And then we transform them.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We either increase
or decrease them

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and put them into the little
grain of sand of the spectrum

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:90%
that we can see.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden,
we can see the invisible

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:90%
with technology.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So once you become aware
that most of what exists

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.885 align:middle line:84%
is invisible-- and
it's all light.

00:28:12.885 --> 00:28:14.486 align:middle line:90%
It's all light.

00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about just the
vibrations of photons here.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Then the idea that there
could be apparitions,

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.476 align:middle line:84%
or there could be
angels, or there

00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
could be any number
of beings or processes

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
that are not part of
our everyday experience

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:84%
becomes extraordinarily
plausible.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We just have to then
use our technology

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to these processes,
these questions, these beings.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happening now in science.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to take this
super sensitive technology

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
developed for other purposes,
and we're applying it

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:90%
to these other realms.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> But if I'm sleeping, I can
go into like a different state

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness where
I wake up, but I won't.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:10%
My body might be awake.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:10%
I can see people
sitting on my bed.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:10%
And it always depends on
what state I'm in, as well,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:10%
or what types of energies
I'm attracting to me.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Now that I'm working
on a clear energy,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I usually attract
gods and things

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
like that who can communicate
to me through the night.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, so my aunt--

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:90%
actually, it was about--

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.860 align:middle line:84%
it happened when I
was 19 years old.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.155 align:middle line:84%
I'd been seeing spirits
on and off as a child

00:29:24.155 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but never really
taking it seriously.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
about 19 years old,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
my aunt had died probably
four years before that.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:10%
But I was going
through a tough stage.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
for a transition.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:90%
And one night, I was asleep.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And my body was
paralyzed, obviously,

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:84%
because your body goes into that
state sometimes when you sleep.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I must have
just been drifting off,

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was like my astral
body sat up out of my body.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking down
and seeing my body down there.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a lady
sitting on my window sill.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And she was a lot younger.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't communicate
verbally to her,

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:90%
but it was a telepathic thing.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.667 align:middle line:84%
I could tell that I was
connected with her thoughts,

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and she was connected with mine.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her in my
thoughts, who are you?

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I said that,
I got a flash of my auntie

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90%
when she was about 83 years old.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that was the
age when she died.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And then I knew that it was her.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So I started saying,
you know, why you here?

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.670 align:middle line:84%
What you need, to
give me a message?

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And she just started to
telepathically tell me

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that everything's
OK, and you need

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to move to Sydney, which
is across the other side

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:90%
of the country.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And there had been a few
thoughts come into my mind

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:84%
about wanting to move and
needing a transition because I

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
felt really stuck.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But because I was
so young, it was

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:84%
really hard to make
such a decision

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to move across the country.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So she kind of came to me, and
she guided me a little bit.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Then I just laid
back in my body.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up the next
morning, and I remembered it

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:90%
all so vividly.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of made me
make that grand a decision.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I left probably
about six months later.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So how did it affect
you to see someone?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did it confirm
for you that we live on,

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to see someone that
was your own relative?

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are skeptic out there

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.210 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they haven't
had the experience.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as a
child, I had a lot

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.056 align:middle line:90%
of those types of experiences.

00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But because older people and
parents and things like that,

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not really the
thing to believe.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I kind of shut it out.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But having a deep
experience like that,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and seeing my auntie
come to me, and actually

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
being able to come out
of my body and for it

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to be so real just really
reconfirmed it in my mind.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:84%
When I was little when we
first moved into Arizona,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I put my hand down by a
lizard, and the lizard just

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.612 align:middle line:90%
crawled onto me.

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:57.848 align:middle line:84%
And I just like animals
a lot, and I like

00:31:57.848 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:90%
to save their life sometimes.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think of Nuala?

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> She's cute.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> She's really happy with you.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.191 align:middle line:90%
She looks all blissed-out.

00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:12.488 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:12.488 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Alex, you just
saw a man in our house?

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Outside the bathroom window.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Right out-- oh, he
was outside the house?

00:32:23.752 --> 00:32:24.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:24.616 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you show me?

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Walk with me, and show me where.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:27.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Did he appear and disappear?

00:32:27.964 --> 00:32:28.764 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:32:28.764 --> 00:32:30.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I just saw him.

00:32:30.452 --> 00:32:34.104 align:middle line:84%
He was-- see that
big bush right there?

00:32:34.104 --> 00:32:34.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:34.904 --> 00:32:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The big, giant-- he was
sitting right under it.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Under this tree?

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Right to the right?

00:32:43.242 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> He's-- it was all
the way up there.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> All the way up there.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.124 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:50.124 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're drawing a
picture of him then.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:90%
You just saw him.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:53.113 --> 00:32:53.476 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:53.476 --> 00:32:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's go look at your picture
that you're gonna draw.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.694 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting
goosebumps like crazy.

00:32:57.694 --> 00:32:59.587 align:middle line:90%
Look at them.

00:32:59.587 --> 00:33:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Look at all my goosebumps.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:01.545 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't have any.

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you are.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.686 align:middle line:90%
I can go get some.

00:33:03.686 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I really want to do--

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.859 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got goosebumps.

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.324 align:middle line:90%
>> You'll teach her.

00:33:09.324 --> 00:33:11.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Here, draw feet.

00:33:11.296 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt a very Native Indian
presence the last time we were

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:90%
up in Sedona.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there a way for people--

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these invisible
cities like Shambhala.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, when
the mind is pure,

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:90%
do they actually see a city.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Shambhala's not a city.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Shambhala, supposedly,
is a country

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.530 align:middle line:90%
with 96 million inhabitants--

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --near the North Pole,
somewhere like in the North

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Pole area, surrounded by all
kind of rows of ice mountains

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and with a force field that
covers it that makes it

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:90%
invisible.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's a huge country.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And they have 96 provinces,
each one with a million citizens

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:90%
and 96 capitals.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.802 align:middle line:84%
The central one,
Kalapa, is there.

00:33:51.802 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
legend of Shambhala,

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that's what Shambhala
is, not like one city.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>> That's gonna
create confusion.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in the
Gobi and all that.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be somewhere like
in the north of Mongolia,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:84%
therefore, in the
North Pole area.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.520 align:middle line:90%
No, Shambhala's up there.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
In about 300-400 years,
apparently, the veil is lifted

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.795 align:middle line:90%
and we see Shambhala.

00:34:10.795 --> 00:34:11.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:34:11.595 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the Shambhala just
kind of help us out and get us

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:90%
past our phase of militarism.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the Dharma becomes
very widespread for about 1,800

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
years, supposedly.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> 300 or 400 years,
you said, from now?

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, 300 or
400 years from now.

00:34:23.238 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
>> From now, Shambhala
will reveal itself?

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.998 align:middle line:90%
And then it directs.

00:34:28.998 --> 00:34:30.914 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
little bit of a buffeting,

00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:32.009 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of a scrap.

00:34:32.009 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:90%
>> That's incredible.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And then like an Armageddon
type of scrap, but then,

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
basically, the whole
planet goes toward peace.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And there is a Golden Age
of 1,800 years, they say.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
But I can't imagine that it
would be only 1,800 years,

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:48.790 align:middle line:90%
but maybe.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very Golden Age
of people being very loving,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and developing wisdom, a lot of
education, a lot of meditation,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of spirituality, and
way past violence, equality

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:84%
of the genders, of the
sexes, male and female--

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.055 align:middle line:84%
no more male-dominated, but
also no female-dominated,

00:35:03.055 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:90%
but equality.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And a really wonderful
era, they believe,

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.210 align:middle line:90%
will ensue at that time.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always protesting
with the Tibetans

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that I think their calculations
are wrong because I don't think

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
the planet can last that
long under the present stress

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:90%
of militarism and exploitation.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:26.157 align:middle line:84%
And it should-- either they're
hiding the true calculation

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:27.240 align:middle line:90%
or the calculation is off.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Which would be sooner.

00:35:28.281 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And it should be
sooner, I feel, personally.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.103 align:middle line:90%
But that's just my own--

00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:33.983 align:middle line:90%
they just laugh when I say that.

00:35:33.983 --> 00:35:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama actually says
that he doesn't believe in it

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:84%
at all, that he's not into
prophecies, that people should

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.892 align:middle line:84%
live according to their practice
that they can do right then

00:35:44.892 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and there and
shouldn't sit waiting

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:90%
for something to happen.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right now.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.648 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
he likes to say.

00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And in another sense,
there's a few stray theories

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.855 align:middle line:84%
that actually
Shambhala's already here

00:35:54.855 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and is a matter of
turning your awareness.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.205 align:middle line:84%
And then you just don't even
notice all these morons running

00:36:00.205 --> 00:36:01.330 align:middle line:90%
around shooting each other.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, essentially, what
happens is, your spirit does,

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself cooking
through some last edges

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.010 align:middle line:90%
of resistance.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself becoming so
present in this very moment.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:90%
You're so inside of your body.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:84%
You're so dealing with
the edges of resistance

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:84%
that you might be
feeling somewhere

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.050 align:middle line:90%
in your energy system.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:10%
And by surrendering
deeply into it,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:10%
by going into it as
opposed to skipping out

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and avoiding it in some
way, by going right

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:10%
through the core of
your last resistances,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:10%
it's like suddenly you
feel all of your energy

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:10%
almost like releasing
and expanding.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And my experiences often have
been through the third eye

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.130 align:middle line:84%
where there's like last areas
of resistance and the energy

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:90%
is just--

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, it kind of like
it burns through there.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly,
there's an expansion.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that,
oh my god, more of me

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
is outside of my body
than is in my body.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Yet you are simultaneously
in your body.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
peculiar sensation

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:84%
of being in a place
of singularity

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:90%
where there are no boundaries.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And I did my first three-day
intensive Buddhist retreat

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:90%
where you sit.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:84%
We had all these people, like
20 or 30 people, in our house.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And my dad led this retreat.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And you sat cross-legged, back
straight, one hour at a time,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:84%
five-minute break, one hour
at a time, five-minute break.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the day,
you're meditating 12 hours.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've climbed mountains.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I have skied down
55-degree slopes.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.750 align:middle line:90%
I've jumped off 30-foot cliffs.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:90%
I planted trees for 22 years.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
there's nothing harder

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:84%
than sitting in this posture,
cross-legged with the hands

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.400 align:middle line:84%
folded and the legs
crossed, back straight,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
not leaning against the wall,
sitting, for 12 hours a day.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only physically
challenging to hold

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that posture for so
many hours a day,

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's mentally
challenging just

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to stare into my
mind, and my thoughts,

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and my emotions all day long
with no distractions, no TV,

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
no phones, very little
food, and just doing that.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we did
this for three days.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.470 align:middle line:84%
On the second day of the
retreat, my legs were shaking.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even sit properly.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my legs were bent
upwards, and I was shaking.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.710 align:middle line:90%
My eyes and my back was hurting.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:59.260 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, after
hours of boredom and just

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.330 align:middle line:10%
staring at this opaque
nothingness, and the breath,

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:10%
and watching the breath,
and doing this technique

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.740 align:middle line:10%
called Insight Meditation,
all of a sudden, in my belly,

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:10%
right down in here, there was
this just cracking explosion

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.630 align:middle line:10%
of ecstasy.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It was so bright.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It happened so fast.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just are bursting
out laughing hysterically.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.487 align:middle line:84%
And I would fight
it and try to stop

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:84%
laughing because there were all
these people in the meditation

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:27.820 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, I
started laughing so hard.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I just had to leave.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I had to get up and go outside.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked outside,
it was like I didn't even

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:90%
have a body anymore.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had the arms and
the legs, and I could walk.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But I was in this
ethereal space.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking through
this grassy field in the park

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.300 align:middle line:90%
in Vancouver, Canada.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I came upon these
three weeping willow trees

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.000 align:middle line:90%
with them blowing in the wind.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And when the wind blew through
the trees, I was the tree.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I was the wind
caressing the tree.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I could feel it just
like I can feel my face

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:90%
and my eyes and my skin.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:90%
I could actually feel it.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I was in this extended
consciousness.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, there was
this supernatural ecstasy

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.319 align:middle line:90%
bathing the trees.

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And it just seemed to get
deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I got so lost in these trees.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember these
birds, these crows,

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:90%
walking on the grass.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And it tickled me when
they walked in the grass

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.930 align:middle line:90%
because they were walking on me.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like I was
connected to the whole.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden--

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:84%
this vast consciousness, this
beautiful, peaceful ecstasy.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:84%
It was not like an
exhilarating kind of a high.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:90%
It was this smooth ecstasy.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
I could hear what

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
the Hindus call
"the sound of OM,"

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the all-pervading
sound of the universe.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I could hear every plant, every
tree, every blade of grass.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Every unique plant
had its own sound.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And the sound was very
silent but very obvious

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:90%
in this consciousness.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sounds
of all living things

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
were blending into this
symphony of the sound of OM.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:90%
And I looked up.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking up and
looking up at the sun.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And I was just in awe.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh my
god, I can hear the sun.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.560 align:middle line:84%
The sun was making this very
high-pitched frequency sound

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:84%
combined with a very
low-frequency sound together.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was also in
the symphony of OM.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And the sound of
everything was merging.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And I walked.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And it just felt like I was
made of pure consciousness.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.424 align:middle line:90%
I was no longer the body.

BC, Pythagoras taught that

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
a harmonic sound was
produced from the motion

of the celestial bodies.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The sun, the planets, and
the stars in the heavens

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
were producing a sort of cosmic
music as they pulse from within

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:10.452 align:middle line:84%
and travel along the vibrating
strings of their orbits.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras actually
experienced going

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:84%
beyond his physical boundaries
with his consciousness

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and hearing what is now called
"the music of the spheres."

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.960 align:middle line:84%
He believed anyone who purified
their senses could have

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.640 align:middle line:84%
this experience, quote, "Such
a one will perceive things

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.340 align:middle line:84%
invisible to others
and will hear

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:90%
things inaudible by others."

With this enlightenment
and wisdom,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras gave birth
to classical music

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and the intervallic system
we use to write music today.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:84%
He saw three phases of music;
the musica humana, the music

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.590 align:middle line:84%
of a human being as
the human instrument;

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.920 align:middle line:84%
the music
instrumentalis, the music

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:84%
of the voice and
musical instruments;

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and the musica mundana,
the music of the cosmos.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.100 align:middle line:84%
The human musical body
and mind is an instrument

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.710 align:middle line:84%
which if tuned
and purified could

thought I was
seeing the bubbles.

And they were beautiful.

00:45:23.519 --> 00:45:25.940 align:middle line:10%
They were soap-bubbles-like.

I kept thinking, well,
somebody's saving me,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.880 align:middle line:90%
that I'm being saved.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:90%

I could see on top of me, left
of me, and the right of me.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I realized
I couldn't see my body.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see my body.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.220 align:middle line:90%
There was no body.

I was a bubble.

00:46:10.617 --> 00:46:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I must have been a bubble.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:90%
I was a spirit.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.722 align:middle line:84%
I was moving with these
bubbles, and I was a light.

00:46:18.722 --> 00:46:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And these lights
were like diamonds.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:84%
All sides, there were a
kaleidoscope of colors,

down, time stopped.

and there was no end.

And the now had a voice.

of voices.

And then it sang.

And I was singing.

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:51.615 align:middle line:10%
But it was very much I opened
up in so many ways to the point

00:57:51.615 --> 00:57:56.670 align:middle line:10%
to where I began to feel like
I was in a different space.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience, towards
the end of the Sufi breathing,

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.770 align:middle line:90%
I was about 45 minutes out.

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a vision that
I became an eagle

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and that I was
flying into the sun.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could literally
feel the rays

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.460 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, the yellow rays
of the sun, impacting my body.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was flying along.

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
wind under my wings.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.980 align:middle line:90%
It was really different.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea I'd
ever expect anything

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.820 align:middle line:84%
like this or experience
anything like this.

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.180 align:middle line:90%
But it was really, really good.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And then after we did the
Sufi breathing exercise,

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.320 align:middle line:84%
then I was tested
on the GDV machine.

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And it showed a completely
different result.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.430 align:middle line:84%
My chakras had
become more in line.

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.980 align:middle line:84%
They became larger,
especially my heart chakra.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that the heart chakra
circle became very, very large

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.520 align:middle line:84%
on the computer
as we viewed that.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Krishna Madappa took
several readings of each

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.140 align:middle line:84%
of the five participants' energy
centers and their total aura

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.190 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:58:56.190 --> 00:59:01.110 align:middle line:10%
>> We are also going to get a
baseline reading of the water

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:05.760 align:middle line:10%
in a simple principle as we
have done with the electrophoton

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.290 align:middle line:10%
capture device.

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:10.740 align:middle line:10%
And we will do
this in principle,

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.620 align:middle line:10%
taking 15 frames per second
for a total of 10 seconds.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So we will take 150
frames five times.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Before and then after
the Sufi meditation,

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.870 align:middle line:84%
we will again look
at a similar set.

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And all this will be dynamical
images off the water.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:33.180 align:middle line:84%
At which point in time, once
we open it up in the program

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.430 align:middle line:84%
called the Scientific
Laboratory program,

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:41.130 align:middle line:84%
then we can see clearly
influence how the water's area,

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:45.390 align:middle line:84%
entropy, fractality,
intensity all has

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:48.420 align:middle line:90%
contributed before and after.

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.360 align:middle line:10%
>> I met Anandamayi Ma
when I was very young.

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I was away from
her for a long, long time.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:58.440 align:middle line:10%
And then I saw her again
when she was a little older.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- she was completely
merged with everything.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:10.710 align:middle line:90%
She was-- how can I?

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's words can't
describe who she was,

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.172 align:middle line:90%
who she is.

01:00:17.172 --> 01:00:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Mukti, that's her.

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not her baseline.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> This is Mukti Ma
after Sufi breathing.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:22.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:23.196 align:middle line:90%
>> And you can--

01:00:23.196 --> 01:00:24.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at her heart chakra.

01:00:24.362 --> 01:00:24.754 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:25.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:25.554 --> 01:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You can on one
hand, for Mukti Ma,

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
it is really strong when
she is in active mode, which

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.931 align:middle line:90%
is why you also relish dancing.

01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.754 align:middle line:90%
>> The African dance.

01:00:38.754 --> 01:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
The dynamical mode for
you is very pleasant.

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> He then took several
readings of the water's energy.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.690 align:middle line:10%
Amazing results ensued.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.900 align:middle line:10%
The average energy
coherency, structure,

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.040 align:middle line:10%
and organization of the
water improved by 20%

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.240 align:middle line:10%
in just one hour of meditation,
registering from a baseline

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.510 align:middle line:10%
of 10 and progressing to 8.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
In the second meditation, the
group chanted the word "OM"

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.070 align:middle line:90%
for 30 minutes.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
This meditation is
designed to bring harmony

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.300 align:middle line:90%
to the human body and mind.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%
After this meditation,
Krishna again

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.030 align:middle line:84%
took several readings
of everyone's auras

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.066 align:middle line:90%
and the water's energy.

01:01:22.066 --> 01:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me know
when you're ready.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What will happen now, we must
make sure that while we have

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Nuala's nose there and--

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Recovery.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, look, look, look.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> The nose.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Now we can just do her tail.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.706 align:middle line:10%
>> Her tail.

01:01:33.706 --> 01:01:34.834 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, one more time then.

01:01:34.834 --> 01:01:35.634 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:01:35.634 --> 01:01:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> He's got the tail though.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Out of my--

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, give me the scarf.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:43.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Nuala is like--

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:48.710 align:middle line:10%
>> This was a study to
show is it possible to send

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:55.620 align:middle line:10%
and quantify, measure energy
of healing, loving energy to--

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.210 align:middle line:10%
sending.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:02.930 align:middle line:10%
So if we sent loving energy
to another being who is not

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:08.070 align:middle line:10%
directly in front of you
but in another space,

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:09.890 align:middle line:10%
will they receive it?

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:13.230 align:middle line:10%
And if they receive
it, how does it show?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That was the purpose.

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And this was done with a team
of researchers in Slovenia.

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we see that you've
got the person who is sending

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:31.610 align:middle line:90%
energy.

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the right side,
this sending of energy.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And on this side is the
receiving of energy.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.860 align:middle line:10%
So from the right side,
when you talk about,

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.310 align:middle line:10%
because the emotional heart is
on the right, it is sending.

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:44.675 align:middle line:10%
So there is a little burst.

01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:46.450 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, these
bursts I captured.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's separate
from the body.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.280 align:middle line:10%
It's leaving.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.140 align:middle line:10%
This burst is leaving the body.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:51.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Indeed.

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, that's amazing.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.840 align:middle line:10%
>> And the receiver
is receiving it.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.005 align:middle line:10%
And look at the
shape of that too.

01:02:59.005 --> 01:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> How far away are they
physically from each other

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.610 align:middle line:90%
during the experiment?

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Two buildings.

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Two buildings?

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Two buildings.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So this burst of energy
traveled two buildings and went

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.060 align:middle line:10%
to--

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>> This person, who
was the receiver.

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.585 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is documented
scientifically as biophoton

01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:17.385 align:middle line:10%
emissions.

01:03:17.385 --> 01:03:18.616 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, yes.

01:03:18.616 --> 01:03:21.997 align:middle line:90%


01:03:21.997 --> 01:03:25.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Honey, you got big chakras.

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:28.479 align:middle line:84%
>> You got some big
chakras over there.

01:03:28.479 --> 01:03:29.946 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:29.946 --> 01:03:32.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at the size
of those things.

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:34.325 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:34.325 --> 01:03:35.325 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a new way to--

01:03:35.325 --> 01:03:36.792 align:middle line:90%
I like your chakras.

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:43.149 align:middle line:90%


01:03:43.149 --> 01:03:44.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:03:44.616 --> 01:03:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> They are huge.

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at her blue.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.605 align:middle line:84%
Let me just zoom in on her
blues, her inner eye chakra.

01:03:50.605 --> 01:03:51.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at that.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking
up the whole head.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That one's after what?

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is after OM.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, she even told me this.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The gentle meditations
have a more--

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.189 align:middle line:84%
but your inner eye chakra,
your third chakra and her crown

01:04:03.189 --> 01:04:03.989 align:middle line:90%
are very--

01:04:03.989 --> 01:04:04.927 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:04:04.927 --> 01:04:06.334 align:middle line:90%
>> And her throat.

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at the strength that
has gained from here up.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> In the OM.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> In the OM.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And you had a vision.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You said--

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:17.599 align:middle line:90%
>> She did?

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:18.598 align:middle line:90%
That's where the tears--

01:04:18.598 --> 01:04:21.706 align:middle line:84%
>> --going out and
opening into the clouds.

01:04:21.706 --> 01:04:22.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:04:22.506 --> 01:04:26.640 align:middle line:10%
I had this amazing
vision in my third eye,

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:31.100 align:middle line:10%
which I felt both there
and above my head, a very

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.750 align:middle line:10%
powerful energy.

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:36.710 align:middle line:10%
And it was quite a unique
experience I have never

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.730 align:middle line:10%
experienced before.

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:40.370 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
It was really exciting when
I was able to actually see it

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
on the aura machine that my
chakras that I could feel

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
were the most activated
showed on the machine as well.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was also
very emotional,

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't help but cry.

And my heart chakra all the
way through to my crown chakra

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
was very enlarged
through that experience.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:13.910 align:middle line:90%


01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The average energy coherency
structure and organization

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
of the water had
maintained a level of 8.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
The third meditation was a
two-hour Sidhi meditation.

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Each meditator
pursued their own form

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:31.190 align:middle line:90%
of insight or Sidhi meditation.

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
difficult practice.

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Near the end, I mean, my
body was in so much pain.

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:38.270 align:middle line:90%
My legs hurt so bad.

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to just move.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But something allowed me
just to relax even further

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
into the pain rather
than trying to escape it.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I got to this point
where I opened my eyes,

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and the sunlight coming
through the windows

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:54.740 align:middle line:90%
and just gracing the walls.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I saw and I felt it
in my heart that God

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.090 align:middle line:90%
was in the sunlight itself.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.824 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- God
wasn't-- you know,

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't this spiritual
light in the room.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.870 align:middle line:90%
There was just sunlight.

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But the sunlight, I was so aware
that the sunlight touched me

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.280 align:middle line:90%
so deeply.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I was moved to the most
incredible emotions in my heart

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And tears and goosebumps
came for hours afterward just

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in waves.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.170 align:middle line:10%
It was such a deep
experience to see

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:24.710 align:middle line:10%
God was in the sunlight itself.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:28.210 align:middle line:90%

a dynamical image of photons

from a baseline of 10 to 5.5,

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
which means it went nearly half
way to its total potential.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:20.220 align:middle line:90%
This was astounding.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
David Sereda explains.

my consciousness,

that our consciousness
as a group,

that we affected
a glass of water,

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and we transform its energy, its
coherency, and its structure,

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and we cause it to progress
halfway to its total

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
potential-- its
total potential--

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
1 being the highest
value, 10 being

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the lowest, 1 being the closest
we can get to absolute oneness,

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.170 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:50.990 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it?

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
How did our brains and
our state of consciousness

01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:57.777 align:middle line:90%
cause the water to transform?

01:07:57.777 --> 01:07:58.860 align:middle line:90%
How did it actually occur?

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, if we look at the
idea that we are not

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.300 align:middle line:10%
just a particle, an
organism, that we

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.500 align:middle line:10%
have this aura, this energy
field, as this field extends

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.210 align:middle line:10%
beyond the physical
boundaries, it's

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:14.952 align:middle line:10%
exchanging information
with everything around it.

01:08:14.952 --> 01:08:17.410 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I don't believe this
is just occurring with water.

01:08:17.410 --> 01:08:23.189 align:middle line:10%
Water is the easiest to see
how consciousness is affecting

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:26.943 align:middle line:10%
reality because the hydrogen
and the oxygen atoms in H2O

01:08:26.943 --> 01:08:28.484 align:middle line:10%
are actually the
simplest structures,

01:08:28.484 --> 01:08:30.600 align:middle line:10%
and then they're the easiest
to see these effects.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
We're probably affecting
the wood, the wall,

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.899 align:middle line:84%
in fact, each other,
the planet even,

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and even beyond the planet.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We're affecting everything
with our consciousness.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine for a moment
if a hurricane was coming

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.279 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.746 align:middle line:10%
But now, as people,
instead of what

01:08:47.746 --> 01:08:49.620 align:middle line:10%
we're doing with the
weather forecasts, which

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.990 align:middle line:10%
is we're amplifying
the fear and looking

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:54.850 align:middle line:10%
at all the blowing of the winds
and all the torment and so on,

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:59.279 align:middle line:10%
imagine instead we had
millions or billions

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:06.270 align:middle line:10%
of people simultaneously engaged
in an organized, synchronized,

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:11.550 align:middle line:10%
guided imagery over the media
sending loving intentions

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:14.430 align:middle line:10%
and calming
intentions to a storm

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:18.270 align:middle line:10%
or even with redirecting
it to a safer environment.

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Would we find that the
storm has diminished?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.689 align:middle line:84%
Would we find that the
storm might be moved?

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll never discover it
unless we look for it.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
If we don't ask the questions
and we don't try it,

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.470 align:middle line:84%
we'll never know whether
it matters or not.

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:35.439 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is, how is
this actually occurring?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.660 align:middle line:10%
We have to look at quantum
modeling of the atom

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.680 align:middle line:10%
and smaller to see the answer.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And the answer,
as we look at it,

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.229 align:middle line:10%
was first discovered
by a physicist named

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:52.000 align:middle line:10%
Walter Schempp, who in the 1990s
found that atoms all around us,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.060 align:middle line:10%
in our bodies, and in the
air mass, in the space,

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:58.800 align:middle line:10%
are actually exchanging
information with each other,

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.000 align:middle line:10%
having a dialogue.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.521 align:middle line:84%
So the key is how is this
information propagated

01:10:03.521 --> 01:10:04.770 align:middle line:90%
through the space-time medium?

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:06.060 align:middle line:90%
How is this occurring?

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Atoms are talking to each other
and exchanging information

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:10.840 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And the way that it
actually works is like this.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the diameter of
an electron spinning around

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
in the proton in
a hydrogen atom,

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
what physicists discovered
is electrons jump shells

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.060 align:middle line:90%
or wavelengths.

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They change wavelengths, which
means they change diameter.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
What Niels Bohr discovered
is that when electrons

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
jump into shorter diameters,
they go into a higher frequency

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.080 align:middle line:90%
orbit.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they do that,
the atom radiates off

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
some of its energy in
the form of a light wave,

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.900 align:middle line:90%
in the form of electromagnetism.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when electrons go
back to a longer wavelength,

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.310 align:middle line:84%
they jump back out to
a greater diameter,

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
the atom is actually
receiving electromagnetism.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And this has been known
since the early 1900s.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
What Walter Schempp discovers
in this process of sending out

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
energy in the form
of electromagnetism

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and receiving energy in the
form of electromagnetism,

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that these transmissions and
receptions were not blank,

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
meaning he discovered they had
intelligent information encoded

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.360 align:middle line:84%
in them, which means that
just like we talk on the radio

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and we tag the human voice
onto a radio wave which travels

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.900 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light,
and that we send pictures

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and voices on microwaves which
travel at the speed of light,

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
which is television,
that the atom was doing

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
the same thing,
that atoms that live

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in this giant, enormous
universal field

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, these
atoms are actually

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
talking to each other
on a regular basis.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, what
Schempp discovered, and he

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
proved this scientifically, is
that when the atom is sending

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.540 align:middle line:84%
out a light wave, it has
information and data actually

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.670 align:middle line:90%
tagged onto the light wave.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
receives a light wave,

01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
it actually is receiving
not just a light wave

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
but actual information and data
is recorded on the light wave.

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> While Walter Schempp's
intelligent atom shows how

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
communication can happen in
less than a second over a small

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
sphere of distance,
such as the Earth,

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and within minutes
inside the solar system,

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
it cannot explain how
communication between two

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
points can happen
instantaneously regardless

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.020 align:middle line:84%
of distance in the universe,
such as between galaxies

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.300 align:middle line:90%
millions of light years apart.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But Einstein's discovery of
spooky action at a distance

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:33.980 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates how consciousness
can travel between two points

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.590 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
This identifies a field
that is able to send

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%
conscious information
not only faster

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.510 align:middle line:84%
than light but instantaneously
over any distance.

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was spooked by it
because no theory in physics

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.360 align:middle line:90%
could explain it, not even his.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But they could verify that
it was actually happening.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Two ideas are entangled
when they have a shared space

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and become part of
a system together,

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
most frequently described in
an atomic scale as, let's say,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.335 align:middle line:84%
two electrons in
near the same space.

01:13:15.335 --> 01:13:17.306 align:middle line:90%
They can't be exactly the same.

01:13:17.306 --> 01:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So one way they're
different is to have

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
what people refer to as spin,
one opposite to the other.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
That allows them
to share the space.

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And this shared system
is called entangled.

01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:37.200 align:middle line:10%
These two items, element,
which could be two people,

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.460 align:middle line:10%
are entangled with each
other if they share qualities

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.220 align:middle line:10%
of the universe in their space.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you fall in
love with somebody,

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:49.200 align:middle line:84%
you are entangled
with that person.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
If you belong to a group that
gets together and has deep,

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
stimulating discussion, you
become entangled in such a way

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
that all of you share
some aspect of the others.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
In any case, this
kind of entanglement,

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
even though we haven't
been able to demonstrate it

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in strong terms in macroscopic
cases like two people,

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:20.280 align:middle line:84%
it's real, demonstrable, and
a function of atomic systems.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're gradually moving
toward demonstrating

01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
in laboratory experiments that
it can happen at larger scale

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.990 align:middle line:90%
systems.

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem there
should be any limit on that.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So people undoubtedly can be
entangled with each other.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.360 align:middle line:10%
>> When scientists took
a mother and baby rabbit,

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.270 align:middle line:10%
separating them over
a great distance,

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.870 align:middle line:10%
they hooked both their brains
up to EEGs and atomic clocks

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:50.570 align:middle line:10%
to measure the event.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:52.830 align:middle line:10%
They pinpricked the baby
rabbit, and the mother

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:55.130 align:middle line:10%
felt it instantaneously--

01:14:55.130 --> 01:15:01.320 align:middle line:10%
not at the speed of light, which
is 186,282 miles per second,

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.170 align:middle line:10%
but they felt it
instantaneously.

01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.360 align:middle line:10%
When Alain Aspect,
the French physicist,

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.520 align:middle line:10%
did the same experiment
by separating

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.340 align:middle line:10%
electron, anti-electron
pairs over great distances,

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:15.390 align:middle line:10%
he found when stimulating
the properties of one

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:18.300 align:middle line:10%
of the pairs, the other
over a great distance

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.730 align:middle line:10%
would respond instantaneously.

01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
What conscious
field is there that

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
is beyond light-speed
communication and observation?

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> My friend Dean
Radin, for example,

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
believed that entanglement
is not just for atoms,

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that we can have entanglement at
bigger scales and, ultimately,

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
at macroscopic scales and
suggests that when we are

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
communicating in what appears
to be an impossible way,

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
using telepathy or some kind
of a psychic connection,

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that that can be described
and maybe accurately using

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.840 align:middle line:90%
the terms of entanglement.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I truly, 100% believe
that everyone is psychic.

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:09.510 align:middle line:10%
I think that some people have
a easier time bringing out

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:12.450 align:middle line:10%
their abilities once
they know the techniques

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:14.370 align:middle line:10%
and how to control them.

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:17.390 align:middle line:10%
And really, more
so than a matter

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.920 align:middle line:10%
of having the ability because,
again, we all have it,

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.580 align:middle line:10%
it's more a matter of are
people disciplined enough

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.650 align:middle line:10%
to practice the techniques?

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Are they courageous enough
to see what is coming,

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and to let themselves
see the information,

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.740 align:middle line:90%
and then to communicate it?

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I think some people are better
suited to reading people.

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "reading,"
I mean picking up

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
information about
anything from their past

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to present to a little
bit of their future.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that some people are
better suited to reading people

01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
whereas other psychics are
better suited to picking up

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.510 align:middle line:84%
information about, say,
remote locations or lost

01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
objects or world events.

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just like any other skill.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people, say,
with musical talent

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.810 align:middle line:90%
are good at reading music.

01:17:10.810 --> 01:17:13.912 align:middle line:84%
Others are good at
improvising and then getting

01:17:13.912 --> 01:17:15.370 align:middle line:84%
into the different
styles of music.

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
with your psychic abilities.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Another comparison
here is that anybody

01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:24.790 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to at least
bang out some notes on a piano.

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there's, obviously,
prodigies from the time

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:29.410 align:middle line:90%
that they're born.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the same thing
with your psychic abilities.

01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just blown away
that, both with myself,

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that I could have lived
to almost the age of 29,

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's people who die,
millions of people who die,

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
without ever really realizing
the extent of their abilities.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's just so
important that, for one, we

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.050 align:middle line:84%
get over this idea that there
is only a few gifted people

01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:58.000 align:middle line:90%
out there with these abilities.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.140 align:middle line:90%
That's completely not true.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Most people have them.

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:07.600 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the amazing features
of entanglement and probably

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.300 align:middle line:10%
one of the reasons that
it's so hard for many people

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:15.580 align:middle line:10%
to comprehend or believe in is
that it really goes all the way

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.320 align:middle line:10%
down or all the way back.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So in a strong
sense, the Big Bang,

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
if that's the way
the universe started,

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:25.240 align:middle line:90%
was an entangled state.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of whatever developed
after that still is entangled.

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:36.925 align:middle line:84%
This implies even if it's
not true in complete detail,

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the model suggests that we are
entangled with each other even

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.980 align:middle line:90%
at huge distances.

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Coming down to
earth, so to speak,

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it means
without much question

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that there is some, a little
bit of entanglement present

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
in the relationships of
everybody on the planet.

01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So it shouldn't
be very surprising

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
when we discover that a
big event in the world,

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
like the tragedy of 9/11,
causes very, very large numbers

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
of people to think about
the same kind of thing,

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.800 align:middle line:84%
increase their
entanglement, and result

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.350 align:middle line:84%
in a measure on our
random event system,

01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't talked
about in detail yet,

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:24.760 align:middle line:90%

God, the overall
consciousness of the universe,

through the universe.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.408 align:middle line:84%
So everything's coming
in all directions.

01:22:45.408 --> 01:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It's all crisscrossing
all at the same time.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you are in
a tiny little spot,

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
if you had spherical
consciousness

01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
or spherical
vision, you could be

01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
seeing the light
coming from here,

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.436 align:middle line:84%
and the light coming from here,
and the light coming here,

01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and light coming-- and
all of it's crisscrossing.

01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is all of
that's going on all the time.

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And none of it's
getting distorted.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, photons literally
can cross one another.

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And they may summate
or they may cancel.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
We call it cancel out.

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
They appear to
summate or cancel.

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But after they've
crossed each other,

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
they go on as if
nothing had happened.

01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And if that wasn't the case,
when we looked up at the sky

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
at night, we would see mush
because all the photons

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
would be interacting with
all the other photons.

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would be just creating
a complex, quote, "mess."

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So instead, the universe
appears to be designed

01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have all
this information from all

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:40.880 align:middle line:84%
these directions constantly
mixing in every part of space

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, and none
of it gets mixed up.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about that power,

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
forgetting about
how that happens,

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
let's just say that
it does happen.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why you and I can
look up at the sky at night.

01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And our little
pupils are this big.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.505 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing this
gigantic vastness.

01:23:57.505 --> 01:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
All that star information
is going into your pupil.

01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It's going into my pupil.

01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:02.840 align:middle line:90%
It's going on simultaneously.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So all that holistic
information is simultaneously

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.960 align:middle line:90%
present in every single spot.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We take that idea,
which is a fact.

01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Forgetting about how
it works, it works.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do
is you combine one

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.550 align:middle line:90%
with the idea of a system.

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And a system is two or more
things that are connected.

01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're sending feedback,
circulating information

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and energy back and forth.

01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:27.707 align:middle line:84%
And through the interaction,
the parts come together.

01:24:27.707 --> 01:24:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And the whole becomes,
quote, "greater

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:30.414 align:middle line:90%
than the sum of its parts."

01:24:30.414 --> 01:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen and oxygen
come together.

01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:32.710 align:middle line:90%
They're two gases.

01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:34.280 align:middle line:90%
They send, have feedback.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
They circulate energy
and information.

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We've got a liquid
called water which

01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
has all the unique
properties of waterness.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Now what's common among
every system, whether it's

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
an electron and a
proton in an atom,

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's two
molecules coming together,

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's two strands
of DNA, or two cells,

01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
be it in the heart or the brain,
or two people, or two planets,

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
or two gal-- it doesn't matter.

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
If the components are sharing
information and energy

01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's circulating,
then what happens

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a storage
process that takes place.

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And this storage process
is also an evolving one.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
The take-home message,
the way that this first

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.490 align:middle line:84%
came to me when I was a
professor at Yale many years

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:27.920 align:middle line:84%
ago, is what goes around and
stays around evolves around.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Information, it
doesn't all disappear.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it preserved,
but it can potentially

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
grow because it
can be influenced

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.050 align:middle line:90%
by the other things around it.

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Once you recognize
that idea, then you

01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:40.364 align:middle line:84%
realize that not only does
everything at every level

01:25:40.364 --> 01:25:41.280 align:middle line:90%
have, quote, "memory."

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called the systemic memory.

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But this memory is in a
state of constant evolution.

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a prerequisite for
learning itself is feedback.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And we know that's the case.

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know in daily
life if we want to learn,

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.230 align:middle line:84%
for example, to shoot
a basket or learn

01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to play a musical
instrument, we have

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.890 align:middle line:84%
to get feedback about whether
we're making the right notes

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're getting
the baskets in the ball.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
The feedback is what provides
us with a corrective process.

01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It's called negative feedback
or positive feedback.

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out that feedback
operates at every level,

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:17.740 align:middle line:84%
from the tiniest micro level to
the most gigantic macro level

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and every level in between.

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So you take the infinite nature
of the storage of information

01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum of
space with photons,

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and now you add systems
operating the feedback loops

01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:30.000 align:middle line:90%
at every single level.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you realize what

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.280 align:middle line:84%
we call the neural network
of our brain, which

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.100 align:middle line:84%
makes our brain's
capability for processing

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.490 align:middle line:90%
all this information.

01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now that each
of our individual brains

01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
are part of a much
bigger brain, which

01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:44.540 align:middle line:90%
happens to be on the Earth.

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is part of
a planetary brain, which

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
becomes part of a solar system
brain, that then becomes

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.830 align:middle line:90%
part of a galactic brain.

01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
brain here is a network

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.300 align:middle line:90%
of circulating feedback loops.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Then what you realize
is at every level

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.650 align:middle line:84%
you get this process of
assimilation of ever more

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:05.306 align:middle line:90%
complex information.

01:27:05.306 --> 01:27:09.326 align:middle line:84%
And if that boggles the
mind, well, too bad.

01:27:09.326 --> 01:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
We just have to expand our
mind to be able to see this.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>> In '84, so it's interesting
to see that we have both

01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:20.550 align:middle line:10%
Democrat and Republican
presidents involved

01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:23.580 align:middle line:10%
in different aspects of this
Department of Peace movement

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:26.490 align:middle line:10%
that would actually be a
US Department of Peace.

01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So actually, this
current bill that's

01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
in Congress right
now, HR 808, was

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
written and first introduced
by Congressman Dennis Kucinich

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
from Ohio in July 11, 2001,
which, to me, is very important

01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to remember the date because
it was exactly two months

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.270 align:middle line:90%
before 9/11.

01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And the legislation was
written as a proactive,

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:50.550 align:middle line:84%
solution-oriented
new department,

01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:53.250 align:middle line:84%
tiny new department, that
would be at the table, sitting

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
at the table, with
the president and all

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the different department
heads to actually

01:27:59.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
be another tool
for the president

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to decide if we have
no other options,

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps we would
have to go to war.

01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we did have other
options, a lot of those options

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.070 align:middle line:84%
would come from the
secretary of peace.

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And so congressman Kucinich
introduced this bill

01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:15.384 align:middle line:90%
in July of 2001.

01:28:15.384 --> 01:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I heard about it
in the newspaper.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I wrote him a fan letter.

01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dear Congressman
Kucinich, thank you

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.510 align:middle line:84%
for introducing
this legislation,

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:26.580 align:middle line:90%
which is incredible legislation.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We were a country at
peace, July 11, 2001.

01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:32.807 align:middle line:84%
We were fairly peaceful
around the world.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, you and
I are both from Cleveland.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.120 align:middle line:90%
We're both raised Catholic.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:36.930 align:middle line:90%
We're both short.

01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:39.232 align:middle line:84%
And we're both vegetarian,
and although he's vegan.

01:28:39.232 --> 01:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said, we have
a lot in common.

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:41.571 align:middle line:90%
We both love peace.

01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote me
back a very nice letter

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.030 align:middle line:90%
thanking me for my interest.

01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it wasn't until
Marianne Williamson, who is now

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:53.850 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine, had an
email list in March of 2003,

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
so about a year
and a half later.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.900 align:middle line:10%
Marianne invited
anybody that would

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.310 align:middle line:10%
like to go to
Washington to learn

01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:01.560 align:middle line:10%
about this Department
of Peace legislation,

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.060 align:middle line:10%
to learn how to
go into our Senate

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:06.150 align:middle line:10%
and congressional offices
on the Hill in Washington,

01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:09.180 align:middle line:10%
and to have intelligent
conversations with our elected

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:13.220 align:middle line:10%
representatives about
creating a sister department,

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.900 align:middle line:10%
a new department, which would
be this Department of Peace.

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:18.240 align:middle line:10%
And so I went to Washington.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.316 align:middle line:84%
There were six of us from
Arizona-- joined 200 people.

01:29:21.316 --> 01:29:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So that was four years ago.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was the United
States working

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.710 align:middle line:84%
on creating a
Department of Peace.

01:29:25.710 --> 01:29:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And now here we are four
years later in May of 2007

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.630 align:middle line:84%
with 28 countries
now around the world
