his outcomes were
incorrect, this

00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%

Which led to the food
pyramid, a recommendation

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%

the federal government has

It's built around
five food groups.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:84%
At its base are foods

that should be eaten
in greatest quantity.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%

be eaten sparingly,

fats, oils, and sugar,

at the food pyramid and if you

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
try to make a, say, a
food plan for a child,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
if you get rid of saturated
fat from protein foods,

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
like meat and cheese and
eggs, you've gotten rid of all

the caloric needs of the child.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's only one place to
go to fill those caloric needs,

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%

If you're feeding a ton

it's only going to send the
blood sugar skyrocketing.

OK, if you have type 1 or
your kids have type 1--

everybody knows
that blood sugars

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:10%

The patient asks the doctor,
aren't the complications

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:90%
caused by high blood sugars?

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
What foods cause
high blood sugars?

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Carbohydrate.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Then what should I eat?

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Carbohydrate.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:90%

Yet the overall
medical community

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:90%
is telling me the opposite.

>> Lactose intolerant
people don't drink milk.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%

eat that many carbs.

came in, she said,

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:10%
he can have orange juice
and he can have pancakes.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:84%

And I didn't have that
previous knowledge,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
so if I would have left the
hospital with that information,

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I would have felt so much more
ready to take on this disease.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, I met
my endocrinologist.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:84%
She was going over
how to count carbs

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and dose my insulin
appropriately.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And everything was about carbs
and insulin, carbs and insulin.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, do you want me
to just not eat those carbs?

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no, it
won't do you any good,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:90%
and you need those carbs.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And both those
statements couldn't

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:90%
be any more untrue, I know now.

there is no such thing

00:26:32.555 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Just whatever the standard diet
is that you've been giving her,

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:90%
just keep giving her that.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing is learning

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:90%
how to control it with insulin.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we were
in the hospital,

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember them saying, eat
whatever you want and dose

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And actually, his first
meal in the hospital

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:90%
was a breakfast burrito.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.672 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like, that's
eggs, that's no carbs,

00:26:49.672 --> 00:26:51.255 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have to
dose you for that.

00:26:51.255 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:90%
But then he wanted two cookies.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.288 align:middle line:84%
And after every meal,
he had two cookies.

00:26:54.288 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And we left the hospital
with him being over 300--

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:90%
still.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> My entire nursing career,
this is how we've done it.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:10%
I knew that my patients at my
job ate whatever they wanted,

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:10%
and we just gave them
the sliding scale.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I knew that their
numbers were 200 and 300.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:90%
I knew that that was the norm.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:90%

Most doctors and most

You can't get a patent on it.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:84%

talking about nutrition.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can't make any

[RINGING]

>> The governing bodies put
these recommendations out,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and it forces physicians to
live within those guidelines

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
for fear of reprisal.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a dual prong where
not only do the doctors never

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%

blood sugars,

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%

you're giving your child that
puts them at the most risk.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The only reason a child
has a low blood sugar

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:84%

carb counter and you weigh food

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:84%

fact that the label itself

You didn't know what your
blood sugar level was.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, it was
either very low or very high.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And my low blood sugars
were a constant problem

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:90%
for the family.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And it happened that I was
working for a company that made

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:90%
clinical laboratory equipment.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.390 align:middle line:10%
And I saw an ad for
a three pound device

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.970 align:middle line:10%
that could be used
in emergency rooms

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:10%
to distinguish
unconscious drunks

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:10%
from unconscious diabetics
by the blood sugars.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, if I knew
my blood sugars--

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm an engineer.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.270 align:middle line:84%
If I knew my blood sugars, I
could do something about them.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So I ordered a meter and started
measuring my blood sugars.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:84%
In the early days, I had
a very creative lunch.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Peanut butter, mayo, and
tuna on date nut bread.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I found that the highest
blood sugars were after lunch.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, if lunch
is the biggest culprit,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:84%
it must be because
the carbohydrate.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
eliminate the bread

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate the peanut
butter, and I'll just

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.270 align:middle line:84%
have the tuna fish
and mayo and a salad.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Whammo.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:84%
The amount of insulin I took
for lunch dropped dramatically,

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and the blood sugars after
lunch became predictable.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I decided at that point that I
had to get this information out

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and that the doctors
would bend over backwards.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I did
was approach my own doctor,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:84%
who was president of the
American Diabetes Association.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, people come to me
once a month for a blood sugar.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.380 align:middle line:84%
If they can measure
it themselves,

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd have no patients.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:90%
No one would come to see me.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:90%

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.515 align:middle line:84%

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I would
go to medical school

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to get an MDF to my
name and therefore

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:90%
be able to get published.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:84%

life expectancy for a type 1
