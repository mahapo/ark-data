00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.496 align:middle line:90%
>> It is inevitable--

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:12.340 align:middle line:90%
a fact, a certainty.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.848 align:middle line:90%
All of us are born to die.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:90%
But what then?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:84%
From our earliest
beginnings, human beings

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
have yearned to know
what lies beyond death.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
More than 2,000 years ago, Plato
wrote that all earthly wisdom

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is but a rehearsal for a great
awakening, an awakening that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:90%
takes place upon death.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Every religion and culture
share one commonality, belief

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:90%
there is life after death.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Today, the subject
of life after death

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
is a common topic of discussion
among physicians and scientists

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Scientific proof is sought,
and modern techniques

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:84%
are being used to research a
subject that was once taboo.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It took one man to discover
that there was a common thread

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:90%
in near-death experiences.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It was he who broke new ground
by studying the cases of those

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:84%
who were diagnosed clinically
dead and then returned to life.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%
This man is Raymond Moody.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
He is a classically trained
PhD in philosophy with an MD In

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:90%
psychiatry.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody's first
book, "Life After Life"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
paved the pathway for
near-death studies.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, Dr. Moody's
findings have become

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
part of the language of
the academic, medical,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual communities.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It was he who coined the
phrases "life after life,"

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.980 align:middle line:84%
"near-death experiences,"
and "light at the end

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:90%
of the tunnel."

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I did not start life as a
particularly religious person.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, what I
like to say about my background

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
is that we were not religious
and called it Presbyterian.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
My approach to life was
trying to figure out things

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:90%
by the scientific method.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And in that context,
of course, I

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
had always assumed
that death is just

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
an obliteration
of consciousness.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.247 align:middle line:84%
It's like the lights going
off, only permanently.

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I started hearing
about all of this stuff

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
about quote "a
life after death,"

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
my reaction, essentially,
was, give me a break.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this was people
fooling themselves and engaging

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:84%
in wish fulfillment,
and that sort of thing.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:10%
In 1965, when I
was 21 years old,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:10%
I was an undergraduate
student of philosophy

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Virginia.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of my philosophies
professors, John Marshall,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
told me about a
psychiatry professor

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
there at the University,
Dr. George Ritchie,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
who had had a quite
amazing experience when

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
he had been pronounced
dead some years before.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And since up to that
point, I had always

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
assumed that at that point where
the doctor declares you dead,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:90%
there's no more consciousness.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I was highly intrigued
that here was

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
a person who was quite
sane and reputable, very

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
beloved in the
community, and so on,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
who had had quite a different
experience, that when he was

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
pronounced dead,
in fact, had very

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:90%
vivid states of consciousness.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when you hear one
thing like that out of a void

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that's so contrary to
what you have always

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
assumed on instinct, for
the rest of your life

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
you just don't know
what to make of it.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
In 1969, after I'd gotten my PhD
in philosophy, I was teaching.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And one day, one of
my students came up

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
after class and quite
unsolicited said,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody, I wish we
could talk more about life

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.140 align:middle line:84%
after death in this
philosophy class.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I remember him kind
of emphasizing that word

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
philosophy as
though I was somehow

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
amiss in not talking
about what he

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
regarded as an important issue.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I thought
that was just an antique notion.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
asking him, well, why

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
do you want to talk about that,
as though that's something

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that a modern philosophical
perspective would not really

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:90%
be interested in.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
about a year ago, I

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
was in a bad accident and
my doctor said I died.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience that
has totally changed my life,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't had anybody
to talk about it with.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, I
wanted to hear this,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:90%
so I invited him into my office.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And to my absolute
astonishment--

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I remember to this day
how surprised I was--

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
he told me
identically what I had

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
heard from George Ritchie
four years before.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I
heard that story,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
this was something

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that had to be fairly common,
because it was obviously

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
an impossible coincidence
that I would have stumbled

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
across the only two cases of
this that existed over a four

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
year period without even
attempting to find cases of it.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment, as I
said, I realized, hey,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
is worth looking into

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and that there will
be more of this.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I particularly
wanted to find out

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
why scholars hadn't
written about this

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and why I, who had
spent, up to that time,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
my whole life studying
the human mind,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.055 align:middle line:90%
had not ever heard of this.

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went
to medical school,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
of course, that was a great
opportunity to go to the codes

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
after the patients had had
cardiac arrest that I would

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
hear about, and I would
go and sit with them

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and talk with them, and the
patients would, in fact, tell

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:90%
you the same kind of story.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Again and again, the
same kinds of events

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that I first heard from George
Ritchie many years before.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
That was how I wrote
"Life After life."

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a great deal of
spiritual inspiration

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
in talking with people
who have returned

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
from the verge of
death, and to see

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
how their lives have been so
positively transformed often

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:90%
by these experiences.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
George Ritchie once said to me,
quote "Raymond, this experience

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
makes your humanity
even more of a burden."

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Up until this point, Raymond
Moody's work had drawn him

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
almost exclusively to those
individuals who had experienced

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:90%
a close encounter with death.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But now his focus shifted
to a second group,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
those whom death had separated
from a loved one, the bereaved

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and the grief-stricken.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Once again, his curiosity was
triggered by an experience

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
that many of them shared.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We have known for a long
time in medicine that a high

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
percentage of people
who are bereaved,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
who've lost someone
to death, will,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
within a certain period
of time of the death,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
have an experience which they
regard as seeing and being

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of the
departed loved one.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, there
are several separate medical

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
studies that have been
conducted independently

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
that suggest that as
many as 2/3 of widows

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.860 align:middle line:84%
will have the experience
of seeing or hearing

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
from their husbands after
the husbands have died.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
But we know from clinical
observation that this is true

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
of other bereaved people as
well-- bereaved siblings,

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
bereaved parents,
bereaved children,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
bereaved friends
of the deceased--

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and that this is a remarkably
common human experience.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The mere fact that, as we
know from the medical studies

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
these experiences are
remarkably common,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
means that we human
beings are highly

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
predisposed to
experiences like that.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Well then, why can't
we at least try

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
to conceptualize a way of
bringing circumstances together

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in such a way as to increase
the likelihood that a given

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.835 align:middle line:84%
individual will have that
experience at a given time

00:09:16.835 --> 00:09:17.635 align:middle line:90%
and place?

00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In search of an answer to
this tantalizing question, Dr.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Moody returned once more to
his studies of philosophy,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
in particular, the writings
of the ancient Greeks.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
He vaguely recalled an
account by the Greek historian

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus about a technique for
communicating with the dead.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>> I had read something in
Herodotus about a place that

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:10%
the Greeks had where, allegedly,
one would travel to see

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.815 align:middle line:10%
one's relatives and friends.

00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I went to the archeological
reports that I could find

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and I discovered that, in
fact, this place had actually

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:90%
been located in 1957.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:10%
The site had been rediscovered
by an archeologist.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:10%
I had a very interesting
exchange with him

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:10%
over a period of
a couple of days,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:10%
discussing with him his
original excavations

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:10%
and his work at this
certainly phenomenal site.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:10%
Not just for the dead, all the
men...everyone could make it

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:10%
to see on the
surface of the water.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Visions, exactly.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Doctor [? Daccarus ?] in
his search for this site,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
surmised that, in fact, the
Oracle was in the Northwest

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:90%
corner of Greece in Epirus.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Homer talks about the Oracle
being located at a point

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
where two rivers flowed together
to form the Acheron river

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and that there was
a pinnacle of rock.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
All Dr. [? Daccarus ?]
did was to trust Homer

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:10%
and to go to the location that
he believed Homer was talking

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:10%
about, excavated
and, indeed, did

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:10%
find this subterranean
complex there exactly

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:10%
at the location where he
surmised Homer had located it.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:10%
The institution
was subterranean.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
This was another factor know
why it was so long undiscovered,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:90%
even in its heyday.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In antiquity, it was
entirely underground.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
In approximately
160 BC, the Romans

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
burned the Oracle of the
dead, and at this point,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
it dropped out of Western
civilization as we know it.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Then subsequently, in about
350 AD, the church banned it.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
They made it anathema
for a Christian

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to believe that a spirit
can be seen in a mirror.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And so for that reason, we have
had no continuing tradition

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
of education of the deceased
in Western civilization.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Dr. [? Daccarus ?]
observed, even prior

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to his discovery of the
Oracle sign in 1957,

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that it was a folk belief
among the local inhabitants

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that the entrance to the
other side was nearby.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's astounding
that this tradition

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
persisted in the
folklore of the region

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:90%
for literally many centuries.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Plato has been my favorite
philosopher since 1962,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and I've always loved the
ancient Greek culture.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it was just a
really overwhelming experience

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go there
and to walk around

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
some of these places that I
had read about for the better

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
part of my life, and
to be able actually

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to go to this institution,
the Necromontium,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
as it's called in the
locality, and stand

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:84%
on those places that
Herodotus wrote about,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and that I believe Homer
described so beautifully,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.092 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely thrilling.

00:13:36.092 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We're here at one of the most
amazing places in the world,

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:90%
to me, at least.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the Oracle of the
dead at Ephyra, where,

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times, people would
come to actually see and visit

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits of their
departed loved ones.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Until recent times,
scholars have

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:84%
assumed that what
was going on here

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
was simple fraud, in the sense
that we, in the 20th century

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:84%
West, presumably know that such
things that were described here

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient writers can't be.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But in light of
recent developments

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and research that's
been done now

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
by many psychologists
replicating

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:84%
the experience of seeing
apparitions of the departed,

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we can now have a
plausible explanation

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on in this
rather amazing sanctuary.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And now, we come through this
entrance way of enormous stones

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:84%
into a courtyard,
which is laid out

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
to give the impression
that one is in a cave,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
or in an underground world.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to imagine
that, in antiquity, this

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
was roofed over, so that we
literally felt as though we

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:90%
were in the underworld.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
At this point,
the Pilgrims would

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
have been met by the
psychagogues, the guides who

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:84%
lived here to conduct the
pilgrims through the experience

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:90%
of visiting with their deceased.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
As we go in a little bit
into the more functioning

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
part of the Oracle proper, we
find immediately in front of us

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
here a wall.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The right part of the wall
was a medieval addition.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The Byzantine church built a
chapel here in medieval times

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.435 align:middle line:84%
on the ruins of
the ancient Oracle.

00:15:53.435 --> 00:16:03.854 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.854 --> 00:16:08.195 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are in the
operative part of the Oracle.

00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:84%
A sharp right turn at
the end of the corridor

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
brings one into a maze,
with narrow passage ways,

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
sharp turns.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.545 align:middle line:84%
And it's good to remember that
all of this was in pitch black.

00:16:24.545 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the visitor
came to the last turn

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of the maze, passed through
it into the apparition chamber

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
proper through
these heavy doors.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And as the apparition
seeker came into this room,

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:84%
one can only imagine what was
going through his or her mind

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:84%
because this was the
culmination of the journey.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
The pilgrim walked
across, walked into,

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
the apparition area proper.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then here, the seeker
underwent the culmination

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
of his journey.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
In this room, there was
a big bronze caldron.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was probably highly
polished and filled with water

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to make, in effect,
a big mirror.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The pilgrims would encircle
it, gaze into the caldron,

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and there, in the
reflective surface,

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
initially see images,
which, in many cases,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
no doubt would then
appear to emerge

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
from the reflective
surface, come out, actually,

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:90%
into the physical environment.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Full color, full-size,
three dimensional.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And no doubt, in
many of the cases,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
talking, so that
the seeker would

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
experience the living presence
of the person who had died.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite convinced
from my own experiments

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in the United States that
after the seeker would leave

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
this room, he was totally a
different person from then

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
on for the rest of
his life, dramatically

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
changed by what
happened to him in here.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And finally, after this
experience in the apparition

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
hall, the pilgrims were led
here into this chamber, which

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
was a purification room,
where they were purified

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:84%
by bathing in sulfur, which was
the ancient way of purifying

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
anyone who had been in
contact with the dead.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Then after the sulfur bath,
they were led out of here,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
down the hill to the
river, the river Acheron,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:84%
where they received
a ritual bath.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
This time, I come back here, I
feel a little more confident.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, now
we do know what was

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
going on here, at
least the outline,

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and that we can now
demonstrate psychologically

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that it is, in fact, quite
possible to have visitations

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
with the deceased exactly
as the ancients believed,

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:58.053 align:middle line:84%
and contrary to the opinion of
two millennia now of scholars.

00:19:58.053 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I often reflect that if
history had been a little bit

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
different, if we had taken up
the great tradition of evoking

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.910 align:middle line:84%
apparitions just as we did
in the tradition of democracy

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of history,
our notion of science, so many

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of the institutions that
way value in the West,

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
we might have had a very,
very different culture indeed.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:35.447 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> But the practice of evoking
apparitions through clear depth

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:90%
gazing did not vanish entirely.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Rather, it went underground.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It became a favored
tool of mystics

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:90%
and metaphysical scholars.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The most famous of them was
a 16th century Frenchman

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:90%
known as Nostradamus.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
He used a crystal ball to
assist him in predictions.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus had a
contemporary in England

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:90%
whose name was Doctor John Dee.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>> He was an inveterate scholar,
and by the time that he was 19

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:10%
years old, he was already
an instructor in Greek

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:10%
at Cambridge University.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:84%
He became an expert
in mathematics.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
He wrote one of the standard
textbooks of mathematics

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Elizabethan age.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
He helped reintroduce
Euclid to Europe

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:90%
by writing a very good preface.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
He was an expert in navigational
equipment and techniques,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and he invented some of the
navigational apparatus which

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
made the great voyages
of discovery possible.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
At some point in his career,
he came across an Aztec,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:90%
an obsidian divination mirror.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Obsidian is that black,
glassy volcanic rock

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:90%
such as is found in Mexico.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And when the Spaniards
went to the new world,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
they brought one of these
objects back for study.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Aztec priests
would gaze into this

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and try to figure out what was
going to happen in the future.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
As John Dee experimented
with this object,

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
he was surprised to see that
he was able to have visions.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
He describes how spirits would
appear at first in the mirror

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and then come out of the mirror
into the room, that would

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:90%
carry on audible conversations.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>> John Dee may have also
applied obsidian stone gazing

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:90%
to more political ends.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
He's reputed to have been one
of Queen Elizabeth's spies

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
who kept her informed of the
activities of her arch enemy

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Spain.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It is known that the code
he used to sign his messages

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to her royal majesty was 007.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Clear depth, or
mirror gazing also

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
persisted in a more pervasive,
but less threatening, form

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
through popular culture.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It features prominently in
fairy tales and legends.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
In the Grimm Brothers
"Snow White,"

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:84%
the wicked queen continually
turns to her mirror,

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:90%
mirror on the wall.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The original story
of "Aladdin" tells us

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the genie appeared not from
the lamp, but reflected in it.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.170 align:middle line:84%
19th century writer
Lewis Carroll

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
gave us the unforgettable
Alice in Wonderland

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:90%
in "Through the Looking Glass."

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Early 20th century
Halloween cards

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
frequently show mirrors
reflecting ghosts, goblins,

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and strawhaired sweethearts.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And the advertisers of
the era knew a good thing

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:90%
when they saw it.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
They offered a future filled
with a brand new sewing

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:84%
machine, and the trend continues
right up to the present.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:10%
In the Disney blockbuster
"The Lion King,"

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:10%
a young Simba gazes into a pool
and hears words of assurance

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:10%
from his dead father.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But while myths and the
movies can rely on magic,

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Moody needed
something more concrete.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:10%
He was searching now
for a practical way

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.990 align:middle line:10%
to encourage
apparitional experiences.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And he turned once more to
the Greek oracles of the dead.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's quite surprising,
but nonetheless true,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that there were lots of oracles
of the dead in antiquity,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and apparently they
operated in different ways.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:90%
They had different methods.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And the ones in which the
apparition of the departed

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
was actually made to appear,
and the visitors would actually

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:84%
see the apparition
of the departed,

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:90%
were called psychomanteums.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I created my
own psychomanteum.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The way I did it was
that I mounted a wall

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
mirror in an upstairs room
in my research facility.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Mounted it so that the
bottom edge of the mirror

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:84%
was about 32 inches
off the floor,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
surrounded the entire
area of the mirror

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
with a black velvet curtain
to exclude reflections.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Put a very comfortable
easy chair right

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in front of the mirror,
took the legs of the chair

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
off so that sits low
down to the floor,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and so that the person sitting
in the chair looking up

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
into the mirror does not see
his or her own reflection.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Behind the chair there
is a dim light bulb

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
mounted so that it casts
a diffuse illumination up

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:90%
over the back of the chair.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And when all the
lights are turned down

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and the only illumination is
coming from this light bulb

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:90%
behind the chair.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
That provides a
really spectacular

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:90%
optical clear depth.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We ask each subject to choose
some one person who's died

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:90%
that they want to see again.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And I get them to
choose mementos,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
things that the deceased person
on which they very poignantly

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
associate with the
life of that person.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
out to my facility,

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and typically, we take a
walk through the country.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, I
really explore with them

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
at a very deep level, why
do you want to do this?

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:84%
What is your motivation
for doing this?

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.058 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:26:31.058 --> 00:26:34.590 align:middle line:84%
We have a very
extended encounter,

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
during which I really get
down with these people

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and get them to tell them
all about the relationship

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.152 align:middle line:84%
that they had had with
the departed person.

00:26:43.152 --> 00:26:44.985 align:middle line:84%
I want to know everything
about this person,

00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:46.906 align:middle line:84%
like what kind of
person was this?

00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:90%
What was their personality like?

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:84%
What are your good
memories of this person?

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
What are you not so good
memories of this person?

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.244 align:middle line:90%
How did they die?

00:26:59.244 --> 00:27:01.529 align:middle line:90%
How did you react to the death?

00:27:01.529 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:84%
What do you miss
most about them?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Really, a very
intense exploration

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.724 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship
that they had

00:27:08.724 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
had with the deceased person.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Then I get them to
show me the mementos

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.235 align:middle line:84%
that they have
brought, and I get

00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
them to tell me the significance
of each one of these mementos.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
When they've reached
this point of almost

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
like a saturation of talking
about the deceased individual,

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
we lead them into the
apparition chamber proper.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I put them in there, let
them sit in the chair,

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and tell them that they are to
just relax in there, and gaze

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
far, far away into the mirror,
and sit there, and sort of

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
review some of the things
that we've talked about--

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
to sit there expectantly,
waiting, in effect,

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
for the apparition of the
departed person to appear,

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
which, in a surprisingly
high percentage of cases,

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:90%
it actually does.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, our subjects
will report typically

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.505 align:middle line:84%
at first seeing a
cloud or a mist,

00:28:17.505 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:84%
like the mirror fogs
over, as it were.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And then this mist
dissipates, and then

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
the apparition of
the departed person

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
may appear, at first often in
the distance in the mirror,

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and then the apparition
of the departed person

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
seems to emerge from
the mirrored surface

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and come out right in
front of the subject.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:84%
They often see it full color,
full size, three dimensions,

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
apparently quite solid,
sitting right across from them.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> They were coming from the
mirror to being in the room

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.260 align:middle line:90%
or past me.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.817 align:middle line:84%
I would say within about
one to two seconds--

00:29:06.817 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:90%
would take to do each one.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:90%
So it was fairly rapid--

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:90%
this kind of a pacing.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Dianne brought me
in, and she told me, you know,

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.900 align:middle line:84%
what to expect, and she
said I'll be back to get you

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
in about half an
hour, 45 minutes.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.466 align:middle line:84%
And when she came
and opened the door,

00:29:21.466 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like she
had just walked out,

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:90%
like it was only a few minutes.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Really didn't seem like
a long time at all.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I sat for 40 straight
minutes and watched one figure,

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:84%
full color, three
dimensional to a point,

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
but not lifelike in the sense
that I couldn't ever have

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:90%
a sense of seeing through it.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It had that sense of airiness
to that, but not vague.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the ghostly
kind of figure

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.300 align:middle line:90%
that you normally see portrayed.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:84%
They were very visible
and very clear.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I was gazing into the
mirror and totally relaxed.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I didn't
really see anything,

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and then I was getting
images of light.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any,
you know, face.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell any
face to anything,

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.120 align:middle line:90%
but what I saw first--

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:90%
what you would--

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was like a
goldish green type of light,

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.115 align:middle line:90%
and it was just floating.

00:30:34.115 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> A number of our subjects also
report the experience of going

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:90%
into the mirror themselves.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
They feel at a certain
point that they go,

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:84%
just like Alice did in
"Through the Looking Glass,"

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:90%
in effect, into the mirror.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this unusual
alternate dimension

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that they meet up with their
departed relatives, who

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
seem to be there again
right in front of them

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.568 align:middle line:90%
very vividly and communicating.

00:31:05.568 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first sat
in there for a while,

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if anything
was going to come up.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I never got the real clouds
or anything like that.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I just started to
see pieces of images.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably not going to
remember any order, because it

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:90%
started out very slow at first.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And as things progressed,
things started

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:84%
coming up more and more, and
my eyes did continue to tear,

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:90%
like I said to you.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.306 align:middle line:84%
Had happened before,
but it was funny.

00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:43.930 align:middle line:84%
With that chair
sitting back like this,

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I could just let it run
down, and I was fine.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I saw Laura.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like the night--

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, I started
to cry just because I

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
wanted it so bad, but I
didn't know why I was crying,

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I calmed down
again, and I said, well,

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:90%
let me close my eyes again.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And I did, and that was it.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- you know, I thought
I might have smelled something,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:84%
but then I couldn't
distinguish what it really was.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't anything
familiar, and that was it.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I ever even conducted
a single person through this

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:84%
procedure, I went and asked a
very dear friend of mine, Dr.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.670 align:middle line:84%
William [? Roald, ?] who has
studied spontaneous apparitions

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:84%
of the departed for
over 40 years, whether,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
to his knowledge, there had
ever been a single case in which

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
harm had come to anyone from
an apparitional encounter.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And Bill said to me, absolutely
not, but that not only that.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Typically these experiences are
very beneficial because they

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
enable people to smooth over the
rough edges in a relationship

00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and to perhaps get their grief
resolved a bit so that they

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:90%
can go on with their lives.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And nonetheless, I
do caution people.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this alone.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:84%
This can be very, very
powerful material.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I've often been
asked, was I scared?

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And certainly fear
came up on occasion,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
as I saw things like
wolves and things

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.436 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the mirror.

00:33:29.436 --> 00:33:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what was going
to come out of the mirror,

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and could it possibly hurt me?

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Those fears came and went
because of my belief system.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no question in
the minds of subjects who go

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:84%
through this that they are in
a waking state of awareness

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.920 align:middle line:84%
at the time and that they
experience [INAUDIBLE] that

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:84%
kind of surrealistic flavor
that we have in dreams,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that the perception
seems absolutely real,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
that they have the sense of
the presence of the person,

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:14.960 align:middle line:90%
that they seem palpably there.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.429 align:middle line:84%
15% of our subjects report
being hugged or touched

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.449 align:middle line:84%
and actually having tactile
experience of the event,

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
seems incredibly real.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:84%
One has the impression
in going through it

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that it is a real contact and
a real experience of seeing

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:90%
a departed loved one.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What did it for me was I got
a pat on the top of the head.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And I turned around to see--

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.239 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:52.763 align:middle line:84%
because I had stretched back
a little bit, and I got a pat,

00:34:52.763 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:84%
and I turned around,
and I thought maybe

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I hit the ceiling or something
because the ceiling slopes.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:90%
But I put my hand up.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.443 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even reach
it with my head,

00:35:00.443 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and I said, well, that was real.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.284 align:middle line:90%
You know, I felt it.

00:35:06.284 --> 00:35:10.117 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if that
was my son's way of--

00:35:10.117 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:84%
he likes to kid
around, and he knows I

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:84%
like my hair in
proper place maybe.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I
definitely did feel something.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I had the definite sensation
that somebody came in from

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:84%
behind the mirror around to
my left side and was just kind

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.530 align:middle line:84%
of being there, and I wasn't
quite sure who it was or, you

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.760 align:middle line:84%
know, if it was my
grandmother or not,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:84%
but a little while after
that I heard a cat meow,

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.790 align:middle line:90%
and she really loved cats.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So I felt that that
was the connection

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:90%
that she had been there.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:90%
It was intuitive.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I was asking the
question internally,

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really know
how I got the answer.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of jelled
mentally for me.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing about
the psychomanteum--

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
lot of different ways

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:84%
to receive information,
a lot of people

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.360 align:middle line:90%
experience information visually.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I've had oral or hearing
type of information.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I've smelled different
smells or scents, as well as

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:84%
just intuitively
received information.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It can be a very
visionary experience.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I am the first to add--
and immediately want to go

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.240 align:middle line:90%
on to add here--

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that the fact that
people report it as real

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:84%
does not mean in a scientific
context that it was real,

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:84%
but the importance of the
fact that it's experienced

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:84%
as a real event from the
scientific perspective

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
is that this means that we
have, in fact, recreated

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
seeing apparitions,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that this gives us a good
theoretical model, as it were,

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
for the experience of
seeing apparitions,

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:84%
because that's exactly what
people who see apparitions

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:84%
of departed loved
ones spontaneously

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
will tell us--
that they interpret

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it to be a real encounter
or a real event.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm still somewhat skeptical.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt there
is something going on.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt that this is
energy from someplace else.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.819 align:middle line:84%
It may someday turn out to
under-- come to the realization

00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's some sort of
energy that it comes

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.050 align:middle line:84%
not from the plane where
people are deceased and not

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:35.070 align:middle line:84%
here, from some other
plane, but without a doubt,

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:84%
it does not come from what
we think of as being reality.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact that
the experiences I've had--

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
particularly my
parade of images--

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.960 align:middle line:90%
was not faked.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It was not.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.974 align:middle line:90%
It was extremely real.

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
could have happened.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
could have been faked.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:90%
I was truly taken aback.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:84%
This was the experience
that I was looking

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.370 align:middle line:84%
for to tell me this
phenomenon was like no other

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that I'd ever had,
and I needed that,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:84%
because although my experiences
on most people's point of view

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:90%
would have been--

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.795 align:middle line:90%
meditation and et cetera--

00:38:19.795 --> 00:38:22.170 align:middle line:84%
would have been pretty profound,
it wasn't profound to me

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.780 align:middle line:84%
because I've had
them so many times.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
This was the experience
that I've been looking for

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to say no, no, no.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Something's different here.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
This is not your normal
everyday experience.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:90%
This is exceptional.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So I was just, to use a very
clinical word, blown away.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I was, as I said, just--

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I was looking around in the
room, looking at these figures

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
as they hovered over me and
passed by me, and saying,

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
this is happening.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.800 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So to say the least, I
was pretty taken aback.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was very happy,
very joyful, relaxing.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It does calm you.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:90%
It does have a--

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I was very nervous going in.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:13.680 align:middle line:90%
You knew that, you know?

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to expect.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And it does kind
of calm you, and I

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:84%
can't get over that I was
in there for that long.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I really can't get past that.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like
five minutes and like

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I had this whole long time
to wait, and it was over,

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.130 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I wrote reunions because I
wanted to get this information

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that whatever one
makes of these findings

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:84%
about the apparitions
seen in a psychomanteum

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:90%
is important work.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And for me, of course, the main
response I want to see happen

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
is my colleagues in
psychology and so on--

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to see them
reproducing this phenomenon

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:90%
and seeing what they make of it.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's already happened.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:84%
To my knowledge, so far
nine other psychologists

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.670 align:middle line:90%
have fully replicated this.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.910 align:middle line:84%
One of these
individuals is a woman

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:17.830 align:middle line:84%
who works in Houston at a
very well known hospice there.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.730 align:middle line:84%
She's been a hospice counselor
dealing with the terminally ill

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and their families now for
a long, long time-- very

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:90%
well-respected in the community.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And she's using
this for therapy,

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to help people, you
know, face death

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and to face the
losses that they've

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.790 align:middle line:90%
gone through in their lives.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>> In helping people walk
through the grief process

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that there
is life after death--

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.230 align:middle line:84%
it's tremendously
healing for them.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Actually, in my work,
I've never worked

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:10%
with a dying patient
who did not have

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:10%
an apparitional experience.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's 100%.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:90%
You can write this in stone.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
If a person is terminally
ill, when it's close to death,

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.460 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have an
apparitional experience.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one thing
that we do in hospice--

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.290 align:middle line:84%
if a person has had an
apparitional experience

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.750 align:middle line:84%
or if they've had a
reunion, that person becomes

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:84%
top priority,
because we know death

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.150 align:middle line:84%
is imminent, that it's always
within one week or two weeks

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.400 align:middle line:90%
that a person is going to die.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.920 align:middle line:84%
No matter-- if we think
maybe they've got six months,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:84%
we're not real sure if hospice
even ought to take them in,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.200 align:middle line:84%
but once a person has that
apparitional experience,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:84%
if they have a
terminal illness, we

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:84%
know that person is greeting
them, they're loving them,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.896 align:middle line:84%
and they're escorting
them to the other side.

00:41:33.896 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And then people in
bereavement groups--

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a high number
who also have a reunion.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So when-- I was very
familiar with this.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It was like a common
everyday occurrence,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and hearing Dr. Moody
speak for the first time,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I was on the edge of my seat.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, how could he do this
under controlled circumstances?

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.214 align:middle line:84%
It was just incredible
to me, the thought

00:41:52.214 --> 00:41:53.130 align:middle line:90%
that he could do that.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:84%
62 people have been through
the oracle in Houston.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Out of the 62, 48 have had some
type of reunion experience.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And actually I call mine oracle,
because oracle means a place

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:90%
for acquiring wisdom.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that, even
when a person comes and has

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:19.620 align:middle line:84%
a session, even if they do
not have a reunion, something

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:90%
very profound--

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
a deep psychological--
and deep psychic change

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.042 align:middle line:90%
takes place for them.

00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, it's such an
intriguing idea that,

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient world, there was
an institution for 1,000 years

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
where you could go, and there
you could have the experience

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:84%
of seeing, and visiting with,
and talking with departed

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:90%
relatives.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be too surprised
if, over the next few years,

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:59.750 align:middle line:84%
this institution reappears
in our modern world.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:05.285 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so looking forward to
seeing that as it develops,

00:43:05.285 --> 00:43:08.015 align:middle line:84%
to see how people respond
to this, to see how

00:43:08.015 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:90%
our society integrates this.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
My hope for it is
that it will turn out

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.460 align:middle line:84%
to be something
very therapeutic,

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and that it will help
people who are undergoing

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:84%
prolonged grief, who just
can't let go of a loved

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.423 align:middle line:84%
one lost to death, and for
that reason are miserable

00:43:27.423 --> 00:43:30.141 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
most common things

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that we hear people
say at that time

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is, if I only had
five more minutes.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:84%
What we can do now,
without a doubt,

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:84%
is that we can give people
that five more minutes.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:54.620 align:middle line:84%
If we can help people like
this turn themselves around

00:43:54.620 --> 00:44:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and open up to hope and to a new
life, then I think all of this

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.047 align:middle line:90%
will be justified.

00:44:03.047 --> 00:45:03.446 align:middle line:90%
