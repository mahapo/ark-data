is Bibliotheca Philosophica

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:10%
Hermetica, the Library
of Hermetic Philosophy.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
This library, with the
rare books and manuscripts,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:90%
altogether, some 23,000 volumes.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The possibilities that I
had to buy books was always

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
combined with the task to
produce every day a result

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:90%
as an entrepreneur.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:90%
So I built a company.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I made out of the
profits of my company.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
But it is not so that the books
come like birds into the house

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:90%
of treasures of Mr. Ritman.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, you have to make an
effort to acquire them.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:90%
I built a library.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I bought books.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I brought them together.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:10%
The books that are
on the shelves,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:10%
you have to open the
information suddenly.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
You come to the point
that you are not

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.776 align:middle line:90%
standing alone any longer.

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
fantastic point what I

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
call, the chain of [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:10%
We are invited to be members.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I love
most in this library.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
To see that in every single
book in a different way.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And a book doesn't stand alone.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:90%
They stand together.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
They are like in a continuous
conversation with each other.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's what fascinates me.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>> By Western esotericism,
we mean a set of currents

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:10%
of movements, of authors, that
can go back basically to Late

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:10%
Antiquity and then to the
Middle Ages with a big revival

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:10%
in the early modern period
during the Renaissance.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And then which continue
during the Enlightenment

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and also throughout the
19th and 20th century.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Basically up to our days.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Western esotericism is
the study from the outside

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to the inner reality.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
You can call that
occult streams,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
you can call that
esoteric streams.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You can call that
hermetic streams.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It is like to dive into
all the different aspects

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:90%
of a tradition.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Traditions that emerged
and developed mostly in Europe

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:90%
and in the Mediterranean basin.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To compose an alphabet
of understanding.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But it never gives the meaning
of the language itself.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Approaching the
divine, approaching kind

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:10%
of metaphysical reality,
are precisely what we can

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:10%
understand as the
core of esotericism.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very interested
in the human presence.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But not as the end of the story,
but the beginning of the story

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:90%
where I said, what is the man?

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.232 align:middle line:90%
Why is he here?

00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
He comes from the invisible, he
lives here, and he disappears.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
If you look through
the Hubble telescope

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
you can see this
infinite universe.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And you see all different forms
of energy that are, in a way,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:90%
on the move.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we did not know but
we are experiencing a Big Bang

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:90%
We say you have the elements--

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But I believe, for myself,
that there's a new element

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
A new element in the atmosphere
that was invisible and came

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to mystery schools and under the
protection of ceremonies where

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
there is a holy of holiness.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:84%
There this divine energy
was kept as a secret.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that divine
energy is now

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.125 align:middle line:84%
available to billions
and millions of persons.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
so-called individualism.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Why if that doesn't refer any
longer, not a second longer,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
with the old tradition,
with the old generation,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:84%
with the way you think,
you live, you are?

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:10%
The domination of
the past is broken.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.065 align:middle line:90%
It all ends in anarchy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And that you see in this moment.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The international
power feuds, conflicts,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:90%
that we are in a crisis.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can say, I have
nothing to do with that.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:90%
It comes closer and closer.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:90%
We are not independent.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
We are very dependent, more and
more dependent, to each other,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:90%
as we thought in the past.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We have main
collecting areas.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:10%
And they are Hermetica, Alchemy,
Mysticism and Rosicrucianism.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But related collecting areas
are Kabbalah but also theosophy,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
anthroposophy, so the more
modern movements originating

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
from the 19th century
can also be found here.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Esotericism is in
fact a modern word.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it was created
in the 19th century.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the history
of the term is older.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:90%
The word comes from the Greek.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greek
esoterikos, which

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is an objective, which
basically means "interior."

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It means something
that is inner.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So something that is
inside, as opposed

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to something that is outside.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:10%
And in ancient Greece the
term was used especially

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:10%
to refer to philosophy,
to philosophical schools.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:10%
For instance, in
the case of Plato,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:10%
in the case of
Aristotle, the idea

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:10%
was that there was a
particular teaching that

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:10%
was meant for a broader public.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.895 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a more
restrictive kind of teaching.

00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And that teaching
would be reserved only

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:90%
for a particular elite.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.398 align:middle line:84%
So you really needed
to be a pupil.

00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Hermes Trismegistus.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:90%
That's called filius noster.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And here you see the Sun,
the Moon and coming together,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
it brings forward
Hermes Trismegistus.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
He's having can you
say this, and it

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol of initiate.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.046 align:middle line:84%
The [INAUDIBLE],, the cloak,
an attribute of power.

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
The text of Hermes Trismegistus
are written down already

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
in the pyramids of
Sakkara in Egypt.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We have an exhibition
on Hermes Trismegistus And

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:10%
the visual imagery
connected with Hermes,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:10%
a very colorful exhibition that
shows you the roots of Hermes

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:10%
Trismegistus.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:90%
He is part Egyptian, part Greek.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
He is the Egyptian god
Thoth and the Greek Hermes.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:10%
And these two combined
were Hermes Trismegistus.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:10%
This is a beautiful image
of Hermes Trismegistus.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:10%
It's a reproduction
from a mosaic in Sienna.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
He is a wisdom teacher, a sage
who presents to the Egyptians

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:90%
the laws and the letters.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Originally the
distinction, perhaps,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
did not have much to
do with spirituality.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Later on this idea was
connected to the ancient mystery

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
cults like [INAUDIBLE] or
the Mysteries of Eleusis.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And therefore a more
spiritual meaning

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:10%
was attached to the word.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:10%
And it was thought that in
fact, an esoteric teaching

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:10%
had to do with something
that was religious, something

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:10%
that was spiritual.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So it had to do, for instance,
with the destiny of man

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:90%
after death.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
That is basically the
origin of the modern concept

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
of esotericism.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one of the most
important books in our library,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
a book by Hermes Trismegistus,
the name giver of the library

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Hermes.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And we collect all the editions
of his philosophical works.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We call it now the
Corpus Hermeticum.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
In the older days it
was called Pimandre,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
after the pupil that is
instructed by the philosopher

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Hermes.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The Egyptian god Thoth,
and the Greek Hermes,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
they are both
scribes, messengers.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And magic is also attributed
to the two of them.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:10%
And that is why they
were conflated and became

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:10%
Hermes Trismegistus,
the thrice greatest.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Classical culture becomes
less prominent during

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:90%
the Middle Ages.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.165 align:middle line:10%
Greek culture was
sort of forgotten.

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But then it comes back
in the Renaissance.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the treasures of
the library is the Corpus

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticum of Hermes
Trismegistus, on vellum.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.866 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:10%
>> At the end of
the Middle Ages,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:10%
with the conquest
of Constantinople,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:10%
there is the rediscovery of
the Neoplatonic texts and texts

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:10%
by Plato, so the rediscovery
of Platonic philosophy.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But also the rediscovery
of the hermetic texts,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
which played really a
key role in the revival

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of what we call esoteric
ideas, especially in Italy.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:10%
In Florence, more particularly,
with Cosimo de Medici and then

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:10%
Lorenzo Magnifico of
course, with scholars

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:10%
such as Marsilio Ficino,
Piccola de la Mirandola.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:10%
It all starts in Italy but then
it's spread all around Europe.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in the Medici
library in Florence.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was built
by Michelangelo.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:10%
And there was an exhibition
to commemorate the 500

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:10%
years since the death
of Marsilio Ficino.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:10%
The director of
the Medici library,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:10%
she said to me, Mr. Ritman,
I have a present for you.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:90%
But can't take it away.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:90%
She gave me in my hands.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was the original copy
of the manuscript of the Corpus

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Hermeticum.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:10%
Cosimo de Medici gave an
order to Marsilio Ficino

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:10%
to translate the text of
the Corpus Hermeticum.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:90%
And then it was printed.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And you see it there in
an original publication

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:90%
on parchment.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also a very,
very interesting story.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
When we did an exhibition
on the text and tradition

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Corpus Hermeticum,
we had a Dutch translation

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
in manuscript of the
Corpus Hermeticum.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But one half of the
book was missing.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
In that period I
still lived at home.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
evening, something

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.165 align:middle line:90%
was put in our postbox.

00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was a booklet.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And it said, with a
small note, Mr. Ritman,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I think you should have
this in the library.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was so amazing
because it was the missing part

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:90%
of that same particular book.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:90%
That was reunited in this way.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And these are moments you cannot
even imagine it to happen.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And it has all happened
in the past 30 years.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking about
Hermes Trismegistus.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And another attribute is the
ouroboros cyclical serpent

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
biting its own tail.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And to end with the
Staff of Hermes.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful picture
at the end, an engraving,

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
which captures all three.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You have the Greek
Hermes on top.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
In the middle it's
the hieroglyphs,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian Thoth.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And here you have
Hermes Trismegistus

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
in Oriental garb, the wise
sage, the wisdom teacher.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:10%
All three are here
combined in this engraving

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.532 align:middle line:10%
from the late 18th century.

00:13:05.532 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one of the later
editions of the Corpus

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticum, a scholarly
edition in Latin.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
In other languages, such
as Italian, Dutch, English,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
there are also editions
of the Corpus Hermeticum.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
All the books were
very often rebound.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And not only once but
maybe four or five times.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And every time a new binding
was put around the book,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
the binder cut the
paper nice and sharp.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:90%
But we lose a bit of text then.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
the texts of Hermes

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:90%
were translated into German.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see
that was rather late.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
It's 1706.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everybody could
read Latin in those days.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So they kept printing
the Latin edition.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
An illustration like
this, of course,

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the book.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It refers to the Emerald Table,
also a text ascribed to Hermes.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
And it says, so above, so below.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
The macrocosmos, that the world
above, the world of the gods,

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and the microcosmos,
the world of man.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:33.977 align:middle line:84%
>> This Corpus Hermeticum
is also having the Tabula

00:14:33.977 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Smaragdina.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a beautiful engraving
from the early 17th century

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:90%
called the Tabula Smaragdina.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most pregnant
phrases from this very brief

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
text, emerald tablet of Hermes,
is, "that which is above

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:90%
is like that which is below."

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And it just tells you all
about the intimate connection

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:84%
between the macrocosm
and the microcosm.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In this period of time, many
persons are coming to an idea

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:09.615 align:middle line:84%
that there is something hidden
behind the curtain of visible

00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:10.415 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> A hidden meaning
that has to be found.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
A hidden meaning that
has been handed down

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
in the form of tradition,
or hidden meaning that

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
can be discovered through
particular experiences

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
of revelation, of contact with
the divine dimension with God.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.155 align:middle line:84%
Or also with nature,
for instance.

00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
A mystical experience
of fusion with nature.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's climb the mountain.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's try to reach the top.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Or, let's go deep in the earth.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But what you find out
at the end of the story,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
you only find at
the certain moment,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
some persons will
climb to the top.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Some persons who dive
so deep in the mystery.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This hidden meaning can
be found in different ways,

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It can be found in the text.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:90%
For instance, the Bible.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:10%
But also all other sacred texts.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It can also be
found in the Koran.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:90%
We think about Islam.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be
found in nature.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:10%
An idea that has been widespread
since the Middle Ages--

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:10%
God is speaking to us not only
through the textual revelation

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:10%
of the Bible, but also through
nature when we have contact

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:10%
with the natural real.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:90%
We can read symbols.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:90%
We can read signs.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And through a particular
hermeneutical ability,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:84%
which is the
ability to interpret

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:84%
these signs and
these symbols, we

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
can understand the
hidden message.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So we can understand what
God is trying to tell us.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So the only thing
is to open the curtain.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you come in a
landscape of inner reality.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But that will not say
that you reach your goal.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
The man who climbed to
the top and the man who

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:28.434 align:middle line:84%
was diving into the water
to find that hermetic pearl.

00:17:28.434 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The fantastic thing
is that he brought it

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
in a fish bowl
frame, that everybody

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:90%
could touch the experience.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
That everybody could
receive that experience.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is how, I would
say, so mysterious.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Gradually, Hermes
Trismegistus becomes really

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:90%
associated with alchemy.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And he becomes the father
of all philosophers.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And the practitioners
of alchemy become

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
known as the sons of
Hermes, the filii hermeti.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very close bond
between Hermes and alchemy.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
In this library, on these
shelves, you find alchemy.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.210 align:middle line:90%
You find hermetica.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And the two are
very much related.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:10%
Hermes is, so to speak, the
patron saint of alchemy.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
In the 16th and 17th centuries,
people who performed alchemy,

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
alchemists, were known
as the sons of Hermes.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So there is a very
close connection

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
between alchemy and Hermes.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't find many
alchemical symbols painted.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the great moments
also in my interest as an art

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:90%
collector.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It shows the
triumph of alchemy.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
A triumphal chariot with--

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Basil Valentine.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> As it has never been
reproduced and never been

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:90%
looked at by scholars.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
This little painting is
probably unique in the history

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:90%
of alchemical imagery.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> A lady, who is the
negative side of alchemy,

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
tries to attract, I would
say, the pseudo-alchemists.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:10%
All the real adepts
were taking the secrets

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:10%
of the keys of Basil Valentine
to the real process of alchemy.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I only recognized it because
I was looking in an old book.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And there it was redrawn.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
recognized this drawing.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the picture
that Mr. Ritman

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:84%
has hanging on his
wall for 20 years.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I took a closer
look and found out what

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
an extremely rare
piece we have here.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, the imagery of
the library is so interesting

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:84%
because the symbolic engravings
and drawings that you will find

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
in many books of this library,
they contain the same elements.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Like the circle and the
square and the triangle.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And their meaning is,
in fact, universal.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:10%
But there is endless ways that
these symbols can be applied,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:10%
whether in the work of
Christian Kabbalists

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:10%
or in the works of
a mystic like Jakob

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:10%
Boehme or a Christian hermetic
thinker as Robert Fludd.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I was always very curious.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I was never satisfied
with explanations.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
let me go and look

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to the reality of things.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I
knew, that I was

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
a spark between the
invisible life as a spark

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%
and then disappear again.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Ritman disappeared.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So I ask myself, when I am
only a spark, a light flash

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
in a moment, why I should not
build a library of awareness,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of research.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:10%
I started this library
with the hermetic science.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic science is a
science of all awareness.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:90%
I am convinced.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
With the Hermetic tradition,
you come into contact

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
not only with people,
but also with religions,

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
with mystery schools,
with initiates.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the mystery
schools around the world,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
they connected to
the master plan

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and with the flow of
human awareness through,

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I would say, the millenniums.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
This millennium is a
completely different paradigm

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
of references than what we
saw, so far, in the last 5,000

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Different developments
of religion.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Different developments
of spirituality.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And now it comes together
in one global goal.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:90%
And that is, for me, gnosis.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Gnosis.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticism, agnosticism,
they have the same roots

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:84%
in all the stories, in all
the religions of the world.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with, I
don't want to call it God.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:90%
But I want to call it Creator.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Creation.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:90%
And creation and men.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The three aspects of, I
would say, the divine.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:90%
The element of nature.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The two elements of nature,
the male and the female,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:90%
come together in a macrocosm.

>> Gnosticism.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They speak about
light and darkness.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The point in Hermeticism
is that they don't reject

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:90%
the gnostic approach of life.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But they say it is the
task of a human being,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:84%
through daily experience
in your life, where

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
you meet positive and
negative influences,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to come to the point that they
are always going together.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:90%
That they have a meaning.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
If we don't see that
this library has meaning,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
if we don't see that the
last 12,000 years are also

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of the waves of
life, if we don't see that,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:84%
then we don't come to a
point of concentration.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%

point of concentration.

>> Of all the books
in the Ritman Library,

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I love the hermetic
books most because to me,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
this hermetic worldview, the
relation between god, kosmos,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
man, is the essence of
human consciousness.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:84%

all religious and philosophical

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's most important
is that a human being, him

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:90%
or herself, it's about us.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It's about you.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about me.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetic
tradition it's said,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
when you want to know
God, know yourself.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Study nature.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:10%
And you will know God.

everything is not OK is that we

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:90%
lack knowledge.

Knowledge of a
dimension that we don't

the biggest problem

that the universe is constructed
only on the basis of matter.

for the spiritual
aspects of reality.

When it came to religion the
biggest problem that was felt

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
was seen in the presence
of dogmatism, the idea

churches had sort of become

by an accusation of heresy
by the Catholic Church.

brought him to the stake.

who don't want to know.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.350 align:middle line:10%
>> There are traditions related
to alchemy, to astrology,

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:55.490 align:middle line:10%
and also very much to magic that
are still present in the Middle

the protagonist of the
Fama Fraternitatis,

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
also visited Fez,
the city in Morocco.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's been established
recently that the rules

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
of the brotherhood--
four of them--

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
are actually based on those
of a Sufi community in Fez.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's really remarkable
that it's presented

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
as a magical tale almost.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:32.190 align:middle line:10%
But of course, like magic, it
also has its roots in reality.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what the Fama
Fraternitatis urged

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.200 align:middle line:90%
was a reformation.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.980 align:middle line:10%
Also, because they were
Paracelsians and therefore

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.970 align:middle line:10%
physicians, they also
urged their colleagues

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.940 align:middle line:10%
to cure people for free.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%

he wants to improve
something in the building.

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And he sees a small nail
in the wall and he thinks,

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:37.630 align:middle line:90%
I should tear that out.

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And when he does
he finds a door.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they carefully take
everything away and open

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the door they find the grave

Man has an inner

to the world of the senses, to
the world of the imagination,

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:51.760 align:middle line:10%
to define reality.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%

life in itself is not something

that you can put like a picture

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.560 align:middle line:90%
There is no frame for life.

There is no limit

>> There is one element that
connects all these worlds.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the human soul.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
All the impressions that we
obtain through our senses

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
also give us an
image, a sensation.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We can connect all we see
and smell to our imagination.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.080 align:middle line:10%
But our imagination is also,
again, a tool of the soul.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:42.330 align:middle line:10%
Because when we imagine
us to be a bird,

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:44.830 align:middle line:10%
as it is said in the
Corpus Hermeticum,

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:48.390 align:middle line:10%
we are already there,
high in the sky.

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And a human being,
with his imagination,

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
can grasp some meaning of
being of the divine world.

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's what is shown here.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So with our ratio, our
intellect and our spirit,

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
we can enter the divine world.

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:12.250 align:middle line:10%
He says also, the divine world
is in constant interaction

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.360 align:middle line:10%
with the whole world.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.580 align:middle line:90%
But also with the human mind.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.420 align:middle line:90%
So it works both ways.
