00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>From its ancient
roots in India

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:84%
to the streets of Times
Square, the essence of yoga

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.646 align:middle line:84%
has found its way into many
walks of life, many cultures,

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
and many forms of expression.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
While some perceive yoga as
just another fitness trend,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
there is a growing wave
of people around the world

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
who recognize the
deeper invitation

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
of yoga that has
always been there,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
not just to strengthen and
energize our body, but to alter

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of our being and
to bring us back into connection

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
with our own true
nature, with each other,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:90%
and with the world around us.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.026 align:middle line:84%
Can yoga really effect
positive change in the world?

00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:09.041 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:10%
>>We're living in
a time today where

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.906 align:middle line:10%
there is enormous addiction
and stress in the world.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:10%
We're also living
in a time where

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880 align:middle line:10%
yoga has exploded in
the Western world,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:10%
really over the last 20
years, if you look at it,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
but particularly, over
the last 10 years.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:90%
And so you ask why now.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Why is this a trend?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Is yoga going to
come and then go?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I think necessity is really
the mother of invention.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And the necessity right now
is people are suffering.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
They need some relief
from the stresses of life.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We live in this great
information age.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Literally, we receive the
same amount of information

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and have to process that
information in a single week

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and as our ancestors
100 years ago received

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
in their entire life.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the reason why yoga
is so popular around the world

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
is that it speaks
to something that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:90%
is universal within all of us.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it
that the cells realize

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're living
in unusual times,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's not so normal
to be at a desk 24 hours,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that what's happening to
the pollution in the world

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:90%
is not normal.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like our
cells are waking up

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to what we can do to
really create more health,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
vitality, to detoxify in our
body, our mind, our spirits.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think this
centering of yoga

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
around breath and
universal movements

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
such as rising and grounding
give a way for everybody

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to find their connection
to the great potential that

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:90%
is within us all.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>What inspires me
about yoga is the way

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that it actually is
inclusive of all living

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and of all aspects of your life.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There are some assumptions
that you need a rubber mat,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
you need the right time of day,
you need the right clothing.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But yoga is actually, from
his heart and from its root,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
about the way that we live
in the entirety of our life.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:10%
>>The methodology that's
laid out with yoga

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:10%
helps someone to literally
systematically move

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:10%
from a place of
darkness to light.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Yoga for me is
really this force

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that brings us together, that
creates a sense of union,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
a sense of wholeness, the
coming together of mind and body

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, the linking of
personal finite existence

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
with infinite
existence, if you will.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Yoga, it's not what you do.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:10%
Great, you do postures.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:90%
You perfect postures.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But yoga is not
only what you do.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Yoga is what you are.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
In the yoga class,
maybe you can get A+.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But the yoga of
life, a life of yoga,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
is very different, where you
have to live a life of yoga.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
It means how to be calm,
how to stay focused,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.605 align:middle line:84%
how to stay disciplined,
how to stay united.

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And that, yoga gives you.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Yoga and meditation
is which gives you

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
the true meaning
of relationship,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the true meaning of
relationship is that you

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:90%
live for the sake of others.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not a give and take.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It's give, give, and give.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
giving and that kind

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of living, which becomes
giving is living and living

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is giving, sharing and caring,
that becomes true yoga.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you will be
doing yoga on your mat.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:90%
What about off the mat?

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
On the mat is you
get A+ in your class.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But off the mat is you
live yoga every minute,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:90%
every moment in your life.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.499 align:middle line:84%
And your whole life
becomes meditation.

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Your whole life because yoga.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>>The ways in which I see yoga
helping to create a better

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:10%
world is that if more and
more people were applying

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.612 align:middle line:10%
the tools of yoga,
it changes the way

00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:10%
that you experience yourself.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It changes your ability
to be present in conflict

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and in varying circumstances
so that you can approach

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
all situations from a space of
more mindfulness, compassion,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And if we were all engaging
with that capacity of humanity,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:90%
then peace would be inevitable.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
The concept of seva is service.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It's to engage.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It's to reach when others
would withdraw, to embrace

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:90%
when others would reject.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Very often, it's considered
selfless service.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have a
connection to that word

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
because any service that I
have done any time that I've

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
been in the privilege
or had the privilege

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:84%
of being a part of
someone else's experience,

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I've received way more
than I can possibly give.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that
emotionally, spiritually.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
The growth, the compassion,
patience, all of this I

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
have nurtured because of the
privilege of being of service

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:90%
to an other, a perceived other.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
What inspired me to
create Off the Mat

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
was really my own interest in
social justice and in yoga.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.207 align:middle line:84%
It was a natural part
of my own evolution.

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
For me, the yoga practice went
from the physical-mental realm,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:84%
to the energetic-emotional
realm, to the psychic-symbolic.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
practical practice that

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
evolved emotionally and then
opened me up spiritually.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, there
was just, well, now what?

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:90%
And it was service.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It was always service.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It was take everything
that you've learned,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and take it off the mat,
get it out of your house,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and bring it out into the world
where it actually matters.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
When we created Off the Mat, it
was with the intention of-- I

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
know what I'm passionate
about, but how

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
do I help other people
find their passion?

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
How do we work to
develop our leadership

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.917 align:middle line:84%
and give them the skills
to go into their community

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and focus on issues that are
actually important to them?

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's animal rights,
or political issues,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
or environmental
justice, youth justice,

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
we want to encourage all
the different voices that

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.180 align:middle line:84%
live within the yoga community
to really step up and out

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and engage and engage
their community.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.825 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, my name's Mark Breadner.

00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
yoga all my life.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It's my absolute
love and passion.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, I've been on
a fantastic journey working

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
with Wayne Tompkins.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be the
first male aboriginal yoga

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
teacher in Australia,
which is super exciting.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're going on this
journey of him finding his song

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and dance again.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So yoga is this
pathway of coming back

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
to our authentic self,
coming to our heart

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:90%
and aligning with our truth.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And Wayne grew up in the 'burbs.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:90%
He's an urban aboriginal.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And so disconnected
from the culture,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from the dream
and his song and dance.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And from our
conversations, he said that

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.530 align:middle line:84%
about three years ago,
that he connected in again

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:90%
with his song and dance.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.162 align:middle line:84%
So he found a new pathway,
a new way to do it.

00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:37.287 align:middle line:90%
>>My name's Wayne Tompkins.

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:39.784 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'd like to be the
first aboriginal yoga

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:90%
teacher in Australia.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.044 align:middle line:84%
And I'm from the Wiradjuri
tribe, the biggest

00:08:46.044 --> 00:08:47.085 align:middle line:90%
tribe in New South Wales.

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a myth
now that's saying in words.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
What tribe?

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.532 align:middle line:90%
What people?

00:08:57.532 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:90%
We're all vanished.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
We're all lost.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where to go.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if we're
going forward or back.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And what yoga has
done for me is gave me

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
my new culture
and my new belief.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to share this
with all the young people,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
aboriginal young women and
men, share this with them

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and show them what
it's all about.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.331 align:middle line:84%
But you gotta have the right
tools to go through in life.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And yoga is the tool
I'm using at the moment.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.525 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful that
what I found in yoga,

00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%
a very spiritual connection.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.253 align:middle line:84%
I've got a connection again
with the spirit in myself.

00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:38.366 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-taught practice.

00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Good teacher, Mark.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and shows me the
doors will be open for me,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
so I can see what's beyond the
doors, the next doors coming

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:90%
along.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I've prepared myself.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:90%
I can stand up tall and proud.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.973 align:middle line:90%
Be an aborigine.

00:09:53.973 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you gotta
have the right tools

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.895 align:middle line:84%
to be there, like to
hold yourself up high.

00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, the last 200 years,
the aboriginal peoples,

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
the whole story, the whole way
they perceive the world and how

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
they perceive
themselves as a story,

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
as a pattern conditioning
beliefs, has totally changed.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that impacts into
your nervous system.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And then it reflects
into your body.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Growing up in a
hard day, the hard

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
knocks of suburb life
and alcohol and drugs.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it all.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I've seen people die.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.875 align:middle line:84%
I've seen my brothers and
sisters knee-deep in alcohol.

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:36.815 align:middle line:84%
It just grabbed a hold of
them and destroyed them.

00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:37.615 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:10:37.615 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
It took their life
away at 35, 40.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
They were dying-- young.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It's still happening today.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Aboriginal people
are dying young.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.709 align:middle line:90%
I got out.

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I had to get away
from the community.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.587 align:middle line:90%
I had to get for me own path.

00:10:51.587 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>When you go into yoga and
you take that inner journey,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
you've got to face those
shadow aspects of yourselves.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You've got to face
those difficult parts.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And we can't avoid it.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So yoga is going to
take you directly there.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with Wayne,
I take him directly there.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:09.729 align:middle line:90%
There's no escaping it.

00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>I was ashamed to speak.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I was ashamed to
speak about myself.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.372 align:middle line:84%
What yoga has done is made
a foundation, a structure,

00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:90%
that I can talk to you.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I can talk to people.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I can talk about what
yoga is and how passionate

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:90%
it is with me.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.552 align:middle line:84%
Mark showed me the doors
and opened them up more.

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's actually real.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>The yoga community's
amazing, what you call sangha

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.499 align:middle line:90%
because it's so big now.

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got
that, you've got people

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.324 align:middle line:84%
you can come back
to that support

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
you in being who you want to
be, support you being bigger,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
support you taking your gifts
and talents out into the world.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And when we can all do that,
we can do amazing impact.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>But this yoga community, my
new community, is wonderful.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this other
community that I lived in.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It's strong.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
This yoga, it's
strong beyond belief.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:90%
What it is, it's real.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:90%
I can touch it.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.775 align:middle line:90%
I can taste it.

00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:90%
I can practice it.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.682 align:middle line:90%
I can talk it.

00:12:07.682 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ashamed anymore.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of aboriginals are
ashamed of being who they

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.388 align:middle line:90%
are and never want to come out.

00:12:13.388 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's what yoga does.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.116 align:middle line:90%
It taught me how to talk.

00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:90%
It taught me how to hold myself.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It taught me how to-- when I
sit with lovely people now,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy myself.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:31.751 align:middle line:84%
And being around a member a good
yoga community, it's amazing.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I'd like
to share with my people,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and share there's a
bigger world out there,

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that we can access
it through yoga.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.046 align:middle line:84%
>>I really want to see
him make that leap,

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to make the difference for
those kids coming through.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.445 align:middle line:90%
They need-- they need people.

00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:90%
They need someone like him.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:10%
>>Over the last 16 years, I
have seen the pressures increase

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:10%
tremendously for children
throughout their school life,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:10%
particularly for
teenagers nowadays.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
What they have to
deal with, what they

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
face socially, pressures
at school, pressures

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
with their home life,
with friendships,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
with relationships,
and we're often

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
brought in as the last
resort to try and help,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it's with children
who are cutting their arms,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
cutting their legs, helping
schools that have just

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
had a teenage suicide, whether
we're helping teenagers

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
with eating disorders,
whether the whole of year 12

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
is now in the counselor's
office every single day

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
in tears because they're
cracking up with the stress

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
coming up to their final exams.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen incredible changes
happen with yoga classes.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Within two classes, I
had one teenage girl

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
who was slashing her
arms and her legs

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and in tears in the
office, that they

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.371 align:middle line:84%
thought she was going
to drop out of school

00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and not go through
with her HSC exams,

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
sit up at the end of a
yoga class, look at me,

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.572 align:middle line:84%
smile on her face, connect
with me with her eyes.

00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And she took one
look, and she just

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
said, after yoga,
I feel so happy.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
that school term,

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:90%
shed stopped cutting her arms.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And she felt she had
the tools again to cope.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And she saw her way through
it and got ourselves

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.680 align:middle line:84%
into the university
of her choice.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:90%
That was a great day.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I've been asked so many times
about can yoga help children

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
with special needs,
whether they've got autism,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
whether they're somewhere
on the spectrum,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
suffering from ADD,

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
whether they're dealing
with Asperger's.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And time and time again
throughout classes,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I see kids with Asperger's
find a place within yoga

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:84%
where they find the tools
to be able to self-calm

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.415 align:middle line:84%
and have a moment where they can
find peace within themselves.

00:14:56.415 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Namaste, my name
is Gopi Kallayil.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I work as Chief Evangelist
for Brand Marketing at Google.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I also founded a yoga
program at Google

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:90%
for the Googlers called Yoglers.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Yoga has a very significant
role in creating a better world

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
because very simply
put, if you look

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
at what constitutes
a better world,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
it's really the quality
of how people show up,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
express themselves, act, and
respond to different situations

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And yoga, because it works
at a mind-body-spirit level,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
it changes the quality
of how people show up.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So for example, take
something as simple as stress.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
There's an enormous
amount of stress

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
that modern-day living
has inflicted on people.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And just a simple
regular practice of yoga

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:90%
brings the stress level down.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that in turn changes the
quality of life for people,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
reduces the incidence
of sick days, et cetera,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.125 align:middle line:84%
and generally makes them
better people to be around.

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%
As simple as that.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason
why yoga has suddenly

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
become a popular all over
the world is three things.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it is definitely
filling a void that exists.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
When there is a
certain kind of hunger,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I think human beings gravitate
towards the best solution that

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:90%
is available.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And given the pressures
of modern-day living,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
it is fulfilling a need
where it is taking people

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:84%
away from externalizing
their energy to dropping

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:84%
a little inwards, which
is necessary for all of us

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:90%
for survival.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And the second is it's a simple
and highly portable practice.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:90%
You can take it with you.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a whole
lot of equipment.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can practice it.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And third, I think it unlocks
a certain quality of joy

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:90%
when you practice.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel it every time I
finish an hour-long practice

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:90%
from the mat.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:90%
My students feel it.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you experience
that quality of joy,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
you want to go back to it
again and again because it's

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
available, it's accessible.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And through that, people
realize that there

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:84%
is a certain power we
can unleash in ourselves

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
in the way we shift our energy
and the way we transform

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
ourselves inside out
when we practice yoga.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
Well, yoga is a very popular
practice or modality at Google,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
along with the
meditation program also.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
That's widely adopted.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And in many Google
offices around the world,

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
you have access to at
least one yoga class

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:90%
here in the Google headquarters.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
There are, if I'm not
mistaken, more than 25 classes

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:90%
that take place a week.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So you could be dropping
into yoga asana practice

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
class in the morning or
lunchtime or evening.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And these classes are quite
full because again, it

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:90%
is filling a certain need.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Googlers who go to
the class are using it

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
for physical
development, are using it

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
as a way to quieten themselves
at a mind-body-spirit level.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And it reduces the stress level.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, it makes
them feel better.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think the most important
reason is it opens up.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It allows people to drop into
a certain creative space that

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is so important for the kind
of work we do at Google.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a
very powerful attraction

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:90%
for everyone here.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
If you look at any
corporate workplace,

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
things the drives the workplace

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
are the people who work
there, plain and simple.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
They are needed for all the
creative output that comes,

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
for the regular operations
and delivery of the product

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
or service, or offering what
that corporation has to offer.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of the work that
comes out of the corporation

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
is really the quality
of the people.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
When I say the
quality of people,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the
people in their physical

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
level, at the mental level,
at their emotional level.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:84%
If you have more physically
fit people whose brain

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
is at a high functioning state
and who are extremely creative,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
you will have higher quality
products, service offerings

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.634 align:middle line:90%
in the corporation.

00:19:06.634 --> 00:19:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And yoga, there is a
direct correlation.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
If you practice on
a regular basis,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It makes your body, mind,
brain, creative elements work

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:90%
so much more better.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind, there's
no question at all.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It is a no-brainer
that if you have

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
a fairly widespread yoga-based
practice in any corporation,

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:84%
the employees of the corporation
are going to benefit.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.055 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the corporation
is going to benefit.

00:19:32.055 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
your customers are

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
going to benefit from better
products and services.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
The way my teachers
in India, my gurus,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
have taught me--
they always said,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
this is a gift
that we are passing

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
on to through a lineage
that has come to us.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And the best way
you can serve what

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
we are giving to
you as a free gift

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
is to pass it on
to as many people.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have made
up my commitment.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, everybody.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:90%
My name is Dianne Bondy.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Yogasteya,
an online site that

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
celebrates cultural diversity,
body diversity, and the concept

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:90%
of yoga for all.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm really all about
inclusion in yoga.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I think we forget where yoga
comes from in Western culture.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that yoga
isn't an exercise and yoga

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
isn't a really good
stretch, that yoga

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual practice that
was developed thousands of years

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
ago, as far as we can tell--
it may even be older than we

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:84%
originally understand--
to help people

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
express their
spirituality or connect

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:90%
with their spirituality.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I find largely
in the West, a lot

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of that has been
scrubbed from yoga.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people doing work

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:90%
around yoga and inclusivity.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was because
I felt really excluded

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:90%
from my everyday yoga class.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I went to my first yoga
class outside my studio

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and felt not seen,
not understood.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
People made assumptions
about my body size.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
People made assumptions
about the color of my skin.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And it felt really
uncomfortable.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So I decided it
was time to create

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
a space where I could
feel comfortable

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and people who felt like
me could come and enjoy

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:90%
the practice.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I decided
to take teacher training

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and start offering what I
knew and what I understood

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of yoga within my own space.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And that space, I
wanted to develop

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to be comfortable and inviting
and inclusive because there's

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us who don't feel
that way in yoga spaces.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to create a space
that said yes, you are welcome

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
here no matter who you are,
no matter what you look

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.987 align:middle line:84%
like, no matter who you
love, no matter what

00:21:38.987 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
your gender assignment is.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make sure there was
a place where everybody that's

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
been traditionally pushed to the
margins in mainstream culture

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
could feel that this
was a place for them.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that
in yoga culture

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
as well with what the
current aesthetic of yoga is.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to really
shift that consciousness

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and shift that
dynamic and make sure

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that people understood
that yoga is in all of us

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and is for all of us.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has just
as much of a right

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
to be on the yoga
mat as anybody else.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
group of people

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
who really need the practice
who aren't getting the practice.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to figure out
how to get the practice

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to those people, which is
why I became a teacher,

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and why I created my online
site, Yogasteya, and why

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I created the Yoga for
All teacher trainings,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
so that we could be more
culturally sensitive

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and we could create a really
inclusive and diverse space

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
for all people to come
and practice yoga.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:90%
How can we decolonize yoga?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think
we need to pull yoga out

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.710 align:middle line:84%
of the expensive, exclusive
clubs called yoga studios

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and offer them in more
accessible areas like community

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
centers, even just public
spaces, even the park.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I also think that yoga
should be funded or actually

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
picked up by public
health because it

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of benefits for people
who are suffering with stress,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
depression, anxiety, high blood
pressure, emotional issues.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So I really think if it became
more of a public platform,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:84%
it would be accessible
to more communities.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I also think we need to
acknowledge and recognize

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that we are scrubbing current
yoga of its ethnic origins.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And we do a lot of that
when we appropriate culture.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And we remove their cultural
influence on something.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's really
important that as yoga teachers

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and practitioners,
we acknowledge where

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
this practice comes from
and we show gratitude

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's not this diluted,
washed-out commodity that North

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
America has created
in its image,

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're not here
for a good stretch,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're not here
primarily for exercise.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We're here for
spiritual enlightenment.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would be a
big part of decolonizing yoga.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Hello, I'm Philip Hellmich,
the Director of Peace

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:90%
with the Shift Network.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I came into yoga after
living in Sierra Leone,

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:90%
West Africa for four years.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd grown up in Indiana.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
After college, went to the
Peace Corps in Sierra Leone

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and lived in a small remote
bush villages, [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:90%
300 people each.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.130 align:middle line:84%
My friends were and are
subsistence farmers who

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:90%
lived on less than $1 a day.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
No electricity,
no running water.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, I
had a profound experience

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like
to live closely

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth, the
cycles of the crop, cycles

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of the weather,
cycles of the moon.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:84%
My friends had a deep
sense of spirituality

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:90%
connected with the environment.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was just such
a profound experience

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
of how to have a deep sense
of belonging and connectedness

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.229 align:middle line:84%
without a lot of
material consumption.

00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Then when I came back
to the United States,

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I was in culture shock
because of the, quote unquote,

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:84%
"Western pursuit of happiness"
based on consumerism.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It made no sense to me why
people were in such a hurry

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.827 align:middle line:84%
to earn so much
money to buy things.

00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we didn't have time
to connect with one another

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
or spend time in
the environment.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:90%
So I was confused.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, I
met my first yogi,

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
started to practice
in Kriya Yoga,

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and started to tap into
a deep place of peace.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And this peace became
important because I then

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.865 align:middle line:84%
went back to Sierra Leone during
this bloody, chaotic civil war.

00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I went back with a group called
Search for Common Ground,

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
working on the international
peace-building.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was horrible to see
the impact of deadly violence

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
on the villages where I had
lived and my loved ones.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Some friends were killed.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Some were raped.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Some were beaten.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just was in so
much shock, I just

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
dove deeper into the meditation
practice looking for peace,

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:84%
really deeply praying,
deeply, deeply praying,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and then starting to have
ecstatic experiences of love

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.344 align:middle line:90%
and joy.

00:25:43.344 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
trying to reconcile

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
how can this deep joy and
love exist when I'm also

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
seeing villages sacked by rebel
units with child soldiers.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
One village,
[? Bisambo, ?] was attacked

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
by a rebel unit
with a teenage boy

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
named Colonel Rambo,
who was trained

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
by watching Rambo movies.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.582 align:middle line:84%
And so by practicing
the Kriya Yoga

00:26:01.582 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and by working on
international peace-building,

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.892 align:middle line:84%
I started to see
a lot of parallels

00:26:05.892 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
between inner peace and
international peace-building.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I started to see, first
of all, inner peace

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.321 align:middle line:90%
is a global responsibility.

00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
When we have that, we have
a deep sense of compassion.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And we awaken to a
sense of life purpose

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:84%
in the moment of how
to serve, seva, others.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And that provided a sense of
resilience and healing for me,

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go into
this place of peace

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and then to take
action, inspired action,

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:90%
from this inner peace.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And that helped
with my own healing.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And then to work on these in
international peace-building

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see
the similarities.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
International peace-building
and the inner peace

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is all about helping us move
beyond sense of separation.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:10%
>>I spent many years
in the activist world

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:10%
looking out at what was
wrong and speaking out

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:10%
of what was wrong and
speaking for peace, and yet,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:10%
not really having
connected in to figure out

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:10%
what made me feel
peaceful and how could I

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:10%
act more peacefully.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So yoga inherently turns
our attention inward

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and asks us to self-regulate,
to look at our actions,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
look at the cause
of our actions,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and to pay better attention.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we're all
paying better attention,

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to
collectively reach

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
higher and higher states
of awareness and peace

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I've been fortunate
enough, I think, in my life

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
just to discover this tremendous
transformative power of yoga,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that it offers these
techniques to move

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:84%
through emotional, mental
blockages and challenges,

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and really allows you to
find your true seat of power,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:90%
your sense of yourself.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So I share from my own
personal experience

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:84%
of how yoga has transformed
me in a myriad of ways.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
The practice of
meditation has taught

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
me patience--
patience with myself

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and patience with my own
particular loops of thinking.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's taught me the ability
to be still enough that I

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
can actually make very clear
choices about what move I make,

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:90%
about what action I take.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so yoga is, I find,
a very profound pathway

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
for personal transformation.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And it'll meet you
wherever you're at.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>So my name is Rob Ginevan.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of my being of service
is to the military people

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that have served, the
contemporary veterans that

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:84%
have been affected
by the war, suffering

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:84%
from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm able to bring the
power of yoga and meditation

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to these veterans that have
been affected by this service

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to help them
transform their lives

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:84%
through the power of moving
the body, stilling the mind.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have found
that a lot of wars

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
have been fought in the
last 15 to 20 years.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's the contemporary
veteran, which has come back

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and is experiencing-- well,
some would refer to it

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:90%
as shell shock.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But this is post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
About 20% of people
that have been

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
exposed to a traumatic situation
suffer from this disorder.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you could also liken
it to a brain injury rather than

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:90%
a disorder.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to be when images
arise in the mind of somebody

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the brain kicks into
a different mode.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And chemicals are released
around the amygdala, which

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:84%
puts them in a state of
either anger, frustration,

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:84%
or paralysis,
depression, or anxiety.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So by starting with the anchor
of the breath in mindfulness

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and meditation, that
helps to bring the brain

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
back online pretty
much straight away

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and access that
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then by adding some body
movement, as well, to it--

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
so I refer to it as
warrior body movement--

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:90%
we create freedom in the body.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that there's a link
between the mind and the body,

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
we start to unlock
some of those emotions

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and help them to bubble
up to the surface.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And if a wounded warrior is
to maintain a regular practice

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
of mindfulness and yoga,
we've had some evidence

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
now that the brain
through neuroplasticity

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:84%
is rewiring its neural pathways
so that when images appear

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
in their mind that once upon
a time would have caused them

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that trauma, we're finding
that it's lessened now

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
because of the calmness
that yoga is providing them.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And then also, identifying
between their mind

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and their consciousness,
knowing that they

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.810 align:middle line:84%
are two different
things, understanding

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:84%
that the past doesn't
exist anymore,

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
but the present
moment does right now.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:90%
We had a few come forward.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were in some
very dark places.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But working with them,
empathizing with them,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and being compassionate
towards them,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I was able to make yoga
accessible to these wounded

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:90%
warriors.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're seeing some
positive transformations

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
occur from some have been
suicidal to now being

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
reintegrated back into the
community and actually,

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.930 align:middle line:84%
finding a renewed
sense of purpose.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And so by coming back
to the next breath,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the wounded warriors are finding
that's helping them to dissolve

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and I guess create
less of an impact

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.590 align:middle line:84%
with those images or traumatic
memories that occurred

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:90%
when they were out at service.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:10%
So I believe that with
the work that we're

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:10%
continuing to do
with yoga, it will

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:10%
continue to spread into the
mainstream of the military.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And over time, my vision is that
yoga and a mindfulness practice

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:10%
becomes a daily routine.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:10.769 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>My name's Kate Kendall.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm co-founder and Director
of Yoga here at Flow Athletic.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The main thing that
inspires me about yoga

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is, if I go back to the original
reason why I got into yoga,

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in a great place
mentally when I got into it.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I was on antidepressants
and pretty much

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:84%
figured that I was going to
survive or cope, if you will,

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.770 align:middle line:90%
being on meds.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I just thought that's
how it's going to be.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I got into yoga for that
reason, but also out of vanity.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, I thought I was going
to get me nice lean muscles.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look good.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So all that happened, I
toned up very quickly.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But the real gold
was the mental stuff.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Within a month of practicing
three or four times a week,

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I was off my antidepressants.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And I never looked back.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's still, to
this day, my medicine.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that yoga can
help change the planet.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
starting to see shifts.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.252 align:middle line:84%
When those people who
wouldn't necessarily

00:33:09.252 --> 00:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
have done the yoga before,
they start doing it.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And they start to-- they get it.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.440 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, actually, A,
it's not as easy as I thought.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:90%
It's actually quite challenging.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And B, I'm having
these moments where

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to feel again,
where I'm starting to-- shifts

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:84%
are happening mentally
and physically.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.242 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's all about.

00:33:33.242 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:84%
For the past three
years, I've been

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
working with the South
Sydney Rabbitohs, who

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:84%
are a pretty big football team
here, a national football team,

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So I walk up to this first
day training with them.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's just this
massive wall, say,

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:90%
of alpha male coming towards me.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And I really-- I was hesitant
as to whether they'd actually

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.840 align:middle line:90%
want to do this yoga with me.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.455 align:middle line:84%
And so the players are
definitely getting results

00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:84%
from it, just in terms of
feeling more mobile and free

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and recovering faster.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So really with them, it's about
keeping them in the posture,

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
keeping them really
accountable for their breath,

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
staying present, which
for them, isn't that hard.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.650 align:middle line:84%
They're already
winning in that arena

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're given so much
mental training around presence

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.270 align:middle line:90%
and staying focused.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:30.889 align:middle line:84%
Peak performance for me is when
I am so focused and so in flow.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And my mind is sharp.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:84%
And my body builds
incredible and amazing.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And when the two of
those are aligned,

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I have huge capability.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And we all have that same
huge capability when those two

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:50.152 align:middle line:90%
things directly aligned.

00:34:50.152 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>My name's Dominica Dorning.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:10%
And I'm a clinical psychologist
as well as a yoga teacher,

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:58.715 align:middle line:10%
trying to blend psychology and
yoga with a focus on the asana

00:34:58.715 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:10%
practice because I guess that's
something that's really missing

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.430 align:middle line:10%
in psychology is the body.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:10%
And that's a big part of
obviously how we live our life

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:10%
and who we are and what we do.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And so in working
with the people

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:10%
that I do-- so refugee,
torture, and trauma survivors--

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:10%
the body becomes an even bigger
part because of the experiences

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.360 align:middle line:10%
that they have had, often
associated with physical injury

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.020 align:middle line:10%
and torture and
violence and combat,

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:10%
as well as the strong effects
on the nervous system.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only the external
body effects, but also

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:90%
the internal effects.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what we see with
the people that we work with

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is really significant
effects from the trauma

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:46.380 align:middle line:84%
on their internal systems, their
nervous system in particular.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:10%
And what can happen is people
constantly are over-aroused.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So they're constantly in
a state of fight-or-flight

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.727 align:middle line:84%
or a state of stress where
their body is telling them

00:35:57.727 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that something's going to
happen, something bad is going

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.020 align:middle line:84%
to happen, that a
threat is going to come

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:90%
or a threat is here.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The physiology of it
is not calming down.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not going back
to a resting state.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a really easy way to
employ yoga to help with that.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of the really
early stuff we do

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:10%
is just around pranayama and
breathing and introducing

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:10%
the breath as the life
force and this thing that

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:10%
can really bring some relief.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
For the work that I do and
the people that I work with,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:90%
yoga is there on so many levels.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.399 align:middle line:84%
It's there as a response
to the atrocities

00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:90%
that they've experienced.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's there as a
place or as a thing

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to start to help the healing
and bring some relief

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and restore the
part of them that

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:54.470 align:middle line:84%
was there before these horrible
things happened to them.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.200 align:middle line:10%
>>Yoga, for me, is
really this force

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:10%
that brings us together, that
creates a sense of union,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:10%
a sense of wholeness, the
coming together of mind and body

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:13.060 align:middle line:10%
and spirit, the linking of
personal finite existence

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:10%
with infinite
existence, if you will.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I teach workshops
and run retreats

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:84%
around the world for people
in recovery from addiction.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And addiction, for me, I take
a very wide perspective on it.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about the big six--
drugs, alcohol, food addiction,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:84%
people addiction like sex
addiction or codependency,

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:84%
money addictions like
gambling or shopping.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the sixth
is technology,

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
being connected to our machines
in a way that disconnect us

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:90%
from our lives.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So these addictions show
up everywhere in society,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:90%
all over.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I use yoga and
meditation specifically

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
to bring people into
contact with their breath,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to help get them embodied.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I like to say that we help
process the energy of trauma

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.170 align:middle line:84%
through people, out
of people's bodies,

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:07.350 align:middle line:84%
through the work of yoga
and meditation, breath work.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:84%
My dear friend Nikki
Myers says we get

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:90%
the issues out of our tissues.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So literally, it's like that.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.360 align:middle line:84%
We're using yoga and
meditation to access

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.170 align:middle line:84%
deeper parts of our self-- I
mean that physically, but also

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
mentally, emotionally, and
spiritually-- to process

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:84%
negative energies, to process
traumas out of the body

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become more
present, more effective,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.750 align:middle line:84%
healthier individuals
and really start

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to get on our own unique
destiny path, which

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:84%
means the path that
we're supposed to walk.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.390 align:middle line:84%
In classical yoga, there's
really no separation

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:90%
between yoga and meditation.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.890 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
one in the same.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is simply
the state of union

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:84%
that comes through the practice
of meditation, actually.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.620 align:middle line:84%
The physical process, the
physical postures and what

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:84%
we recognize mostly as yoga
in our modern world today,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:84%
is a very small part of
the bigger sense of yoga.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.050 align:middle line:90%
So yes, we work the body.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.800 align:middle line:90%
We strengthen and we stretch.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:84%
We develop strength
and flexibility.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:90%
We get the kinks out.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Mainly so that we can sit for
long periods in meditation

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.320 align:middle line:84%
because the yogis,
the ancients, knew

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
it was in meditation,
in silence and quiet,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that was where the download
was going to happen.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.120 align:middle line:84%
That was where the
real change would

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:84%
happen in the individual,
that in the sitting.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So can we sit still
in a state of ease

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:84%
for long periods
of time so that we

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:53.970 align:middle line:84%
can be in that place
of single-pointed focus

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond the
illusion and the pain

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and the suffering that
comes with being attached

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:90%
to our thinking?

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.980 align:middle line:10%
>>There are lots of
great people out there

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.830 align:middle line:10%
doing a lot of great
work around bringing yoga

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.000 align:middle line:10%
to all communities who need it.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So the future of yoga
is to evolve and grow,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:84%
but not without
recognizing the origins

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and the historical value
and importance of yoga.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So I only see it getting
bigger and becoming

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:84%
more accessible as
more people step

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:28.030 align:middle line:84%
into the arena of sharing
yoga on a global scale.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:10%
>>In yoga, we are aware we have
our thoughts and the emotions.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:10%
We identify with them.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.440 align:middle line:10%
And we feel that's who we are.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:90%
We feel separate from ourself.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Yoga helps us feel that
sense of oneness with ourself

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and the larger whole.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:84%
In peace-building, you're
helping Hutus, Tutsis,

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Democrat, Republicans, Muslim,
Jews, Christians, whatever,

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:84%
move beyond your
sense of identity,

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
recognize your common humanity,
understand your differences,

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:90%
act on the commonalities.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's scientifically
proven, when

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.460 align:middle line:84%
we expand our identity to
include the other, science

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:84%
has proven there is a
sense of compassion.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:06.060 align:middle line:10%
>>Imagine what the world will
look like in 20 years' time

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:10%
if we can impact the lives of
millions of children worldwide

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:10%
and they have these tools to
take throughout their life

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.330 align:middle line:10%
when they grow up.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.720 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at a
much better future.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>>I think we start really simple
in our own acts of awareness

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.180 align:middle line:10%
toward others.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And start maybe even in
your own neighborhood.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Star in your own family.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:90%
And watch what happens.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
When it grows and it
grows and it grows.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Because it is a reciprocal gift.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, I mean, when
we say yoga is everywhere,

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.842 align:middle line:84%
we take down some
of those boundaries.

00:41:40.842 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And we want to help our
sister and our brother.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.960 align:middle line:84%
We want to help
those who have less.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.910 align:middle line:10%
>>I think we're in a really
exciting time at the moment

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.710 align:middle line:10%
where Western psychology,
Western medicine,

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:57.000 align:middle line:10%
Western science, is beginning
to find evidence and catch up

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:10%
with a lot of what this
Eastern philosophy has

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.321 align:middle line:10%
known for a really long time.

00:42:01.321 --> 00:42:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, there seems

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.020 align:middle line:84%
to be a bit more acceptance
and understanding

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.360 align:middle line:84%
for using different
modalities of therapy,

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.350 align:middle line:84%
especially in healing for
people who have experienced

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:18.300 align:middle line:84%
really complex traumas and who
have really complex symptom

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:90%
presentations.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.120 align:middle line:10%
>>For me, yoga plays a role in
helping create a better world

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:10%
because it's about helping
us, those who practice it,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:10%
to come into
conscious awareness.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Right now, I think the most
important offering of yoga

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to the world is helping
us refine our connection

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.666 align:middle line:84%
to the universal
pulse of our breath

00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence
of our breath

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and how that connects us
deeper to an understanding

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:90%
to our ecology.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I've seen is
that as people practice

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
any form of yoga, we become more
sensitized to our embodiment,

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:84%
the food we eat, what happens
to the water, the ocean.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there's dolphins
swimming by in the background.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we begin to
feel this connection,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
not only to the natural
world, into each other.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's through this
more heightened connection

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
that we realize the
power of our life force

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and how to care
for our life force.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>That's really yoga is entering
into the meditative state,

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.850 align:middle line:84%
which leads you to a place
of total union, which

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.740 align:middle line:90%
is the state of yoga.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at yoga from
that perspective these days.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.885 align:middle line:10%
>>Yoga does not belong
to one religion.

00:43:38.885 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:10%
It belongs to all religions.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.458 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to all.

00:43:43.458 --> 00:43:49.950 align:middle line:84%
If medicine is taken
by anybody, it cures.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
Ayurvedic medicine will

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.130 align:middle line:84%
cure only Hindus, not the
Christians or the Jews

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.710 align:middle line:90%
or Muslims.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Medicine is medicine.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.658 align:middle line:90%
Give the medicine, you are set.

00:44:01.658 --> 00:44:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It cures.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.772 align:middle line:90%
Yoga is beyond religions.

00:44:07.772 --> 00:44:10.585 align:middle line:90%
Yoga is strong.

00:44:10.585 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:90%
And to me, yoga is medicine.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Yoga is magic.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:90%
And yoga is miracle.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.870 align:middle line:90%
It'll change you.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Bring the change in your
life, one and all, yoga.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.420 align:middle line:90%
