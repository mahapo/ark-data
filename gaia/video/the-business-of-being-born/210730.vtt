using a midwife?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%

familiar with the word.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.635 align:middle line:90%

that I would think that would
have a type of birth like this.

>> Would you ever have
considered using a midwife?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably not.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I like the doctor aspect of it.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's done.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Surgery-- 1, 2, 3.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Feel it?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You can just pretend
I'm not here.

If it's too early,
it's too early.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.407 align:middle line:84%
Just sit there and do
whatever you need to do.

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Maternity care in the
United States is in crisis.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:90%
It's in many ways a disaster.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Medical decisions are being
made for monetary and legal

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
reasons, not because
they're good for the mother

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and the baby.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Technology is technology.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not stopping.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.477 align:middle line:90%
This is what life is all about.

00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to have good stuff,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
you might as well use it
to get the best outcome.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We should constantly
be asking ourselves,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is this an improvement or
are we making things worse?

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If we don't quickly
take a hold of this,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
lose normal birth.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I call it feminist machoism.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
When you're pushing a baby in
a stroller three months later,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:90%
they'll say, I did it naturally.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I don't
think it's important.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There is so little
understanding of how incredibly

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.335 align:middle line:84%
important this
process is to women.

00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something going
on in the nature of care

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
that's troublesome.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Women have been
told for years now

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
that they're not responsible
for their own birth process.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, what the medical
profession has done over

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
the last 40, 50 years is
convince the vast majority

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
of women that they
don't know how to birth.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> My first instinct is, how
many birds had to die for this?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> This woman comes
up to me and she goes,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
so what kind of birth
are you going to have?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
kind of question is that?

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, when are
you going to be induced?

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, she's
really asking me this.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.917 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm not
going to be induced.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The baby's going to come
when he's good and ready.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just heard how
New York women are all

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%
scheduling their births.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, they're
calling it designer birth.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.445 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I've
heard of designer birth.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, when you
schedule your delivery,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you schedule your
cesarean, and then

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.248 align:middle line:84%
they do a tummy tuck
right afterwards.

00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
well, those are women

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
who have much bigger parties
to attend to than I do.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>> She's already so gorgeous,
I don't know what to say.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I started going to a midwife
for well woman care seven years

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:10%
Unless I had a problem,
I can't imagine

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:10%
going back to an OB/GYN.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:90%
The care is great.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
things that just make sense.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, what was
startling to me was that

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:10%
if you're delivering with
a traditional doctor,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:10%
you might go in and have a
plan and it might change pretty

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:10%
quickly based on a doctor's
decision which didn't seem

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:10%
necessarily--

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:10%
unless there were
medical reasons for it,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:10%
at least try to stick
to your original plan.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi there.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:10%
When I had my
first child, I went

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:10%
in wanting the natural
birth experience.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And I ended up having a
lot of what I considered

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:10%
to be unnecessary intervention.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that I was somehow
cheated from the experience

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
that I initially went after.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like if I
were ever to do it again,

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do
things differently.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.963 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to get my
hands on everything I could.

00:05:42.963 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:90%
I went to birth conferences.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I started to get educated
on all these issues.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that the one that
actually got me so inspired?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I saw her speak at the
birthing conference.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at her with her braids.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get more granola
than this, but she blew my mind.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe we can try to
interview her when she's doing

00:06:00.258 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:90%
a conference or something.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It became my passion.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
do a project where

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I could explore the system
of birth in this country

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and raise questions as to are
we benefiting mothers and babies

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I put the tube
in the baby's head?

00:06:17.388 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Only if I can
do the episiotomy.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, most obstetricians--
most of them have no idea

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:10%
of what a birth can be like.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Very few doctors have
ever observed a normal birth

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:10%
in medical school
or in the hospital.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:10%
It's almost an oxymoron.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:10%
>> How often do you get to
see a fully natural birth?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Rarely.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost never.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I always think that
midwives do a better job

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:10%
at the normal
deliveries than we do.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
For a normal, low
risk woman, it's

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:90%
overkill going to a doctor.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just too much.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.287 align:middle line:84%
The doctor is not really
excited about things

00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:90%
when they're normal.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The EEG, the BP
monitor, and the ABV.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, doctor.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And get the
machine that goes--

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
ping!

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because obstetricians
are socialized to search

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
for pathology, they often
see pathology where it

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They find pathology, because
then they have something to do.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> An obstetrician
is a trained surgeon.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:10%
And usually very, very good
at what he or she does.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:90%
And thank goodness we have them.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that
we have obstetricians.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:10%
>> They're surgeons.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:10%
They should be doing
surgery all day,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:10%
every day when it's needed.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They should not be doing normal
births, because they're not

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:90%
trained in it.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
They have no idea how to do it.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Everywhere else in the
world, that's what they do.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You can go to Great Britain,
you can go to France, Germany,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Scandinavia,
Australia, New Zealand,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Japan-- go to all the
highly developed countries

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
where they are losing fewer
women and fewer babies

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:90%
around the time of birth.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And what do you see?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
You see midwives attending
70% or 80% of all the births.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors
are there to take

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
care of the small percent that
develop the complications.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That is the proven system
everywhere in the world.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And the United
States stands alone.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:16.577 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.577 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States is ranked
poorly in terms of infant

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:90%
mortality.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:10%
If you look only at the seven
countries that had at least

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:10%
400,000 births, it's last.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the arguments
that's made is

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
that's because we
have different women--

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that we have more
high-risk women.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But this blaming of
women is farcical.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not about mothers.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It's about the way we treat
care in the United States.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But nobody ever wants
to admit there's

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
a difficulty inherent
in the system.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the outcome
when you are a century

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:90%
or so post-midwives.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:90%
You lose a lot of knowledge.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:10%
And we're the one country when
birth went into the hospital,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:10%
the midwives didn't
go there with it.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> In the early 1900s,
physicians mostly in the East,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
but also in the deep
South to some extent,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
went on a very effective smear
campaign against midwives.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:10%
They would make posters
showing a Black granny

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:10%
midwife in a very poor home
delivering a baby and saying,

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:10%
would you want this kind of
person to deliver your baby?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It was a cultural shift
where midwives were portrayed

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:10%
as a vestige of the old country.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:10%
They were dirty.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:10%
They were ignorant.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:10%
They were illiterate.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And so hospitals were offered as
this gleaming, wonderful place

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:10%
where you could go
and have a baby that

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:10%
would be cleaner and safer.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:10%
The reality, of course,
was that giving birth

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.832 align:middle line:10%
with an obstetrician
at that time

00:09:50.832 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:10%
was much more dangerous than
giving birth with the midwife,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:10%
because doctors were
graduating from medical school.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Many of them had not
witnessed a live birth

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:90%
before they set out to practice.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened was the OB/GYN
specialty hospital started

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:90%
to sprout up.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And those professionals
started to multiply.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:90%
And they needed a job.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Business took over.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, the
concept of normal changed.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Obstetrics-- I said
in the New York Times,

00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
my wife is mad at
the way I say this.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.537 align:middle line:10%
So I'll say it the way
she wants me to say it.

00:10:46.537 --> 00:10:50.135 align:middle line:10%
It's 98% not exciting
and 2% sheer terror.

00:10:50.135 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know when the
2% terror is going to happen.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from being
completely normal to 2% terror.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:90%
And when you're in a hospital--

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like
hospitals, in general.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea that they're not
healing places in general.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But they are good for
when you have that terror.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> My issue is for those
women that have the normal--

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
the 90% that have
no complications.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
They come through the hospital
and they're put through these--

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
it's like a system where
they're flat on their--

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, totally.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> They want a natural birth.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.762 align:middle line:84%
They want to have
a vaginal birth.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these things
that are stacked against them.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:21.535 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.398 align:middle line:84%
>> They've told
women, come to us.

00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:10%
We'll take care of
everybody's birth.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter what
kind of birth you want.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:90%
We're open to anything.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you get there and
you realize, no, the hospital

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
system is really set up one way
to handle one kind of birth.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And you just get put
through that system.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fight to try to not
get put through that system.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, she was 2 to 390.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.673 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This is Pitocin, which is the
medication given through the IV

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:90%
that causes contractions.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
2, induction is doing fine.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Just check the tube on fit.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.982 align:middle line:84%
>> How much Demerol
were you going to give?

00:11:52.982 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Room 3 being induced.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.218 align:middle line:90%
>> Give the equivalent of--

00:11:56.218 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Just be sure you're
going up on the Pit.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Just make sure that she's
on Pit and that's something

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:90%
happening with her induction.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Pit her means to basically
instructing the nurse to start

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Pitocin.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked to keep
upping the Pit.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably about 90% of our
patients at some point are

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:90%
on some type of augmentation.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> She's not anywhere
near adequacy,

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:90%
so we would have to keep it up.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're not making that
change in that segment of time

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking for,
then we're going to try

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate things.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe start Pit?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So we have the Pitocin.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Pit at 6:30.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Hospitals are businesses.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:10%
They want those beds
filled and emptied.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:10%
They don't want women hanging
around in the labor room.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.212 align:middle line:10%
You have this feeling
of the hospital

00:12:33.212 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:10%
where there's a limit to how
long you can be in labor.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's been 12 hours,
so now you need Pitocin.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I did know the pressure was
on as we got into 20 hours,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:90%
21 hours.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> At the hospital,
I had Pitocin.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And then that made me itchy,
so they give you something else

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:90%
for your itching.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew once they
gave you that Pitocin,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:90%
you need the epidural.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You feel better now
that you have the epidural?

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God, yes.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And then things
come on really strong,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
so then you get an epidural.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you're uncomfortable,
we can always give you more.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.797 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very easy for them
to start doing things that we

00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:07.455 align:middle line:84%
hadn't really wanted them to
do, like Pitocin and whatnot,

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
because I already
had the IV in my arm.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't really
give you the option.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.062 align:middle line:84%
>> And then another epidural,
because nothing was happening.

00:13:14.062 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You're having a
contraction right now.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.822 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't feel the pain.

00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Automatically, they were
like, oh, you need an epidural.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.605 align:middle line:90%
We'll get the anesthesiologist.

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So she's getting
her epidural,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.938 align:middle line:84%
then we'll put in the
Foley bulb for induction.

00:13:23.938 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> They gave me another
drug called Stadol.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> 17 hours of Pitocin.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> They gave me that and
I remember that made me--

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what's going on?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Cervidil was the end.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Once Cervidil happened, any
chance beyond that was gone.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I hated that drug.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It seemed to me that once
they started an intervention,

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:90%
they all just--

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.343 align:middle line:90%
it was a domino effect.

00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:49.385 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole thing is like
a big snowball effect.

00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> In the hospital, you're
not allowed to have very long

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:90%
labors.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you are not
dilating rapidly,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
which you're likely
not to do if you

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
get an epidural early in labor,
you will be given Pitocin.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll put the
Pitocin in the IV.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:90%
It will flow into your veins.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Pitocin makes contractions
longer and stronger and closer

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
together, so then the pain
of labor is much worse.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So you go with that for a while
because you have the epidural,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
but eventually the pain
of the contractions

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:90%
is overwhelming the epidural.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You need to up the epidural.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And then labor slows down
more because of that,

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:90%
so then you need more Pitocin.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Now you're not feeling the
pain of the extra Pitocin

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because you've got the
epidural, but your baby

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is getting compressed blood an
oxygen supply, because Pitocin

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
contractions last so
long and are so strong,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
the blood and oxygen flow
to the baby is compromised.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So then the baby's likely
to go into distress.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:10%
And then you're sent off
for an emergency cesarean

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:10%
from a baby in distress
from contractions

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:10%
induced by the
Pitocin, which was

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:10%
necessitated by the epidural.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Step by step, one
intervention leads to a series

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:90%
of interventions.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.428 align:middle line:84%
And the net result is the mother
finally ends up with a cesarean

00:14:59.428 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and everybody says,
thank God we were

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
able to do all those
interventions to save

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
your baby.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the
matter is if they

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
didn't stop the cascade of
interventions, none of that

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
would have been necessary.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:10%
>> There is clearly an
association with induction

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:10%
of labor and cesarean delivery.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> People don't have
the information.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
obstetrics in general,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:84%
there's been a series of
very intense interventions

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that physicians have
been doing day in

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and day out to
millions of women.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a
medically justified reason

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:90%
for doing those things.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Even common sense-- I mean
the idea of lying down

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
with your legs up being the most
comfortable or logical position

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.651 align:middle line:90%
to give birth.

00:15:40.651 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The more you can move through
your labor and the more you can

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
move through contractions,
they don't seem as intense.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:10%
To lay still-- it's like,
who would want to do this?

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:10%
I just want to get out of
this bed and move my hips.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The lithotomy position
is the most physiologically

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional position
ever invented for birth,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
because putting the mother flat
on her back literally makes

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:90%
the pelvis smaller.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It makes it much more
difficult for the woman

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to use her stomach muscles
to push, and therefore

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
makes it much more likely
that an episiotomy will be cut

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
or forceps will be used or the
vacuum extractor will be used.

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:10%
>> When the baby
goes in the womb,

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:10%
she starts the birth like
this, and then go like this.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But when he finds a little
spot here in the spine,

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:90%
then he needs to do like this.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
the mother probably

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:90%
is going to shake the pelvic.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
the baby's moving,

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and then he goes
a little bit more.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he needs
to do it again.

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Women have given up
their autonomy about birth.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Women are so afraid of
birth, because you do not

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:10%
have an image of what
birth looks like.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Women in America don't know
what's normal about birth.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> They watch A Baby Story
and they watch Maternity Ward.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:90%
They watch these programs.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
lot of fear instilled

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:90%
in women around birth.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Every birth that you see on
television is women screaming

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:10%
and being rushed down the
hallway and looking like

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:10%
an absolute dire emergency.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:10%
So why should women feel
confident about giving birth

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:10%
when the whole culture is
telling them this is scary,

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:10%
this is dangerous?

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.603 align:middle line:10%
>> Women expect to have
traumatic experiences.

00:18:06.603 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:10%
That's why they're
all having epidurals,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:10%
because they're terrified
of what this is.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The births on television
are very dramatic.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I would be extremely
frightened, too,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
if I saw these
women strapped in.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:10%
There is always
some sort of danger,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:10%
that the doctor comes
in and saves the women.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Mommy, the baby's heart rate
is going a little bit down.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.263 align:middle line:90%
And I don't like that.

00:18:26.263 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So next contraction,
if you're not

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.305 align:middle line:84%
going to push the
baby out by yourself,

00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I will help you with the vacuum.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, if
people are playing

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the your baby's in
danger card, that's it.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:90%
That's when the battle is over.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Mommy, we need to
deliver this baby, OK?

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Listen to me.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You need to concentrate about
your contraction, and push.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of the great
manipulative techniques that

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are used is when a woman
starts to question-- wait,

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
why do we need to do this?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Wait, is there something
else we can do?

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
you turn to is, oh,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:90%
it's for the good of the baby.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.672 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not it is,
you'll do anything,

00:18:57.672 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
because if you go on to
question it, well, then

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:90%
you're a bad mom.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
So who's going to do that?

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been about two hours,
so I recommend a vacuum-assisted

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:90%
delivery.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if I'm just going
to pull the baby out of you.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
assist in your effort.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Because it's time.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You get a one-sided story
and it's very easy to convince

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
a woman to have this
procedure or that procedure,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
especially because there's
a huge power disparity.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the risk to the baby?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Minimal.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're in labor
and the doctor says, wow,

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to do X.
You're going to say, yeah.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:10%
We better do X. The doctor
may think he's offering you

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:10%
an option, but you
hear the expert

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:10%
advising you to do something.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> What do I do?

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing, dear.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:90%
You're not qualified.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sedate her.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Number the child.

00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Measured its blood
type and isolate it.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm totally
curious about your project.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry I don't know more
about your work and who you are

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:10%
and how long you've been
working on this project

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:10%
and what got you interested
or fascinated and all

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:10%
of that stuff, Abby, for sure.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Ricki is the one who--

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Ricki had two births,
the second one at home.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:10%
So she brought me into
this just as a filmmaker.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:10%
And then I just happened
to get pregnant.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:20:17.515 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Are you pregnant now?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, congratulations.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:90%
One of the reasons.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do this project
is I wanted to explore--

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:84%
for me, having the two very
different birth experiences.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Both really amazing
and beautiful.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was
just as much a priority

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to have the memory of
the process of being

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
pregnant and delivering and the
rite of passage and remembering

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:90%
everything, feeling everything.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.785 align:middle line:84%
And so many of my peers
and women in our society,

00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
they don't care about that.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They just want the end result of
the healthy baby in their arms.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And they don't care
how it got there.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I
really wanted to explore,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like so
many women are missing

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:90%
this amazing opportunity.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And this life-altering
experience.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel like so much of
who I am today comes

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:90%
from that experience.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I know.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It's hugely transformative.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think just
looking at-- you're

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.410 align:middle line:84%
going to be transformed by
your birth, like it or not.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> A woman, as
long as she lives,

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
will remember how she was
made to feel at her birth.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I've explained
birth sometimes,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
at least my personal
experience to people,

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is it's like you switch on
a light switch and you go

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:90%
to the moon.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It's an otherworldly experience.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Nothing compares
to the privilege

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of giving life and the
responsibility of that.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
have the reverence

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and the respect for that,
where do you go from there?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A woman really doesn't
need to be rescued.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not the place for the
knight in shining armor.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:10%
It's the place for her to
face her darkest moment

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:10%
and lay claim to her
victory so that she

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:10%
can lay claim to her victory
after she's done it, I think.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people have described
birth as a rite of passage.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is certainly a
life-altering experience.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a
beautiful, incredible,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
empowering life-altering
experience or it can be

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:84%
a devastating,
traumatic, scarring--

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
literally and
figuratively-- experience.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we can take that.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Stand behind me.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Melba.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Melba, remember, no crying.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:90%
You got to breathe, OK?

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to put
you on a stretcher.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to take you to the OR.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.841 align:middle line:90%
>> It's time, OK?

00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.755 align:middle line:10%
>> We are completely lost.

00:23:30.755 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:10%


00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:10%
And we have even
forgotten to raise

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:10%
the most simple questions.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.604 align:middle line:10%
What are the basic
needs of women in labor?

00:23:42.604 --> 00:23:45.082 align:middle line:10%


00:23:45.082 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that the
midwives have disappeared

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:10%
is a symptom of lack
of understanding

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:10%
of the basic needs
of women in labor.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Like a traveler who
suddenly can realize that

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:90%
he took a wrong way.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:10%
He took a wrong way.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:10%
The best thing to
do in this case

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:10%
is to go back to square
one, the point of departure,

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:10%
and to take another direction.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:24.042 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.042 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's what I
should do-- take Flatbush.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I went to nursing school
at Columbia University

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and then became an obstetrical
nurse in the labor room, where

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I practiced for five years.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
After that, I went
to midwifery school

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and then practiced for a
year in hospital, four years

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
at an out-of-hospital
birthing center,

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and then I began my
own solo home birth

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:84%
practice, which I've been
doing for the last 10 years.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I like to see them
in their homes.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:84%
The rationale for
that is, first of all,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.062 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
the baby in the home.

00:24:58.062 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I'd rather be on their
turf than them be on my turf.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:10%
I'd rather them build
a comfortable ambience

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:10%
that I get to see them
in on a regular basis,

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:10%
so that by the time
it's time for the birth,

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:10%
they know where their
rooms are, their bathrooms.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty much just the
philosophical underpinnings

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.365 align:middle line:84%
of giving the power
back to the woman.

00:25:23.365 --> 00:25:27.632 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.632 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in deep
through your mouth.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:90%
They sound really clear.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:90%
That's really good.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:90%
One colander is good.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I can use that to put
my instruments in,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:90%
the glove and blah, blah, blah.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the placenta,
I have a large freezer bag.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, do two
gallon-size Ziploc bags.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's better for New
York City freezers,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
because you can put
some masking tape on it.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Placenta.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do it.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:90%
You want to go first?

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.197 align:middle line:84%
Or you want me to show you
first and then you take a turn?

00:25:54.197 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You go first.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
think, pretty big?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You think it's
ready to come out?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe that women
who choose home birth,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:90%
they do share something.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It could be just a
feeling that she knows

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:90%
how she wants to do things.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
when she's in labor,

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
she can interact with her
labor in a different way

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
than if everybody is
doing things to her

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and making decisions about her.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Baby.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I checked.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
It is warm.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really close, Lauren.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, what we have to
discover is how easy birth can

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:10%
be when we don't try to
make things too complicated,

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:10%
when ideally there is nobody
around but an experienced,

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:10%
motherly, and silent,
low profile midwife.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Mama?

00:27:07.894 --> 00:27:09.295 align:middle line:90%
>> There she is.

00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody else look at the
time, because I missed it.

00:27:19.392 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Make sure she's
above the water.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Let me just see.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.655 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you need to do.

00:27:33.655 --> 00:27:35.211 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
keep an eye on her.

00:27:35.211 --> 00:27:40.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.508 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:27:43.508 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Cord's a little short.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a little short.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I went online and I found
that New York hospitals had

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
some of the highest cesarean
rates in the nation.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:84%
That actually
really surprised me.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I guess I expected New York
women to be more like, hey,

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking charge.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
So I was surprised.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was scared.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew what interventions
I was OK with.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:90%
And they were pretty much zero.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I really understand
that things can

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:84%
go wrong during pregnancy,
just like with anything else.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want that to be
precipitated, so to speak.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, David, this
isn't looking good.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started to
interview midwives in the city.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:10%
I just feel like
I trust my body.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:31.170 align:middle line:10%
>> That's great.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I really just want to--

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:10%
I have a feeling that this is
the way you run things anyway.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to let my
body do what it's going to do.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And it so does.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't even run things.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Your body runs things.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's respecting that.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like the
guardian of safety

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:90%
and the witness of your process.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I really do firmly
believe, oftentimes,

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
smarter than me.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not that dumb.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I spoke to her yesterday.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:84%
She did not attend
this appointment.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But you were able
to reach her here.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll call her.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Remember, that tongue ring?

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:84%
That's got to come
out before delivery.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You didn't push that long
to have this 9-pound baby.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:90%
You did a fabulous job.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:90%
I was so impressed.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.652 align:middle line:10%
A lot of women walk
in with the ideas

00:29:19.652 --> 00:29:21.183 align:middle line:10%
that I definitely
want an epidural

00:29:21.183 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:10%
or I don't want
anything-- or maybe just

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of sedation.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:90%
She has options.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I know you want to go natural
and do everything normal,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's fine.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
one step at a time.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.468 align:middle line:84%
That's all we can do--
one contraction at a time.

00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
this baby will be out.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:84%
You'll be breastfeeding
and laughing up a storm.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:84%
They all come out,
one way or the other.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I have three
beautiful daughters.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I wasn't
able to have a midwife.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I was high-risk.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So I had an M.D. and he
wasn't with me the whole time.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:84%
He came in to do the
delivery and he would leave.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.792 align:middle line:84%
And I knew then that there's
got to be a different way.

00:29:56.792 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you were saying
you've never missed a birth.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I don't miss births.

00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:90%
I missed one on 9/11.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get back
into the city at all.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the only one you missed?

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the only one I missed.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
The baby's head is
coming down now, Gayle.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, that
pressure will just stay.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.870 align:middle line:10%
But I'd like to know
about that before you

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.145 align:middle line:10%
do your little squat thing.

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:10%
Women come to me all
the time that have

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:10%
had births in a
traditional OB/GYN setting.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And it is a totally
different experience.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And they spread the word.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, it's just
not enough to turn this around

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.190 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> You want to go in?

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You go in.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
28th and 8th, please.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Can I tell you something?

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It is so hard to find
this birth stuff.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the researcher
still doing stuff or no?

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
twilight sleep cribs.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a torture chamber.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at what
they did to them.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:90%
It was a straitjacket.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:90%
They blindfolded them.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What year is this?

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.465 align:middle line:90%
>> This is in the 20s.

00:31:03.465 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The drug scopolamine
was invented in Germany

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1900s.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And American women
found out about it.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Remember that at
that time, women

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
were still being told that
the pain of childbirth

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:90%
was the curse of Eve.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And that it was because of
Eve's sin in the Garden of Eden

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that women had to suffer
during childbirth.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine how the
modern liberated feminist

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
attitude at the time
would be, I certainly

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.540 align:middle line:90%
do not have to suffer.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:10%
And if there are drugs
around that keep me

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.002 align:middle line:10%
from having to
suffer, then I'm going

00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:10%
to go find those drugs,
because I'm a modern woman.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Women thought that it took
away pain during childbirth,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It actually just takes away
your memory of the experience.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So scopolamine spread rapidly
across the United States.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And by the 1960s,
almost everyone

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:90%
was having twilight sleep.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, it does take away
memory, but it also

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.660 align:middle line:90%
takes away self-control.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:90%
It takes away self-awareness.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So women screamed and
tried to climb the walls

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and spit in people's
faces and tried

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to claw the face of the
doctor or the nurse.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So the hospitals developed the
technique of strapping women

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to the hospital
bed with lambswool,

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:84%
because if you
used anything else,

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:84%
it would leave marks
on their wrists

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and then their
husbands would want

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:90%
to know what was done to them.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And so women were
literally strapped to beds

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and left there for
days, sometimes

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:90%
in their own poop and pee.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.565 align:middle line:84%
It was a very brutal period
in American birthing history.

00:32:32.565 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at obstetrics
for the last 50 years,

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:90%
what do you find?

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:84%
In the 1930s, they were giving
X-rays on every pregnant woman

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:90%
to measure her pelvis.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
1940s, they discovered

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that that caused the
baby to have cancer,

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:90%
so they had to stop it.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
1950s and 60s, they

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:84%
had another drug
called thalidomide,

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
which caused babies to be
born without arms and legs.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And then they had to stop that.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But you see, in every case,
it was after the fact.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, they
were giving Cytotec

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to induce labor in women who
had had a previous cesarean.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.990 align:middle line:10%
And they ended up with
hundreds and hundreds

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:10%
of ruptured uteruses and
many, many, many dead babies

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:10%
before they found
out, finally, in 1999

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.060 align:middle line:10%
that they shouldn't do that.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But you see, there's
not a good history

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
in obstetric practice of careful
study of the long-term effects

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:90%
of all these interventions.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:47.820 align:middle line:84%
This is why if you really
want a humanized birth,

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to do is to get
the hell out of the hospital.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Historically, the birth
movement grew apace again after

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.790 align:middle line:84%
it was basically cut out from
under the midwives at the turn

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of the century during the hippie
era, when there were communes.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:10%
And the communes mimicked
in many ways immigration

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.830 align:middle line:10%
communities.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.350 align:middle line:90%
They mimicked extended families.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And so midwives were reborn,
in a sense, during that era.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:90%
>> We wanted the choices.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:10%
We didn't want somebody
else making the rules that

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.460 align:middle line:10%
didn't understand
us-- that thought

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:10%
we were machines instead
of people with feelings.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we knew that
feelings affected birth.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That was part of what sparked
the natural childbirth movement

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.990 align:middle line:84%
was a reaction against the
abuses of the scopolamine era,

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.965 align:middle line:90%
the twilight sleep era.

00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Because some people realized the
only way to get away from that

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
was to get out of the
hospital altogether.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Just as we were
getting someplace,

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
technology caught
up to us again.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
The electronic field monitor
got introduced into hospitals

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.850 align:middle line:90%
starting in 1970.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
the 70s, it was

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:90%
pervasive in hospital birth.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And the cesarean rate in that
decade went from 4% to 23%.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>> See, when I started, only
5% of women in the US had

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:10%
cesarean.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.520 align:middle line:84%
10 years passed, and it was
up to about one woman in four.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And we in our group didn't
need the first cesarean

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:90%
until birth number 187.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:84%
We were going the other way
from the rest of the country.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.325 align:middle line:90%
And we were doing that safely.

00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:54.408 align:middle line:90%
>> Here comes another one.

00:35:54.408 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So that told me something
about the pelvis

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:84%
of the American woman
is just quite fine,

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:90%
thank you very much.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have another
c-section until birth 324.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The number of American
women giving birth by cesarean

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:90%
section is at an all-time high.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> These days, a record number
of moms are giving birth

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:90%
by cesarean section.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Cesarean sections have now
become the most common major

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:84%

section rate in this country is

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:90%
going up, up, up.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:84%
What is really, really
underneath this?

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Cesarean is extremely
doctor-friendly,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:84%
because instead of
having a woman in labor

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.660 align:middle line:84%
for an average of 12 hours, 7
days a week, it's 20 minutes

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:02.977 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be home for dinner.

00:37:02.977 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a study that came
out many years ago which showed

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.070 align:middle line:10%
that the c-section-- if you
looked over a 24-hour period,

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.430 align:middle line:10%
the peaks in c-sections were
4:00 in the afternoon and 10:00

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:10%
at night.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's obvious that
the 4 in the afternoon

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.757 align:middle line:84%
is it's late in the day, I
don't know what's going on here.

the table as an option.

00:37:32.142 --> 00:37:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, it makes the
obstetrician's life potentially

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:90%
much less complicated.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:84%

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%

got at least two hospitals

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:90%

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Just section them.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.032 align:middle line:10%

that, at the end of the day,

00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:10%
if you did the c-section, you
did everything that you could

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:10%
to get the baby out.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.165 align:middle line:84%
So the c-section

oh, we might get sued.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:84%

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:10%
I just had an
elective c-section.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.567 align:middle line:84%
An elective c-section is
like having a Prada bag,

00:38:44.567 --> 00:38:45.775 align:middle line:90%

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:29.143 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.143 --> 00:43:30.435 align:middle line:90%
Should I keep him in the water?

00:43:30.435 --> 00:43:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Here you are.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you're in the
midst of a contraction, right?

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:10%
Taking some nice, deep breaths
and trying to focus on that

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.770 align:middle line:10%
is very integral,
generally, to coping.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> When the home birth
came up, I was like, yeah.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.080 align:middle line:10%
We talked about the
benefits of the home birth,

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:10%
the benefits of breastfeeding.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, the
effects on the baby.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I was very supportive of it.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You feel it?

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the head.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So we know the head is down
and it's going to stay down.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like, wow.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:84%
This is really something
that I hadn't thought of.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:84%
When you just aren't
exposed to it,

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle line:84%
you just believe what you hear
until you see it for yourself.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The research on home birth
is pretty consistent in showing

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that in a supported
environment--

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and supported
means soup-to-nuts,

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that the people there are
trained, that there's back-up,

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that they can transfer
to the hospital quickly--

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.860 align:middle line:90%
all of those things--

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that the outcomes of home
births are very, very good.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Consistently, at least as good,
and generally better than they

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:90%
would be in a hospital birth.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The gist of all the studies
are that home birth is safe

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.842 align:middle line:84%
and they've set guidelines by
which you have to determine

00:44:42.842 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
whether or not a person is a
good candidate for home birth.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.872 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look at
their medical health.

00:44:47.872 --> 00:44:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at their
previous pregnancies.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to be prepared
in labor for the eventuality

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.260 align:middle line:90%
of transfer.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And you have to make the
judgment call in time.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.353 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, delivering a
baby at home, for instance,

00:44:59.353 --> 00:45:03.390 align:middle line:84%
with a midwife or some other
birth person is like me saying

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to you, oh, you don't have
to wear your seat belt when

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.830 align:middle line:84%
you're in my car because
I'm a safe driver.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.990 align:middle line:10%
>> What scares me about
home birth is that--

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, would a home
birth have fetal monitoring?

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not that in touch
with it since I don't do it.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people have this image
that a home birth midwife comes

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.910 align:middle line:84%
walking into somebody's house
with a little towel that they

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:84%
roll up and ask the
mother to bite on.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the matter is,
they bring Pitocin, oxygen,

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
equipment for suturing, for
resuscitation of the baby.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Trained home birth
midwives are incredibly

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.020 align:middle line:90%
skilled at what they do.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> In a postpartum hemorrhage,
you can lose your entire blood

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.995 align:middle line:90%
supply in about five minutes.

00:45:38.995 --> 00:45:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think a mother has
a higher chance of bleeding,

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:90%
you have the Pitocin drawn up.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.330 align:middle line:84%
You have the IV warmed
here right by the side.

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:46.920 align:middle line:90%
You don't wait to go get it.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Fetal distress, cord
prolapse, a fetal bradycardia.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't come up?

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.240 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
get somebody's section

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.220 align:middle line:84%
or emergently
delivered from home?

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not so easy.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.823 align:middle line:84%
>> People think that when you
do birth at home that you're not

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:84%
necessarily prepared for that
eventuality and that everything

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:90%
has to go great, but it doesn't.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The Netherlands loses
fewer women than we do.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:84%
The Netherlands loses
fewer babies than we do.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:17.925 align:middle line:84%
And one third of their births
are planned home births.

00:46:17.925 --> 00:46:20.175 align:middle line:84%
>> So have you decided what
kind of stroller you want?

00:46:20.175 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the one Paolo
liked on the beach.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Phil and Ted.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So you really are planning
the second kid already?

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No, actually.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.580 align:middle line:90%
This is great to go shopping.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.325 align:middle line:84%
She can go shopping by herself
and put all the crap in here.

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.825 align:middle line:84%
>> So you don't
have to do anything.

00:46:36.825 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.527 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Moritz.

00:46:40.527 --> 00:46:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Just right there?

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> He's our editor moonlighting
as camera-person today.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Final Cut Pro?

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see your
abs look incredible.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.437 align:middle line:84%
>> This child exploded
in the past four weeks.

00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly what happened.

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:57.728 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's a lot
of fluttery down here.

00:46:57.728 --> 00:46:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Then the feet
must have come down.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Must be, right?

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Because if you're
fluttering down at the bottom,

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:10%
then it's got to
be the feet down.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Because last
time it was head.

00:47:03.585 --> 00:47:04.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:04.385 --> 00:47:05.375 align:middle line:90%
You can feel a lot.

00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If you feel fluttering down
the vagina, down at the bottom.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Then it's got to the feet.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure enough.

00:47:15.138 --> 00:47:16.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't even need the machine.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.230 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.630 align:middle line:90%
It's butt down.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Those are the feet down there.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.900 align:middle line:84%
His butt's right
down to the bottom.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of growth,
you're right on the growth.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:84%
You're right in the
50th percentile.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.600 align:middle line:90%
And 2 pounds, 3 ounces.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.325 align:middle line:90%
>> So birth-wise.

00:47:32.325 --> 00:47:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're
making this movie,

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:38.580 align:middle line:84%
so we're seen a lot
more than other people.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But we really are
really considering

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.945 align:middle line:90%
going the home birth with Kara.

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Go.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:46.760 align:middle line:90%
I think it's fine.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll be your backup.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I don't know what
that means, being your backup.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I have to talk to Kara.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I can
be at your house.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.450 align:middle line:90%
But I can be available.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And I can definitely
make it that, God forbid,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.310 align:middle line:84%
you come into the
hospital-- not God forbid,

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.160 align:middle line:84%
but if you come in even
because you're tired

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:84%
or you just want to
do it, that you're not

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:16.462 align:middle line:90%
going to be treated as a leper.

00:48:16.462 --> 00:48:17.420 align:middle line:90%
That would be the word.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So you don't come in
and people look at you

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.080 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, home birth, huh?

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you sit over here?

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So you definitely won't be
treated like that, obviously.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not a thing.

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:29.570 align:middle line:90%
But I'd say go for it.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:30.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:48:30.575 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Because that's how we feel.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:35.270 align:middle line:84%
If we changed our lines
at the last minute--

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't change
too-too late.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't mean like that.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.265 align:middle line:84%
But I mean suddenly if I was
still breech at full term

00:48:41.265 --> 00:48:42.065 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:48:42.065 --> 00:48:43.107 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not a big deal.

00:48:43.107 --> 00:48:45.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll know that anyhow,
one way or another.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to have those surprises.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had Moritz
back me many times.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And I could go to St Vincent's.

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.250 align:middle line:90%
We could go to Moritz.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It would depend on what
the circumstances were.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it was just
like I was thinking, well,

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:04.130 align:middle line:84%
if we do a home birth
and we transfer,

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I love the idea of possibly
being able to transfer

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:07.880 align:middle line:90%
to a birth center.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what I mean?

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And you would be able--

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you transfer, you're
not going to a birth center

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.353 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:17.520 align:middle line:90%
You have to think like that.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:22.630 align:middle line:84%
If you transfer, it's because
you need intervention.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.010 align:middle line:84%
My only fear, which
is not even a fear,

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:84%
is that I would suddenly in the
heat of labor change my mind

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and say, Oh my God.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm dying.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I need to be in a hospital.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> You're meeting the midwife
who's going to write the book,

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Home Birth Midwife
Begged for Cesarean.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I did.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:47.460 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> As much as I've had training
in midwifery and as much

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.380 align:middle line:84%
as I've been caring for women
in labor for the last 25 years

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of my life, I would have to
say that I was not your model

00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.585 align:middle line:90%
patient.

00:49:59.585 --> 00:50:00.960 align:middle line:84%
The only good
thing I have to say

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.880 align:middle line:84%
is that I get to
labor in the day.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I would have walked
myself over to Beth.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:09.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm surprised
that I didn't.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.370 align:middle line:90%
You guys stay here.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back with the baby.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So while I was trying
to escape labor,

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:18.555 align:middle line:84%
I met a place that I think a
lot of women meet in labor.

00:50:18.555 --> 00:50:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:22.975 align:middle line:90%
The rock and the hard place.

00:50:22.975 --> 00:50:25.865 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:26.665 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:50:26.665 --> 00:50:30.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Every single woman who
is having natural birth

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.683 align:middle line:84%
feels like that at
a certain point.

00:50:34.683 --> 00:50:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The rock is I'm not pushing
because it hurts too much.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.120 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And the hard place is OK, then.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You're staying pregnant forever.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to hurt forever.

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.512 align:middle line:84%
So it's the most
infuriating place to be.

00:50:54.512 --> 00:50:57.320 align:middle line:90%
That pain is just awful.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.870 align:middle line:84%
In the process, I told
everybody around me

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.160 align:middle line:90%
that they weren't helping me.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.094 align:middle line:90%
Don't move.

00:51:02.094 --> 00:51:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Ow.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.150 align:middle line:84%
That I wanted them to get
out and get my mother, who I

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.125 align:middle line:90%
didn't even want at the birth.

00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I told everyone,
you're not helping me.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Get out.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:11.420 align:middle line:90%
That was just me.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Everybody doesn't say that.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in the bathtub and
looked at the faucet and said,

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.080 align:middle line:90%
it's me.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm either dying or I'm
pushing the baby out.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.890 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I had
a difficult labor--

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.834 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to do it.

00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:29.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to push.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing
for me as a midwife,

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.550 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that
I know how hard it

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.930 align:middle line:84%
can get for a woman who's
going through labor.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I went back to
work, the first woman

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I looked at in labor,
I was of no help to.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I just looked at her
and I said, I know.

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:47.170 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was lost in the
empathy, because I

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:53.120 align:middle line:84%
felt so sorry that she was on
the other side of that place.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.435 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't-- and
that she had to be there.

00:51:55.435 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:04.930 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:05.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.408 align:middle line:90%
>> 10:12.

00:52:34.408 --> 00:52:44.818 align:middle line:90%


00:52:44.818 --> 00:52:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I can never hear
anything on this.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Try like this.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole insurance
thing has been crazy.

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I called and I
said, I'm pregnant.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, who's your doctor?

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't have a doctor.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going with a midwife.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
OK, but which hospital?

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Everyone I talked to
there was just like,

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.640 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean a home birth?

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.807 align:middle line:84%
But aren't you going to
have a doctor delivering it?

00:53:05.807 --> 00:53:06.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:07.652 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so difficult?

00:53:07.652 --> 00:53:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why this
is such a difficult thing.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was acting like I
had a third eye or something.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Officially, 37 weeks.

00:53:14.652 --> 00:53:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll do the beta
strep culture today.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What I really had a hard
time understanding is that

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:22.090 align:middle line:84%
it's cheaper to have
a birth with midwives.

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:24.560 align:middle line:84%
You'd think they
would be all over it.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some hospitals in
New Hampshire where a normal

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous vaginal
delivery is around $13,000.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Hello.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm charging $4,000
for everything.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:84%
That includes the
post-natal care, everything,

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.770 align:middle line:90%
including the facility fee.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So it makes you wonder
what their agenda is.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The insurance companies
are part of the establishment.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
obstetricians who

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:55.360 align:middle line:84%
are giving the advice to
the insurance companies

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:84%
say that home birth is dangerous
or that midwives are not

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:02.020 align:middle line:84%
as safe as doctors and
all of this nonsense,

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the establishment CEO in
the insurance companies

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.447 align:middle line:90%
believes them.

00:54:07.447 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I've interviewed a
lot of nurse midwives.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that as soon
as their practice reaches

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.242 align:middle line:84%
more than 30% of the women
in a certain hospital,

00:54:14.242 --> 00:54:15.700 align:middle line:84%
the doctors will
start firing them,

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.560 align:middle line:84%
because that's too
much competition.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The AMA, as the trade
organization for physicians,

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.860 align:middle line:84%
has a very clear,
publicly-stated stance that

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:29.690 align:middle line:84%
they will not support anything
that allows for non-physicians

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to do anything
that physicians do.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:10%
You want to talk big
lobby, big dollars,

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.050 align:middle line:10%
they can call a lot of shots.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I have made several attempts
to get this claim reprocessed.

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:84%
When I explained to them
that we were clearly covered,

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.810 align:middle line:84%
she agreed that the claim
needed to be reprocessed.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the
computers were down.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what we go
through, all to get paid.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Millie.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:51.973 align:middle line:90%
Is Marcia available?

00:54:51.973 --> 00:54:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> When I called the heads
of the insurance company,

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I met with them face to face.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
our hands are tied.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.890 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, they're not.

00:54:58.890 --> 00:54:59.690 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:01.080 align:middle line:90%
You just don't care.

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not about health care.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not about saving
money for consumers.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about women
and babies, that's for sure.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We got the authorization.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Claims department is not
reading the claim correctly.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm begging
you to get paid.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Your members did
not have to beg us

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.610 align:middle line:90%
to come in and get treatment.

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:18.693 align:middle line:84%
You'll try and
find her tomorrow.

00:55:18.693 --> 00:55:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We talk about
giving mothers options.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:84%
What isn't talked
about is the degree

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to which options are being
closed off to mothers.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:28.490 align:middle line:10%
One example is birth
centers, which at this point

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.380 align:middle line:10%
is at almost an all-time low.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> My decision to not renew
my malpractice came from a lot

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:90%
of different places.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we were
getting letters

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.070 align:middle line:84%
from our insurance companies
saying that they're

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.360 align:middle line:90%
going to increase the rates.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We aren't making
a living anymore.

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people say, oh,
it's an economic battle.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's an
economic battle.

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a billion-dollar industry.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We spend twice as much in
this country per birth than any

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.180 align:middle line:90%
other country in the world.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.380 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those
very rare instances

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.355 align:middle line:90%
where cheaper is truly better.

00:56:09.355 --> 00:56:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It works in all
the other countries.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at our data,
the amount of money we spend

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.920 align:middle line:84%
versus the outcomes
we get, it sucks.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.860 align:middle line:84%
There are countries that spend
a third of what we have and have

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.550 align:middle line:90%
lower infant mortality.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So more doesn't mean
more in this case.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.327 align:middle line:90%
And maybe less is more.

00:56:26.327 --> 00:56:28.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Run.

00:56:28.662 --> 00:56:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are you running so fast?

Abby, this feels a little
bit like living on the edge,

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:49.310 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But to tell you
the truth, there's

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.330 align:middle line:90%
a lot worse edges to live on.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you've been there,
this doesn't feel that scary.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:57:18.170 align:middle line:90%

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.160 align:middle line:84%
put the word home and the word
birth together in the same

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.950 align:middle line:84%
sentence, there's just
hysteria in the room.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then what I always
do is say, OK, OK.

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone in this room
who has ever attended a home

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:40.850 align:middle line:90%
birth, raise your hand.

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.680 align:middle line:90%
They've never seen a home birth.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So then I say, you're all
like the geographers who

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:52.420 align:middle line:84%
are trying to describe a
country they've never been to,

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.135 align:middle line:84%

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
before you can even
get to the baby.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.975 align:middle line:84%
There is blood loss that can't
necessarily be controlled.

01:04:09.975 --> 01:04:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's major surgery.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:14.878 align:middle line:84%
And yet we now present
cesarean section

01:04:14.878 --> 01:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
as if we're cutting
your fingernails.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's another thing, too, that
I think people aren't really

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.800 align:middle line:90%
talking about so much now.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.758 align:middle line:84%
I know so many women with
c-sections who end up

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:23.550 align:middle line:90%
with really bad infections.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:25.857 align:middle line:84%
And they're becoming harder
to treat with antibiotics.

01:04:25.857 --> 01:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's one area where I feel
like we're going back in time

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.065 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, because having an
infection that you cannot treat

01:04:31.065 --> 01:04:33.030 align:middle line:90%
is so scary.

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the deaths that do
take place in the United States

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
happen for women who
went to the hospital.

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Because half the percentage
of women give birth at home.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet our death rate is
higher than some third world

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
countries.

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We have areas in the United
States where it's sky high.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> People in our culture
spend more time and effort

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
researching to buy a
stereo system, a car,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
probably a camera than they do
checking out what their choices

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:01.320 align:middle line:90%
are for birth.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.880 align:middle line:90%


01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Today in the United States,
we know that there is serious

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:14.100 align:middle line:10%
increase in minimal neurological
problems in children

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.580 align:middle line:10%
and in attention deficit
disorders, in autism.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.200 align:middle line:10%
All of these things
are increasing

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.060 align:middle line:10%
at the same period
of time that we're

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.700 align:middle line:10%
increasing all of these
obstetric interventions.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.470 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know.

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And maybe next year
or next decade,

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
we'll discover to our horror
that what happens at birth

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.375 align:middle line:84%
is very important to the future
development of that child.

01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:40.592 align:middle line:90%


01:05:40.592 --> 01:05:43.050 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that we
think happens during the whole

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:47.610 align:middle line:10%
labor and delivery process is
that the oxytocin neurons start

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.870 align:middle line:10%
squirting out lots of
oxytocin in the brain,

01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:52.920 align:middle line:10%
which is the bonding,
protective hormone.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And the oxytocin travels in the
bloodstream down to the uterus

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to start triggering the
contractions of labor.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the switch to
the maternal brain circuits.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.580 align:middle line:90%
The mommy brain gets flipped on.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And the whole brain cocktail
of hormones and neurochemicals

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
has, for millions of
years, been developed

01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
to keep the mommy absolutely
riveted on protection

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.265 align:middle line:90%
of the helpless infant.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:23.970 align:middle line:90%


01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the things to
remember is Pitocin

01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
is a synthetic
version of oxytocin

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that you put intravenously in
a woman when she's in labor.

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
However, Pitocin doesn't
act as natural oxytocin

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
would in the brain.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's all kinds
of things about

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
modern medical interventions.

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they need to
be done, but they also

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
inhibit this natural maternal
aggression to protect the baby

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and to nourish the
baby right after birth

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:52.005 align:middle line:84%
that is normal for mammals
and for human moms.

01:06:52.005 --> 01:06:59.610 align:middle line:90%


01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:06.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Until recently, love was
a topic for poets, novelists,

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.340 align:middle line:10%
philosophers.

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:12.840 align:middle line:10%
Today, it is studied
from multiple scientific

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.260 align:middle line:10%
perspectives, with
mammals in general.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.800 align:middle line:10%
There is immediately after
birth a short period of time

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.230 align:middle line:10%
which will never
happen again, and which

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:26.190 align:middle line:10%
is critical in
mother-baby attachment.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:32.100 align:middle line:10%
Until recently, in order to give
birth, a woman like all mammals

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:39.880 align:middle line:10%
is supposed to releases a
complex cocktail of love

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.790 align:middle line:10%
hormones.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:44.330 align:middle line:10%
As soon as baby is born, when
mother and baby are together,

01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:48.560 align:middle line:10%
both of them are under the
effect of a sort of morphine,

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.550 align:middle line:10%
of opiate--

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:51.560 align:middle line:10%
natural morphine endorphins.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.030 align:middle line:10%
We know the properties, they
create a state of dependency--

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.800 align:middle line:10%
addiction.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.030 align:middle line:10%
When mother and baby
are close to each other,

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.630 align:middle line:10%
it is the beginning
of an attachment.

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:04.750 align:middle line:90%


01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:10.030 align:middle line:10%
But today, most women have
babies without releasing

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:12.430 align:middle line:10%
this flow of hormones.

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:16.390 align:middle line:10%
I'll just give an example
of animal experience.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:22.479 align:middle line:10%
In general, if you disturb the
hormonal balance of the female

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:25.149 align:middle line:10%
giving birth, it's simple.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:27.740 align:middle line:10%
The mother does not
take care of her baby.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.750 align:middle line:10%
It's simple.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:32.920 align:middle line:10%
If monkeys give birth
by cesarean section,

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.710 align:middle line:10%
the mother is not
interested in her baby.

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:41.290 align:middle line:10%
It's simple, easy to detect
on the individual level.

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:45.279 align:middle line:10%
So you wonder, but what
about our civilization?

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:48.540 align:middle line:10%
What about the
future of humanity?

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:53.040 align:middle line:10%
If most women have
babies without releasing

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.710 align:middle line:10%
this cocktail of love hormones,
can we survive without love?

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:02.729 align:middle line:90%


01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:05.430 align:middle line:10%
The point is I'm not
introducing theories.

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:07.140 align:middle line:10%
This is not about theories.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:11.100 align:middle line:10%
I bring together facts,
what we know today.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.069 align:middle line:10%
So the point is to bring
some facts together

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:19.670 align:middle line:10%
at the right time to
create a new awareness.

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:43.819 align:middle line:90%
I think it's position, too.

01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:45.520 align:middle line:90%
You just look carry small.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.742 align:middle line:90%
You're so small.

01:09:46.742 --> 01:09:48.700 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought you
would look really much

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:39.612 align:middle line:90%


01:18:39.612 --> 01:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm working on this
documentary about birth.

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:44.030 align:middle line:10%
And that's been so rewarding.

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:45.920 align:middle line:10%
I feel like that's
my passion project.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Why wouldn't we have seen any
evidence of this in the first

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.040 align:middle line:90%
30 weeks?

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is notorious to
pick that up with a stillbirth.

01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
usually pick it up.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.827 align:middle line:84%
There's this growth
restriction, growth restriction.

01:18:58.827 --> 01:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The baby tries to overcome it,
sends blood up to the brain

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
so they have a nice
bigger head than body.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And then at a certain
point, there's nothing left.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And the kid dies.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.928 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
doing all these tests.

01:19:09.928 --> 01:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So unusual to find it
in the middle of things.

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
That's a good year for
me if I find it more.

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, my lady.

01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm going to stay close.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll be within 10
minutes of you.

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to
hound you and follow you.

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you get a couple
of contractions, let me know.

01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:24.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm very pro-midwifery.

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:28.580 align:middle line:10%
And I really want to shed some
light on the misinformation

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.330 align:middle line:10%
out there about birth and
the fear-based information.

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> If you dare go vote.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Where do you have to vote?

01:19:36.050 --> 01:20:01.010 align:middle line:90%


01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you feel cheated?

01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel like you missed out?

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The other births that we
filmed or that we saw,

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.590 align:middle line:90%
there's just that moment.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like the orgasm at the
end, you know what I mean?

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Where they put this
baby in your arms

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and you see these women
just like, oh my God.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's the
way he needed to come.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't strong enough
for a vaginal delivery.

01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:28.820 align:middle line:90%
He was very growth-restricted.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.620 align:middle line:90%
He was breech.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
He had the cord around
his neck really tight.

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot of factors
that could have been really

01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:37.580 align:middle line:90%
difficult vaginally for him.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.110 align:middle line:90%
I think he would have survived.

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of things were
messed up in the process.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have bonding
right after birth.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We had a very hard
time breastfeeding--

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.652 align:middle line:90%
a very hard time.

01:20:49.652 --> 01:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, thank God, there
was nothing wrong with him.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.230 align:middle line:90%
And he's in good health.

01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But he was such a
surprise in every way.

01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I thought we were going to
have this beautiful home birth.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'd film it,
maybe we wouldn't.

01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really think
we'd end up in the film.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was even
surprised about that.

01:21:08.150 --> 01:21:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Are you smiling?

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Are you smiling at Auntie Ricki?

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:13.200 align:middle line:90%
She was your doula.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.120 align:middle line:90%
She was there.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>> You remember me, don't you?

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:36.147 align:middle line:90%


01:21:36.147 --> 01:21:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Look who you got.

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Look who you got.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.384 align:middle line:90%
>> We got this boy.

01:21:40.384 --> 01:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
