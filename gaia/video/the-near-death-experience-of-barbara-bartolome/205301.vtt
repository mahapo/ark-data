00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:15.398 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a mom and married,
and I had two children,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:90%
and it was 1987.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
My youngest daughter
had just been born,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and she was just a month old
when I injured my back lifting

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:90%
something too heavy.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So about four months passed
with the doctors examining me,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and the first doctor
that I saw said

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:90%
that I wouldn't walk again.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a
neurosurgeon after that,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at all the tests
that had been done on me,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and he said that he
could fix the problem.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I checked into the hospital
the day before the surgery,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and it was December,
1987 when this occurred.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
conduct a myelogram, which

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
is a test where they inject
iodine dye into the back

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
of your neck, in
my case, and they

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:90%
have laying on an X-ray table.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And they then tip
the X-ray table

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
so that the dye will flow
down your spinal cord

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether
the spinal cord was

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
damaged when the disc blew
out of the lower back area.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So they proceeded to
start with the testing,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and they asked me to
hold really still,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
because they said once they
inject the dye into my neck,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
if I moved at all,
that I would suffer

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:84%
from really bad headaches for
quite a few months afterwards.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So I was laying very
still on the table,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and the neurosurgeon and
the orthopedic surgeon

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that were going to be doing
the surgery the next morning

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
were in the room when this
test was going to be done.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It was lucky that
they were there,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
because the person who had
his finger on the X-ray table

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:90%
was pushing the wrong button.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The X-ray table
tipped the wrong way,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
which caused my head to
be lowered below my feet,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and that caused the
dye that they had just

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
injected in the back of my neck
to flow into my brain area.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And it very quickly caused
me to lose consciousness.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I lost consciousness,
I went up on the ceiling.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:84%
As I looked down
at my body and saw

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
the top of the heads of
everybody in the room,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't startled or upset
or frantic or panicked.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a very calm, it was a
very wrapped in love feeling up

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
there, like you were
in the warm blanket,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and everything was fine.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down at my
body on the X-ray table,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear the X-ray
technician next to me

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
calling "code blue."

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't know
what "code blue" meant,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
but I said, huh, if I'm
up here on the ceiling,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and my body's down there,
and he's calling frantically,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
"code blue," I
think I just died.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't any
alarm or worry or panic.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It felt very comfortable.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
In the next second, when
I saw that everything

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
was going into very high speed
resuscitation efforts down

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
below, it seemed really
obnoxious, actually,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
with everybody kind of
yelling at each other

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
and moving very quickly.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a presence
next to me on the ceiling,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and that presence felt huge,
loving, and accepting of me.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling that I
felt with that presence

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:84%
felt as though I had been
part of that presence,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and it had been part
of me for eternity.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It was unbelievable to feel
that love and that acceptance

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and that degree of
intensity that I

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
had in those moments with
this presence next to me.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I began talking to
the presence and saying,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
I really want to go back.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back for my
five-month-old daughter.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back for
my eight-year-old son.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
If I leave them, if I leave
their lives in this way,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
if I leave them at
this time, then they

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
will not grow up to be the
human beings that they could be

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:90%
if I was contributing to them.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to go
back to be with them.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Please, could I please
re-enter this life?

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, I also knew,
up there on the ceiling,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
what my plan was for my
life, what my purpose was,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and I said to the being, I
haven't completed my purpose.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to
go back into my life

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that, to
do what I had planned to do.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Down below, they were
bringing in an oxygen cart,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and they put an oxygen
mask on my face.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And this woman did that.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a woman
that was calling at a desk that

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:90%
was in the corner of the room.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a phone
over there, and she

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
was calling for the defib
unit to be brought in,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
defibrillation, to
restart my heart.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
In the midst of watching
everything unfolding

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and the CPR and
the resuscitation,

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
there was this man that came
in, and he had a small box

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that he placed on a shelf
next to the X-ray table.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
As I was talking to this
being, I was watching this man.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't actually
know what he was doing.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I moved from-- instantaneously,
from the ceiling to right

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:90%
in front of the box.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And he flicked a little
lever on the side of the box,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and it turned on a green
light inside the box,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and it made the box start
making a monotone sound.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And the little green light
traveled across the screen

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
in a straight line.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
realized, oh, oh, this

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
going like this.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was not registering
that I had any heart rate.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized it
was a heart monitor,

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
then I was instantaneously moved
back up on the ceiling again,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and then had the view down
of my body on the X-ray table

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and above everyone,
looking down at their heads

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and the whole spread
out of the room.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:90%
So that was very interesting.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So I saw my own flat line,
and what the doctor did,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
the orthopedic surgeon, he
stepped forward two steps.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, stand clear, to the
people who were doing the CPR

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and were around the head of
the table, and they backed off.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And he just took his
fist, and he arched it

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:90%
from over his head--

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
from behind his
back, and he just

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:90%
pounded the center of my chest.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I watched that from
up above, and I

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
watched my body
react to that blow,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
but, of course, it did
not restart my heart.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And he then arched
his arm back again

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and struck my chest
a second time.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And when he struck my chest, my
eyes simply shot from up above,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and I blinked opened my eyes,
and I was looking straight

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:90%
into his face.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
He stepped backwards, and
the people around the table

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
were stepping back
in to stabilize me.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I started talking
into the oxygen mask.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I was very alarmed,
because I couldn't explain

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:90%
what had just happened to me.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And I was asking that question.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
The nurse leaned over me, and
she said, please don't talk.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
We need to stabilize you.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So I had to wait for
about 20 minutes,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
until they took the
oxygen mask off.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And I then started blurting
out, what just happened?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:90%
I was up on the ceiling.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I could see everything.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I could see what we were doing.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And the neurosurgeon, he
ended up saying, oh, brother,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:90%
really sarcastically.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And that caused me to
want to be believed.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So I said, no, I actually
was on the ceiling,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and I could see everything.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's the person who
brought in the oxygen cart

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and connected it up to my
face, and that man brought

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
in the heart monitor, and I
actually watched it flatlining.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:10%
Then you said this to him,
and he said that to you,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:10%
and I explained the
conversation that the two

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:10%
doctors had been
having just before

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:10%
they did the precordial thump.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
You said, stand clear.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
You stepped two steps forward,
and you struck me in my chest,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't work
the first time.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And the second time that you
struck me, then I came back.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I was up on the ceiling.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And the neurosurgeon
had, by this time,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
since it had taken me so long
to kind of tell all that,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
had turned white, and he
just looked with this, like,

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
look of shock.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And then he just
said, I'm not going

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to stand here and
listen to this.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And he stormed out of the room.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of the people,
all the support staff

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and the orthopedic surgeon,
they stayed in the room.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And the orthopedic surgeon
continued to talk to me

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and say, what did you
feel, and how did you feel?

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me questions,
and I answered them,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and everybody listened.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And then after they
stabilized me further,

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:84%
they put me on a gurney,
and they sent me up

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
to a private room.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, I had
the surgery the next morning,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and every single person
that I interacted with that

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.485 align:middle line:84%
came into my room to check my
vitals, the doctors, everyone,

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I asked them what happened
during that myelogram.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:90%
What was that that happened?

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:10%
I got a lot of different
variables on what they said,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:10%
but most everybody
wouldn't talk about it.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.435 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody didn't
talk about it, but they said,

00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you're talking about,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
or I don't see anything
on the records about this.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And it really closed me down
as to what had happened.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when they did the
surgery the next day,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
my husband came to visit after
the surgery with my children.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And I told him what
happened the night before,

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and he shut me down the rest
of the way by saying, oh,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
that couldn't have happened.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:90%
You probably hallucinated it.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So when he said that
to me, my feeling was,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want
anybody in the world

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:90%
to think I was hallucinating.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, was
a real negative,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and I just decided not
to tell anybody else.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:10%
So I was released
from the hospital

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:10%
about three days
after the surgery,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:10%
and I never actually spoke about
that near-death experience,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:10%
didn't even know it was
called a near-death experience

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:10%
at the time, had never
heard of Raymond Moody, who

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:10%
wrote the book, "Life
After Life," in 1975.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea that anyone else
had ever had one of these.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And so my life continued on, and
one of the things that changed,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
though, was the fact that
while I was up on the ceiling

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and I was telling that being
that I wanted to go back,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
the very last thing was
that the being spoke to me.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And the being said,
if you go back,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
you will still be
in your marriage.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:90%
What will you do about that?

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I had someone who
was abusive and who

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
was very controlling, was
really making my children's

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
lives and my life
very difficult.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had been trying to
give the benefit of the doubt

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of
situations and trying

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to believe that he would
make changes to his life,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:84%
if I just continued
to contribute

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:84%
towards changing the way
that he looked at things.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't working,
and I knew that.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so in that moment,
when I was asked that,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
it kind of stopped me dead
in my tracks, basically.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I said to the being
was, if you allow me to go back,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.380 align:middle line:84%
then I promise that I
will become brave enough,

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:90%
strong enough to leave him.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And right when I
said that, that's

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
when the doctor struck my
chest that second time.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It took me three years
to move in that direction

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
very slowly towards
leaving my husband,

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and I did do that when my
daughter was three years old.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
difficult time for me,

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and I had been very
scared to do that,

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
but that near-death
experience and what

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
happened at the end
of that discussion

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
with me talking
one-sidedly to that being,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and then them finally
saying to me, what are you

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
going to do with your life,
that was really powerful for me.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me, I
think, the strength

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to move out of a very
traumatic marriage

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that I would have floundered
in and was floundering in.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
difficult time for me.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So that started a whole
new chapter in my life of--

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
a very happy chapter
of my life that

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
was a really great
replacement for what

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I had been living through.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And about 12 or so years
later, after the NDE

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
when my daughter
was about 12, I was

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
at a gymnastics practice
for her at the university

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:90%
where I worked at.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
was sitting next to me,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and she was explaining to
me that her mom was dying.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling sad
for her, because she

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
was very impacted by the fact
that her mom's last weeks were

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:90%
happening right at that time.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And something inside me--

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't talked about
my near-death experience

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
for all these years
after my husband

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:90%
said it was a hallucination.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.883 align:middle line:84%
I never spoke to
anybody about it.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:90%
I never researched it.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I never tried to
find out what it was.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the term,
"near-death experience."

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And this woman just kind
of brought it out of me,

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and I decided that I needed to
tell her about it, because I

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
thought that it would help
her in how she was looking

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:90%
at her mom's impending death.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
She was a nurse at
the local hospital,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and so I recounted
what had happened

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
to me during my
near-death experience.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was in awe,
and she said, Barbara,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I know you're
telling me the truth.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how
could you know that?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I never ever told
anybody this story,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and how could you know that
I'm telling you the truth?

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
because what you're

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
telling me is how they
would resuscitate you.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And I know that,
because that's the area

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:90%
that I work in at the hospital.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So what you're telling me
that they did with the fist

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:84%
on the chest is called
a precordial thump.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where I
learned the term from.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And she told me
all about it, how

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
the doctors weren't
able to do that,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:90%
unless they'd seen me die.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So she's the one who
validated it for me.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And probably within
the next few years

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
after that, I started
looking online,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
because by then, the internet
had come into existence

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:90%
for the common man.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I had access, and so I
started investigating,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I found out it was called
a near-death experience.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And I found out details
about near-death experiences.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I ended up deciding to write
up my near-death experience,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and I decided to
submit it to a website

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
called the Near-Death
Experience Research Foundation,

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
which is run by
Dr. Jeffrey Long.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.580 align:middle line:10%
What ended up happening
was that Jeffrey Long

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:10%
invited me to go to
a conference that

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.750 align:middle line:10%
was going to be happening in
San Diego, California, in 2009.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:10%
I thought, oh, gosh,
I'm going to be

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:10%
able to meet people who research
near-death experiences and also

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:10%
other experiencers.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll be able to actually
talk to other people who

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:90%
have had this happen.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I really want to go.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:10%
And the very first
night that I was there,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:10%
I was a little bit
scared, because these

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:10%
were all people I felt
that were researchers,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:10%
and they knew a lot
about the subject,

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:10%
and I still felt like a newbie.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:10%
So when I met Dr. Long, and
I ended up chatting with him,

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:10%
there was a group of people
that gathered around him.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were obviously
researchers and people

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:90%
within the IANDS organization.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It was the International
Association

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
for Near-Death Studies.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
That was the name
of the conference.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And so as I stood there and
listened to his conversations,

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
they were talking about what
the conference subject was

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that year, which
was after effects

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
that near-death
experiencers have.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are
common after effects

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that they had been
researching, and they

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:90%
were talking about them.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So as I listened, I was
just really disconcerted,

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.780 align:middle line:84%
because I felt that the after
effects that they were naming

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
were not after
effects that happened

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:90%
after my near-death experience.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I was alarmed, because it was
like they were naming things

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that were resonating for me
all the way back to my earliest

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%
childhood memories.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So after they finished
talking in kind of a group

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
conversation, people
turned to each other

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and were just kind
of conversing.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And this woman was
standing next to me.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I turned to her, and I said,
I just don't understand.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
If the after effects are
what you're saying they are,

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:84%
why would I have them all the
way back to my early childhood,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:84%
not just after I had my
near-death experience?

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know her name,
and it was PMH Atwater,

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and she's written about 16 books
about near-death experiences.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And she took her hands, and
she was so calm and comforting,

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:10%
and she said, my dear, I
think that you should talk

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:10%
with your family,
because if you've had the

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:10%
after effects that we were
just talking about all the way

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:10%
back to your early
childhood, there's

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:10%
a great likelihood that you
had another experience when

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:10%
you were young.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time, I have to
admit that I thought, oh, wow.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:90%
That's wacky.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that I had a
near-death experience when

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I was young.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't my parents
or my siblings,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
my older siblings at least,
have told me about that?

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I thought, my parents are
dead, and I can't ask my mom

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:90%
what that might be about.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So I went--

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I was going up to
Oregon to visit

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
my older brother about a
month after the conference.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I had never told
any of my family

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:90%
about my near-death experience.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, so I'm doing a
background medical history

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
on myself all the
way back to my birth.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I did X, Y, and Z--

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
hurting my arm, hurting
my leg, breaking my ankle,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
whatever my early
childhood memories

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:90%
were of medical issues.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.812 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, kind of
this open-ended question--

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:84%
do you remember anything
else that I need

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:90%
to put on my medical record?

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:90%
We had dinner.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
We were having a great
time with my husband

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and my family and his family.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of
the dinner, he came to me,

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and he kind of
came really close,

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Barb,
there's something

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
I need to apologize to you for.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I should have told you
something years ago,

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and every time I ever
thought about telling you,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:90%
it just wasn't the right time.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
When you were 18
months old, you died.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't believe
that he said that.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And my husband was
just astonished, too.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, when
you were 18 months old,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:84%
you got a very high fever,
and you were really sick.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't
remember what you had.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:90%
He said, I was 12.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
My mom was pregnant with our
youngest child, their youngest

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
child, which is
my little sister.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, what happened was that
I was very ill with a fever,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and I went into convulsions,
and I stopped breathing.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The fire department
told my father

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to tell my mom to put
me into a tepid bath,

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
so draw the water with
just not hot or cold,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and submerse me up to
my neck in that water,

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and then to slowly add ice cubes
to the water to slowly lower

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
my body temperature.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
They were sending
the ambulance over,

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted her
to do this first

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:90%
before the ambulance got there.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So my mom was in the bathroom,
and unfortunately, in 1958, we

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:90%
just had one tray of ice cubes.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So that was brought
from the freezer,

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but my mom then sent
my two brothers, the 10

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and the 12-year-old, off
to the neighbors' houses

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
to gather ice from
the neighbors,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and emergency-- run,
run, go get this ice.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
When he came back, he
stood in the doorway,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:84%
handed my mom the ice, and stood
in the doorway of the bathroom,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and he said, he looked at me,
and my mom was sobbing over me.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
were soft purple.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, my mom had been
adding the ice to the water,

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
he said I came alive

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
again by arching my back
and taking in a deep breath.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he said I turned
bright red immediately

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:84%
when I did that, and he
said I started crying.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And the ambulance tech people
came into the bathroom.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:84%
They stabilized me,
wrapped me up, and then

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:90%
took me off into the ambulance.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So my mom and dad are calling
for the nanny to come upstairs,

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and my sister came
running up the stairs

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and said, why did Barbie
have a temper tantrum?

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.132 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was leaving out
the door with my father,

00:23:07.132 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
had grabbed her
purse and was going

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to follow the ambulance
to the hospital.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And she stopped and
said, why would you

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
say that Barbie was
having a temper tantrum?

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was upset
by what my sister said.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, that's
what Mrs. Oates said

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to me, that Barbie was upstairs
having a temper tantrum.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:10%
So my parents rushed off to
the hospital, and I came home,

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:10%
my brother thinks, four
or five days later.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So I have both my brother's
and my sister's memories

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
of the incident.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- and all
of the after effects

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
were very apparent
through my early childhood

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and were rather
upsetting to my mom

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
at times, because one of
the major after effects

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:90%
is intuition.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen
would be things

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
like my mom holding my hand,
and I'm five years old,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're standing
on a street corner.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in downtown Salem,
Oregon, where I was raised,

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
I'm hiding my face.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And my mom says,
what are you doing?

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:10%
Why are you acting like that?

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:10%
I said to her, there's
going to be two cars that

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:10%
are going to crash together.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And right after I
said that to her,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
two cars crashed in
the intersection right

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:90%
in front of us.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And my mom, alarmed and
upset by just me having

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
said that just
before it happened,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
kind of grabbed me and
said, don't tell anyone

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:90%
that you can do that.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell anyone that
you're able to do that.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that
a lot from my mom,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
actually, because there were
a lot of variety of things

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that I would do that
were upsetting to her.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
she understood,

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think there was much
information about those types

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of activities.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think she thought
it was negative,

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and she told me not to do
it and not to talk about it.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So the many incidents
that occurred

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
happened even up through junior
high age and my high school

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
There were incidents where
my friends would actually

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.610 align:middle line:84%
question me as to how I
could have possibly known

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that something was
going to happen.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It alarmed them, and,
in fact, in high school,

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I had three or four friends that
I had an incident occur right

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
in front of them, where I told
them what was going to happen,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and it happened.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that
it was something

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
like I was a witch or
something, and they

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:90%
were really upset by it.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
to explain it either,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.865 align:middle line:84%
and I just really
got upset with them

00:25:46.865 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and said they couldn't
call me a witch.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't acceptable,
and I wouldn't allow that.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So many years and many
intuition moments have passed,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and I recognize now
that it's a benefit

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that I have the
intuition, and I actually

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
welcome it and enjoy it.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
And I use it really well.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not a medium.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't have people pay me
for it or anything like that.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it's just
beneficial for my life

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
when I get messages that happen
that save my life sometimes

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and other incidents that
occur where it helps me

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:90%
with what I'm doing.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
When my grandfather died,
it was my father's father.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
My mom received
the telephone call,

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and I came running from my
room, hearing my mom's sobs.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:84%
She said that my
grandfather had died.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So the reaction that my older
sister and my younger sister

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:90%
had was to burst into tears.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was about nine
years old, and I

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
remember thinking this
happy, absolute effervescence

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
came into my soul
at that moment.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, boy,
he gets to go home.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And my mom said, why
aren't you crying?

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Didn't you love grandpa?

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, in
that moment, that I

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
had behaved in a different
way than my siblings.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I then said, yes, I loved
grandpa, and I started crying.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I forced myself to cry, but
that wasn't my natural reaction

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And that made me feel
weird at the time,

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
understand that at all.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
In high school, I had
a very good friend

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
who was very ill
with kidney issues.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up dying at
age 21, and we had a lot

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:90%
of conversations about death.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I talked with him a lot about
that, because he knew he was--

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
there was a limit to his life,
because his kidneys were dying.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had a lot of
conversations about that.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
the only person

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that he felt comfortable with
talking about that, and even

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:84%
as a high school person and
in my early college years,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.370 align:middle line:84%
there was a difference
in what I understood

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and what I could draw from, even
though no one had contributed

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go to church.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have
parents that talked

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:90%
about that type of stuff.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing being
inserted into my life.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So when I realized that I
had the near-death experience

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
at age 31, I still didn't know
about the near-death experience

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I had when I was young.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But it really changed
my viewpoint on death,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and it really allowed me
to see that if I continued

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:84%
past the point of
my body's death,

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
if I was up on the
ceiling, if I--

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:84%
who I was, all of me, who I am,
all of my thoughts and feelings

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:84%
were up on the ceiling, then
when I looked down at my body,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.500 align:middle line:84%
it was no different than looking
at a wetsuit I had just shed.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Who I was was up on the ceiling.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:10%
So when other people died in
my life, as people passed,

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.270 align:middle line:10%
I realized that they continued
beyond the point of death.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:10%
And it really lessened my grief.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I would miss them.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I would miss their time in
my life and my interactions

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But I also felt as
though, even though they

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:middle line:84%
were gone, that I still had
a relationship with them--

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:84%
not that I could
hear them or see them

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or anything like
that, but that I

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
felt that their
consciousness still existed

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and that if I sent them
love and told them I

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:84%
still thought of them and that
I saw a particular thing that

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.400 align:middle line:84%
reminded me of them, that
they would know that.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And they would know that
I was sending my love

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:90%
across the veil to them.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:10%
So it's been a very
different life,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:10%
understanding that from
pretty much in my early 30s

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:10%
and beyond that,
I actually believe

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:10%
that I had pieces of
that understanding

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:10%
all through my early
childhood, because that's

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:10%
why I reacted the way that I
did when my grandfather died.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:90%
So for me, it's a huge gift.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It is an amazing gift to
know that death doesn't

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
hold anything over me, that
when people pass away, that they

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:90%
still continue to exist.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Their consciousness
survives death

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and that I will, again, see
them when I end this life,

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:84%
whenever this particular
life goes and ends,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that I'll then be in
that level with them.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The other side is what I call
it, and I'll see them again.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're part of the
greater consciousness,

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know the
whole idea of everything

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:90%
behind all of that.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm still learning as I go
along, what I want to believe

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and what I feel
resonates with me.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that I
don't feel that death

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:90%
has any hold on any of us.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe we just
shed those bodies.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way you
look at people, too.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way
that you accept people,

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and it changes the way
that you view the world,

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because if you view each
person, instead of their body

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:84%
being who they are, if you view
them as their soul instead,

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
then you overlook
height differences,

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:84%
weight differences,
color, religion, anything.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It totally changes the
outlook of each person

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:90%
is just another soul.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
beyond the exterior,

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and you look for
who they are, it's

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%
just-- it's way more
beautiful to find

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:84%
who they are inside
rather than just seeing

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
the outside of the person
and judging on that.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's been a
lifelong thing that I've

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:84%
been practicing and working
at to get better at.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's really improved
my life amazingly

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.977 align:middle line:90%
to have that viewpoint.

00:32:50.977 --> 00:32:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
The first time that
I went to a medium

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
was because a friend of
mine at the university

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.590 align:middle line:84%
had a person that
she knew that was--

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that she had gone
to that she felt

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:84%
was just a pretty
amazing person.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So this friend of mine said,
you should really try this.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:90%
You should really go.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never had anybody that
I knew that had gone to one,

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'd never gone.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So my friend encouraged me, and
I decided to go ahead and go.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And the minute that she saw me--

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know her at all.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I'd never met her--

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
she proceeded to
give me a reading.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things she said was,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.540 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
your own business.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You're going to create
your own business.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.858 align:middle line:90%
I see it being very successful.

00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was
working at the university,

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, I'll never
leave the university.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the best
job I've ever had.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I love it, and my
husband works there,

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're so much a
part of the university.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no way
that I would leave.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So some years passed,
probably about six.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I was in my living
room one morning,

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up hearing
a voice and feeling

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:90%
a grip on the top of my head.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this
voice that said,

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.810 align:middle line:90%
you will have a scrapbook store.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:90%
It was this big, deep voice.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.212 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally alarmed, and
I didn't know what to think.

00:34:24.212 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was alone in
the living room.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.837 align:middle line:90%
It was early in the morning.

00:34:26.837 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:90%
I had just woken my son up.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:90%
And I looked up at the ceiling.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't know
what you're talking

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to me for about a
scrapbook store,

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
scrapbook, and I don't

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:90%
know what you're talking about.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.489 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to do that.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And do you have the
wrong house or something?

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of made a joke out of
it, and nothing else happened.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So I went running
through the house,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
and I went to my
husband, and he knows

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:90%
I have really strong intuition.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
He's watched it a million times
happen and all sorts of things.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.233 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
this just happened,

00:34:59.233 --> 00:35:00.400 align:middle line:90%
and I just heard this voice.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.108 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this
feeling and this grip

00:35:02.108 --> 00:35:03.952 align:middle line:84%
on the top of my
head, and I heard

00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:05.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to
start a scrapbook store.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And my husband looked
at me and said,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:84%
well, I think that if you
heard that big of a message,

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that you should
consider what it's

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.375 align:middle line:90%
going to take to create that.

00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at my husband.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to start
a scrapbook store.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.400 align:middle line:90%
I work at the university.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm staying there.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I spent the entire
morning that morning

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:84%
just talking to the other
side in my head saying,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.360 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't know why you
were talking to me about that.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I got to the downtown
area of Santa Barbara

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:84%
after lunch that day,
and I was driving home.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Another voice in
the car said, you

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:84%
need to stop and ask
about a business loan.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
businesslike man's voice.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And I questioned, and I
said, who are you people?

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Why are you talking
to me about this?

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And so my bank was only one
block further than that.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I ended up deciding
to pull into the bank,

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of talked
to the other side

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and said, look, if this
is what you want me to do,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to do it.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:90%
But I don't see the point of it.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
go into the bank,

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'll ask about a business
loan, but I really don't--

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
why I'm doing this.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the bank, and
I sat before a banking officer.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, so I'm
interested in opening up

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.840 align:middle line:90%
a scrapbook store.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.230 align:middle line:10%
And he said, how much
do you want to borrow?

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The absurdity of what
I was doing kind of

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
struck me as funny at
that moment, and I said,

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.697 align:middle line:84%
How much do you think
it's going to take

00:36:34.697 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%
to start a scrapbook store?

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.550 align:middle line:84%
His face reflected
that he thought

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I was just wasting
his time, and I said,

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm really sorry that
I've come to talk to you.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I've
jumped the gun,

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and I should probably approach
the bank at a later time.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for your time,

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted
to get out of there.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.680 align:middle line:84%
As I was walking through the
bank, the voice from the car

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.890 align:middle line:90%
said, now, wait a minute.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:90%
You can't give up that easily.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.480 align:middle line:84%
You need to go back
and ask someone else.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
bank, I said to the voice

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.240 align:middle line:84%
that I could hear in my head,
well, if I can hear you,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:84%
then you can probably
hear my thoughts,

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're not making
this easy for me.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
You need to show me who
it is I need to talk to.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up happening
was as I was walking out

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
of the bank towards my
car, this man looked at me,

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and he raised his hand
up, and he waved to me,

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and he smiled at me, and
I'd never seen him before.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I came today
to talk about a loan,

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
but I realize I've
jumped the gun,

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and I actually
need to figure out

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:90%
how to create a business plan.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And the other man
that I talked to

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:84%
said that I needed to
do a business plan.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So he ended up talking to
me for about 10 minutes

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.600 align:middle line:90%
about what a business plan was.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, can you
hold on for just a moment?

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.800 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And he went two cubicles down.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.040 align:middle line:90%
They were glass-walled cubicles.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.270 align:middle line:90%
He was talking with a woman.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.860 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
at the computer,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and when he came back about
four minutes later, he said,

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Bartolome, you've been
approved for a $250,000 loan

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.395 align:middle line:90%
to start your scrapbook store.

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you and your husband want
to come in tomorrow and sign

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.600 align:middle line:90%
paperwork for that?

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can imagine that
that was a pretty big shock,

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't even wanted
to really do the store.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And to be just told like that,
but now you've got the money,

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to do
it, it was pretty amazing.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I actually built the
store in three months,

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.682 align:middle line:84%
and it was called Santa
Barbara Scrapbooks,

00:38:41.682 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and it was in Santa Barbara,
California where I live.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up being
a very popular place,

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and I had it for six
years before the 2008

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.430 align:middle line:84%
crunch with the recession really
took the wind out of its sails.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that it
was important for me

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:90%
to move on to do something else.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And three months after
I opened the store,

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I was named Businesswoman of
the Year for Santa Barbara.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.862 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- part
of the reason why

00:39:11.862 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to talk about
my near-death experience,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:19.260 align:middle line:84%
because it seemed really scary
to be named Businesswoman

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Year for this
beautiful community,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and then turn around
a few years later

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and end up being told
that I need to talk

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:84%
about my near-death
experience and that I need

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to open an IANDS
group in Santa Barbara

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and have this possibility of
having all of these people

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
see me as someone
different than what

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I had been when I was named
Businesswoman of the Year.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a big, scary thing
to do, but for me, it

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:84%
was very powerful, because it's
the truth of what I'm saying.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the total truth.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make this stuff up.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It was such a
life-changing event,

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and it all unfolded
in such an amazing way

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:84%
from that medium
that spoke to me.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I ended up finding the tape
that she had done years later

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:90%
after I'd started my store.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I think probably two or three
years into having my store,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I happened to come
across the tape

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that she had given me of
that, and I thought, well,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I should listen to this.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I was in
shock, and I said, oh, my gosh.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I showed it to my husband
and had him listen to it.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, she predicted I was
going to have my own business.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.610 align:middle line:84%
She said that I was going
to have my own business,

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and I totally
didn't believe her.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And I discredited it
immediately and thought,

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that couldn't possibly be.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that if
a medium has the capacity

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the
other side, I think

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.830 align:middle line:84%
there could be people that maybe
don't have the capacity that

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:84%
are pretending that
they are mediums,

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and then I think there's an
amazing group of people that

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
do decide that this is
going to be their life,

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are going to
give messages to people

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and help them.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I know that I get talked
to from the other side, so

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.810 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't anybody else that
are doing that for their work

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:84%
be able to open up
that communication

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.410 align:middle line:84%
from the other side and hear
from either their spirit

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:20.130 align:middle line:84%
guides or God or whoever
it is they think is there?

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Someone's there,
because, obviously, I've

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:90%
been hearing it, too.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's an
amazing experience,

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and I don't go to
mediums regularly.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a lot of
friends that are mediums now,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of mediums
are near-death experiencers.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And Terry Yoder is one of them,
and he's a good friend now.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that
there's this opening that

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:84%
occurs when someone has a
near-death experience that

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.200 align:middle line:84%
allows them to have this
one foot in one side and one

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:84%
foot in the other side capacity
of hearing from the other side

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and giving those
messages to people.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to make it
a business, such as what

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Terry has done.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's given me
amazing, amazing experiences

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:84%
in my life, saved my
life a number of times,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and incredible
things have happened.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's wonderful.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:10%
I think mediums are wonderful,
and if they're capable,

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.845 align:middle line:10%
and they're hearing, and they're
able to give people messages,

00:42:23.845 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:10%
I think that's great.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I also
find that works in my life

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.890 align:middle line:84%
is the concept of optimism
and thinking positively

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and the law of attraction,
where if you're

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.990 align:middle line:84%
thinking about something
that you really want to do,

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:84%
then you maybe write it
down, and you think about it

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.950 align:middle line:84%
before you go to bed,
and you see yourself

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.470 align:middle line:90%
in that experience.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's say that I did have
the idea of creating a store,

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:84%
or I did have the idea
of traveling to Italy.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So what I do with my
thoughts is I envision,

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
wholly, that experience
happening to me.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So if it was, let's say, a trip,
I spend time in my off hours--

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.220 align:middle line:90%
say it's a trip to Italy--

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:84%
looking at photographs
of the different

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.270 align:middle line:90%
places that I would want to go.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I read about it, and I
think strongly about being there

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and what I would
do if I was there.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm going on a trip,
and I visualize the pictures,

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and I find out
about the location,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.320 align:middle line:84%
then I believe
that it'll happen.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a
sudden, something

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.190 align:middle line:84%
will happen where either an
amount of money comes to me,

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.610 align:middle line:84%
or my husband says,
for our anniversary,

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I got two tickets for Italy.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And something happens.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that idea worked
really well when

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I went through
the divorce that I

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:84%
had to go through after my
near-death experience at age

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.190 align:middle line:90%
31.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:17.240 align:middle line:84%
When I was 34, I divorced,
and for two years,

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I envisioned the type of person
that I would want in my life,

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:84%
because the previous person
had been so traumatic.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And so what I would
do is as I was going

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.140 align:middle line:84%
through my life each day, in all
the different contacts that I

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
had with people, whether
it be at a grocery store

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:84%
or at a restaurant or at my
work or friends and people

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that I knew, I would look
for characteristics in them

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that I felt were
positive and that I

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:84%
would want in someone that I
would want attached in my life.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And so at night,
before I went to sleep,

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.110 align:middle line:84%
after I'd put my
children to bed,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I would think about
those characteristics,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and I would write
them into a book.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So after two years, I had
206 things written down.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up meeting
my current husband

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
through my children, through
my older child, met his older

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.620 align:middle line:90%
child, and they became friends.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up meeting,
and as I dated him,

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I was able to look at
that spiral-bound notebook

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that I had written
all those things into.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And if he was the person I
had been listing all along,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and I find that after
24 years of marriage,

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.850 align:middle line:90%
my husband is that list.

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.800 align:middle line:90%
And he was absolutely that list.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it, for me,
is really amazing,

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and it tells me that
anyone can do that.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a
bad situation, let's

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.170 align:middle line:84%
say, with a marriage or
a workplace or anything

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that you've got
going, envisioning

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.440 align:middle line:84%
what you want it to be
instead of what it is,

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:90%
I think there's power in that.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it can
change the outcome of what

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.330 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe our
minds have that capacity,

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
a lot of research

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.980 align:middle line:84%
now along the lines
of that, and they're

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.920 align:middle line:84%
finding that that's
exactly what the case is

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
is that you can actually--
there's a number of research

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.150 align:middle line:84%
studies that have been
done, where they actually

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
were able to detect that
the person's mind was making

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the change to the object that
was not even present where they

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:34.790 align:middle line:84%
were at, so being able to
visualize things from afar

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and being able to make
changes to things from afar

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that not even close to where
you are is actually a capacity

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.150 align:middle line:90%
that our minds have.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So I would encourage
people to use that

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and to study about that
and use that in their life,

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.865 align:middle line:84%
because, for me, it's
been a big difference.

00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It really has helped.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I very much think
there's an awakening

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:84%
amongst the people that have
had near-death experiences,

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and they actually are
doing research now

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:84%
about people who haven't had a
near-death experience, but are

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.100 align:middle line:84%
exposed to the stories,
whether reading them

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.630 align:middle line:90%
or watching videos.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And they've actually
got a research study

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that showed that
those people that

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:84%
are hearing the stories
about near-death experiences

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:84%
are diminishing their fear of
death and the degree of grief

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that they feel when someone
passes away, because it gives

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.070 align:middle line:84%
them the understanding that the
consciousness survives death.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So that is a huge benefit
for the near-death experience

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:45.360 align:middle line:84%
stories to be out there
in the world, and I'm--

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:84%
with me, it's
personally affected me,

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:51.000 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really happy to know
that giving my story, when

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I talk to different IANDS
groups across the United States

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.940 align:middle line:84%
or I'm interviewed
for YouTube videos,

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.880 align:middle line:84%
that this is a gift I
can give out to people

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and help other people
understand that life continues

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.710 align:middle line:84%
past the point of
death, that who you are

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is not the physical life that
you're experiencing right now.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You are a spiritual being
having a physical experience,

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.760 align:middle line:84%
not a physical being having
a spiritual experience.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get to that
point, where we can understand

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're all spiritual
beings and that we're here

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to learn and grow and to love
and to care for other people,

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to be kind, to make the
world a better place,

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.530 align:middle line:90%
then that's my message.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:41.480 align:middle line:90%
