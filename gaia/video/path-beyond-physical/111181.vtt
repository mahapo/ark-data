Because of the

and pioneers of
consciousness, we

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
believe that we are

more than our physical body.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time
to stop believing

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:84%

is beyond the physical.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:90%

I can change the dial, and it'll
be a country music station.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
There somebody somewhere
who's playing country music.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I can change it again,
and I can get pop music.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:10%
I don't see those
other dimensions,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
but when I tune into them,
when I direct my perception,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:10%
then those worlds become real.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:10%
They come to life.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:10%
Where are they?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

They're being
broadcast everywhere.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's not very much
of a stretch of imagination

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.105 align:middle line:84%
to think that it isn't
limited to radio and TV,

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that there are other worlds that
are happening simultaneously

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So then it becomes a question
of, how do we tune into them?

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
How do we shift
our perception so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that we can begin to interact
with them in a meaningful way?

Robert Monroe was a pioneer
in this type of exploration.

of human consciousness.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1958, Monroe coined the
term "out-of-body experience"

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
as he began experiencing a
state of consciousness separate

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and apart from
his physical body.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:10%
>>Most people would recognize
as a classic out-of-body

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:10%
experience is when
you believe yourself

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:10%
to be separate from the
body, and that belief

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:10%
is reinforced very strongly
because you look back

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:10%
and see your body.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Now this happens in near death
experiences, in surgery cases,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
or in automobile
cases where people

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
have a very definite
experience of saying,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
"I am separate from my
body because look there's

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:90%
my body right down there."

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
That was the kind of classic
out-of-body experience

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:90%
that Bob Monroe first had.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
One night he felt himself
bouncing or hitting

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
something hard and
flat, and he thought

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
it might be the sheets of his
bed or the covers of his bed.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to
be the ceiling itself,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.038 align:middle line:84%
because it was
rough and textured.

00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:29.246 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that there
was a fountain next to him,

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't
figure out why there

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:90%
was a fountain in his bed.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be
the chandelier hanging

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:90%
over the bed.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And when he looked down, there
was this strange man in bed

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
with his wife, and
couldn't figure out

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
what was going on until
he realized that was him

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:90%
down there in the bed.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was quite panicked
about-- this is dying.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying now.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.839 align:middle line:84%
So he tried very hard and he
pulled himself through the air,

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:90%
swimming through the air.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And finally fit himself like
a glove back into his body

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and sat up in bed quite startled
and panicked and worried

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:90%
about this whole thing.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:10%
>>So in the beginning,
he was quite convinced

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:10%
that he was dying.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And he went through
numerous medical tests

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:10%
and even psychological tests
to see if he was crazy or not.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And all the tests proved that he
was in relatively good health,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and he was pretty sane.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to
remember, in the 1950s,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
this was a time when
nobody was talking

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
about that kind of experience.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no such thing
as the new age movement.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't part of
our vocabulary.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And so he was in the unfortunate
position, or maybe fortunate

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
for us, of really having
to go it alone and find out

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
for himself what
this was all about.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>During this period
of time, he was

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
part of the social
world of New York.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
He was a young man, college
graduate, looking for a job,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and found himself in New
York in the radio industry.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, he was a producer
of a very famous radio

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:90%
program called "The Shadow."

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.417 align:middle line:84%
Many people from my
generation and before

00:07:06.417 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:84%
remember that very
well because it was

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.260 align:middle line:90%
a nationally broadcast series.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
There were things
happening in his life

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that he simply
didn't understand,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and that he needed to
find some way of bringing

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
some kind of better awareness
to what was going on.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>After visiting doctors, going
to different religious leaders,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
what had happened to him,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
they talked about an Eastern
tradition of going out of body.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Monroe, if you really
want to know more about this,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
you should go to the Far
East and talk to the masters,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
because they seem to know
something about this.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't want to do that.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
He was a businessman
in New York, the vice

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:90%
president of NBC Radio.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't do that.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Once he began to get some
assurances that perhaps

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
his wellbeing was
not in jeopardy,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:84%
he started to get
really curious about it.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:84%
The fear started to drop
away and curiosity kicked in.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>He began to experiment.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Practicing in bed at night, he
would feel a sense of vibration

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
or a sense of becoming
puffy, larger,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and then reducing to size.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And then this vibration
would cease at some point.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And he found that via what
he called a second body,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
he would reach over
and try reaching down

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:84%
through the floor, and
then he would reach up

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.703 align:middle line:90%
through the ceiling.

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, got brave
enough to walk outside and then

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
come back in to make sure
he could still come back.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, would
go to his neighbors,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and then come back real quick.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And after time, he
began to venture further

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and found that this whole
local world that we know it

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is really pretty
boring in comparison

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.385 align:middle line:84%
to all the places
in the universe

00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
that he could discover
in this state.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>As Monroe was exploring
these other dimensions

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, he began
to journal his experiences.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Several years after
he started journaling,

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Bob Monroe had fallen
ill and needed surgery

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
on his carotid arteries,
which at the time

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
was considered a
very risky procedure.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
In order to keep his
journaling preserved,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
he gave his manuscript
to a good friend of his

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
in an effort to make sure
his journaling was kept safe.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, he came out of
surgery and he recovered,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and weeks and months rolled by.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And got in contact with
his friend and said,

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:84%
well, I'd like to get
my transcript back.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I seem to be healed up now, and
I'd like to continue my work.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, Mr. Monroe,
this is such a fantastic work,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I've given it to a
publisher to look at,

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and they'd like to
publish a book on this.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, Bob was torn.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Here he was, part of New York
society, being very proper

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and doing all the right
things to work his way up

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.392 align:middle line:84%
through New York society,
sort of worried about,

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want
this to get out.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.780 align:middle line:90%
This is my secret life.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:84%
This is something
else I'm doing.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there was like, a book?

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Somebody wants to
publish a book?

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, that'd be kind of nice
if somebody published a book.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if they published
a book, others would read it,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and they could help me find
out, what's this all about?

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
What's this grand
adventure I'm on?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe others have
had this adventure,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a book would
be a good way to do that.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.759 align:middle line:84%
And then the other part
would come back and say,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I might lose my job if
they found out about this.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1971, Robert Monroe's
journaled accounts

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
were published in
his first book called

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:90%
"Journeys Out Of The Body."

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
book of its kind

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and brought a subject that
wasn't being talked about much

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
into the mainstream,
allowing others

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to come forth to share
their paranormal stories

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and out-of-body experiences.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>I remember him telling
me one time very vividly

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:84%
about he had been invited to
a cocktail party with his boss

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were standing
around in a high rise

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
apartment in New York, all
with their cocktail glasses.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.967 align:middle line:84%
And his boss said, hey
Bob, come over here.

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you about
that book you wrote.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And he thought, oh, no.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:90%
This is the end.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:90%
NBC's going to fire me.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
all over for me.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.641 align:middle line:84%
And his boss said, my wife
has this happen to her

00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and she thinks
this is just the greatest

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:90%
book she's ever read.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Wanted to thank you for that.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he was like,
that was the first time

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.615 align:middle line:84%
at which he had a sense of
relief that, this is OK.

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It's really OK.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
ostracized or I'm not

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be locked up as being
crazy, that this is really OK.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Throughout the next
20 years, Robert Monroe

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:84%
continued to explore,
research, and teach others

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
about expanded states
of human consciousness

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and practical methods of
enhancing human potential.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:10%
He later wrote two more
books titled "Far Journeys"

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:10%
and "Ultimate Journey,"
which expanded

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:10%
upon his investigations
and research

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:10%
of nonphysical realities
and the limits of what

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:10%
lies beyond the physical world.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>When Bob left
the New York scene,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
he first moved to
Richmond, Virginia

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and spent some time
in Richmond doing

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of
businesses, trying

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
to find an interesting
business to do now

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
that he had made his
millions in New York

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and moved to a quieter
lifestyle in Richmond.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Then he met and
married his wife Nancy,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and they moved out to the
Virginia countryside into place

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
called Whistlefield Farms, which
is about 10 miles from where

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:90%
we are right now.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
He sought the help of
people from the University

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:90%
of Virginia.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:84%
He sought the help of
friends and associates

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that he met or would
be referred to them.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.154 align:middle line:84%
One was a very
interesting physicist

00:12:58.154 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Tom Campbell.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Tom is the TC
physicist described in

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Bob Monroe's second
book, "Far Journeys"

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and has been a serious explorer
of the frontiers of reality,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
mind, consciousness,
and psychic phenomena

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.320 align:middle line:90%
since the early 1970s.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>>I took a job, and my boss
tossed Bob Monroe's book,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:10%
"Journeys Out Of The Body."

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:10%
And because I was
a physicist, he

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:10%
wanted to know--
physicists study reality.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to know what
I thought about it.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's very interesting,

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:90%
but how do you know it's true?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this guy's just making
this stuff up to sell books.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
About a month or so later
the boss comes back and says,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:90%
we know where Bob lives.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.234 align:middle line:90%
He lives not far away.

00:13:46.234 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go visit him.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to come?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Of course I did.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Found Bob to be a
very credible person.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You can generally tell
when people trying to make

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.747 align:middle line:84%
impressions or put
something over on you,

00:13:57.747 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and he was just very open.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Very affable, kind of nice guy.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
He was wealthy in his own
right, so he wasn't trying

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:90%
to make money on his books.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
He made 100 times what
those books made in his job.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So that wasn't
obviously his point.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And the more I talked
with him, the more

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I realized that what
Bob really wanted more

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:84%
than anything was
to make himself,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:90%
his experience legitimate.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to understand it.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to turn
out-of-body into science,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:90%
something repeatable.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:90%
That was a dream of his.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So he had built this lab.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%
And the lab was empty.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It was just basically
an empty building.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking for
some scientific talent,

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
some credentials to help
put the lab together.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So he asked the group of us--
where I worked at the time

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
was full of engineers
and scientists.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.341 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of asked us.

00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:49.715 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you guys are
all scientists and engineers.

00:14:49.715 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm building this lab.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Any of you want to
work there, want

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to help me put it together?

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Boy, my hand shot up
in the air instantly,

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and another guy's did as well.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>That other person
was Dennis Mennerich.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
With a background in
electrical engineering,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Dennis would be a
perfect contrast

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:90%
to Tom's knowledge of physics.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Together they began
building Bob Monroe's lab.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
As construction progressed,
Bob would teach Tom and Dennis

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
his techniques of
going out-of-body.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>The deal we made
with Bob was that we

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
would help him put
his lab together,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and we would make
sure that things

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:84%
were done according
to good protocols,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.756 align:middle line:84%
that the results
would be believable.

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And we would help him build his
equipment, his things he needed

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to measure what was going on.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.295 align:middle line:84%
And that he would help us
learn what he knew how to do.

00:15:34.295 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
He would help us
learn the out-of-body,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:84%
how to master altered states
and that sort of thing.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And he agreed.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So for the next five
to maybe eight years--

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
this was probably about
1972-- up to about 1980,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
we'd go out to the
lab, we'd spend an hour

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or two building equipment,
wiring things, soldering,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
making GSRs to measure
galvanic skin response.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
We got an old EEG
for brain waves.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:10%
We did some high impedance
input volt meters

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.419 align:middle line:10%
for changing the voltage on
the skin and around the head.

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Just anything we could
think of to measure.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
We really didn't know what
might be useful to measure.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So we just measured
everything that we could.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards
Bob would come up,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and Dennis Mennerich and
I would get in the booths.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And he would teach
us, at least try

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.634 align:middle line:84%
to guide us to having those
experiences and altered states.

00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, he
had some background

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
sounds that he played, but they
were mostly just pink noise.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.024 align:middle line:10%
And the pink noise was
supposed to just help

00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:10%
kind of settle your mind
and let you not think

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:10%
about anything in particular.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:10%
>>Bob Monroe had suspicions
that this pink noise,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:10%
if enhanced somehow,
could possibly

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:10%
help others go out of body.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Bob looked through the past
experiences in his life

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
for the key element
that possibly

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
caused his out-of-body
experiences to come so easily.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>And he talks about
being in DC-3 aircraft,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
a very old and yet very
reliable aircraft, which

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:90%
had two propellers.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And the pilots were
trained very carefully

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to adjust the pitch
of the propellers

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and the RPMs of the
engine correctly.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Else, if they were slightly
out of tune with one another,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.827 align:middle line:84%
the pilots would
be exposed to a--

00:17:18.827 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
[WHIRRING]

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:84%
--sound as the two engines
had this beat frequency

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%
oscillation.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And they had had accidents
with the pilots falling asleep.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they said,
you must make sure,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
do not let that sound
come through your engines.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Adjust the RPMs and
the pitch of the props

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:90%
so that that doesn't happen.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So he remembered that
as a sound concept

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
in its ability to help
people to go to sleep.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he remembers riding
on the train from Westchester

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
County into the city to his
job, where he would watch people

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
nod off in the morning
to sleep and noticed

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.322 align:middle line:84%
that the sound of
the train-- chu

00:18:01.322 --> 00:18:03.576 align:middle line:84%
chu chu chu, chu chu
chu chu, chu chu chu

00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:84%
chu-- to go across the tracks
seemed to rhythmically cause

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%
people to go to sleep.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:10%
>>I don't think that you
could go to Bob Monroe's house

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.685 align:middle line:10%
and have a normal cocktail hour.

00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:10%
Because as soon as
you would get there,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:10%
within a few minutes instead of
a beer or something like that,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:10%
he'd lead you into a room
and slap a pair of headphones

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:10%
on your head, and turn
the light on and start

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:10%
fiddling with dials and knobs
to see what effect sound might

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:10%
have on your awareness,
and what your reactions

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:10%
might be to that.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So through countless
hours of experimentation,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
he began to realize
that sound could

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:84%
be used to start to
aid and to direct

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of experiences.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, this was a popular
time in which sleep

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:10%
learning was an en
vogue kind of thing.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.625 align:middle line:10%
It was one of those-- today
if we saw it on television

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:10%
it would be $19.95!

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Learn while you sleep! $19.95!

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's a truly
American way to try

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
to get something for nothing.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have
to study and work

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
at it-- if I could learn while
I slept, that'd be a good idea.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So there were a lot
of products out there

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
on the old 33 RPM records that
had your mathematic tables on

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
in foreign language,
lessons on them,

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
different dialogues with
promises that all you had to do

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is play this 33 RPM
record, and you could

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:90%
learn while you were sleeping.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And after a few
years, scientists

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.955 align:middle line:90%
began to look at this.

00:19:29.955 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
All of these salesmen are out
there marketing these things

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:90%
to the naive public.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you really learn
while you're asleep?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists found out
that in stages of sleep-- stage

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
one, stage two, stage
three, stage four,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and REM-- that if you are in
stage one, stage two, this very

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
light stage of sleep, that you
could actually test someone

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
the next morning, and
the multiplication tables

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
were remembered.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Their vocabulary
skills were improved.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But if the person was allowed to
go down to stage three or stage

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:90%
four sleep, it didn't work.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So there was a little
bit of something

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to this concept
of sleep learning,

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
but only if you could
maintain this platform

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
of the early hypnagogic
stages of sleep,

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:84%
not down here in the
unconscious stages of sleep.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So Bob Monroe said,
oh, maybe that

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:90%
would be a good thing to do.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could allow people to
get into this balanced stage

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
where the mind is awake,
but the body is asleep.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.214 align:middle line:84%
And then it began to
develop that, you know,

00:20:44.214 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
this has something to do maybe
with what happened to me.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Here I was developing
all these sounds,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
listening very carefully,
exposing myself

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to all these sounds.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if it carried
over into that night

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
when I was in the bedroom when
I was floating out of my body.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he began to
think that maybe it

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
was the sound
experiments he'd done.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:90%
So he started creating sounds.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Started creating different
sound patterns to experiment

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
with this mind
awake, body asleep.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Through Tom, Dennis, and
Bob's experimentation in the lab

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
measuring the different EEG
brain waves and patterns,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
they found that by placing
different sounds into each ear,

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
they discovered that
four hertz seemed

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.685 align:middle line:84%
to be the right frequency
to elicit this altered state

00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:90%
and out-of-body experience.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Bob had left the lab for a
few weeks, and in his absence,

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Tom and Dennis worked
with EEGs in order

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:84%
to recreate this four
hertz oscillation.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to test
the four hertz theory.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.806 align:middle line:84%
>>We knew that Bob felt this
four hertz oscillation just

00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
before he went
out of body, so we

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
were trying to see if we
couldn't emulate that.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:10%
Dennis and I worked at
it, and Dennis actually

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:10%
is the one that came up
with the Hemi-Sync idea.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:10%
He read it in a "Scientific
American" article.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:10%
He said, let's try this, see
if it doesn't entrain the brain

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:10%
waves.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We wanted a way to entrain
it down to the four hertz.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
We thought if this
EEG was oscillating,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:84%
if you could put almost all your
energy into that four hertz,

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that that might be something
that would be a good idea

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:90%
It was just our intuition.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:90%
We really didn't know either.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And EEG is generally scattered
over lots of frequency bands.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It goes, delta's unconscious.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Theta's like the
meditation state.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.519 align:middle line:84%
Alpha's kind of a
calm, relaxed state.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Then you get the beta,
which is where we are now,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:90%
having a conversation.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:90%
You have all this energy.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.265 align:middle line:84%
When you look at your
brain waves in an EEG,

00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:42.765 align:middle line:84%
they have the little
electrodes that

00:22:42.765 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
are attached all over your
head, they measure this.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we would
have about 80% of our energy

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%
would be in the beta state.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Some would be the alpha, and
some would be in the theta.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Probably none would
be in the delta,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:90%
or very little would be there.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.482 align:middle line:84%
So we found that this
Hemi-Sync, that what it is-- it

00:23:02.482 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:90%
wasn't called Hemi-Sync then.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:90%
That was Bob's name.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:90%
It was just binaural beats.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And that puts a pure
tone in the left ear.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Pure tone-- that's
about four hertz off

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
from the first tone
in the right ear.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And the two tones go
in and actually mix

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
at the corpus callosum, which
is that part of the brain that

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%
separates the two hemispheres.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's where the
cross connects are.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Now what happens is when
those two signals are introduced

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to each ear, there's
a third signal

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that's produced that is the
difference between them.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:90%
100 and 104.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:84%
The difference between them
is four cycles per second.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
At four cycles per
second, then the brain

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
tends to want to
kind of mimic that.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Both of the halves of the
brain start to work together.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>So in that part of the
brain, the one signal

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is actually mixing
with the other signal

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and causing these
oscillations at four hertz.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And it made the EEG, the power
under the curve in the four

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:84%
hertz area, just
jump up tremendously.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So it succeeded,
and it also put us

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
in an altered state
that was just amazing.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the thing that
we were looking for.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>When we're
beginning to explore

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
some of these ranges
of experience or ranges

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
of perception, the funny
thing is that the frequencies,

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
the brain wave frequencies
that we're looking at,

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
are below the
threshold of hearing.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit
difficult if you want

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to use an audio technology,
and you can't hear it.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Bob used
the binaural beats.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking at four
cycles per second-- again,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the difference
between 100 and 104,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:84%
then we're starting to move
down into the delta range.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And even though that's not
something that we hear,

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the brain actually
manufacturers that third signal.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.460 align:middle line:84%
In some ways it's like if
you've ever tuned a guitar.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You get to two strings
almost, very close.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But if they're
not quite in tune,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
there will be sort of a wavering
or a vibrato of a slower

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a very
simplistic explanation

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because in fact, our signals
have many, many layers to them.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.459 align:middle line:84%
And so you won't hear just one
frequency and just one beat.

00:25:11.459 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they
layered, but they're also

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
masked so they're not going
to be distracting to you.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
very, very effective.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>A few weeks later, Bob
Monroe came back to the lab,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and Tom and Dennis
showed him what

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
they were able to emulate with
the four hertz frequency called

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:90%
binaural beats.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:84%
This later became
known as Hemi-Sync,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:84%
a product that launched
Monroe's lab and workshops.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>So he began to develop
these tape programs.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And eventually said, you
know, if I could just

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:84%
get 5,000 people, that
would be a good experiment.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:84%
5,000 people to try
this out and write down

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
reports about what
they experienced.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Then I'd know.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's make this a
grand experience.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll call it the M5000 program.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>He sent out some
flyers then and said,

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.496 align:middle line:84%
hey, we've got this
new technology,

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and we'd like to experiment
with some people.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Anybody interested?

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.023 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of people
that were interested.

00:26:09.023 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:90%
We wired a motel.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Bob was in the cable business,
so he got his cable truck out

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And we wired a motel, and
we got all this stuff going.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
incredible weekend.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Lots and lots of people were
popped out of their bodies,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.820 align:middle line:90%
were doing things, going places.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And word got around.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, instead
of doing research,

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:90%
we were trainers.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:84%
That just happens that way
because so many people wanted

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.645 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:26:34.645 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it wasn't
but a couple of years

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that we surpassed
that 5,000 number.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And now we do about 1,000 people
a year through the Institute

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>It got to where, like, every
weekend or every other weekend,

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.737 align:middle line:84%
there was a line of people
that all wanted the experience.

00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
That kind of started
to take over our lives.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So Dennis and I,
both after a bit,

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
after other people
were trained to do it

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and other people could
do it, we backed out.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
After that, Bob put me on
the board of directors,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and I would come
back occasionally

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:90%
when they had meetings.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But basically, The Monroe
Institute and I kind of

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:90%
went our own ways after that.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>In Bob's curiosity,
in Bob's investigation

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
happened to him,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:84%
created initially
this whole idea

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that has grown decades
later into what we have now

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:90%
as The Monroe Institute.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1995 at the age of 80,
and after decades of research,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Robert Monroe would make
his final transition

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:90%
into the nonphysical.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Soon after Bob
died, he and I met.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:90%
You know, I went up to meet him.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:84%
He came once or
twice to meet me.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.395 align:middle line:84%
And we had a little
conversation.

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:90%
It was very pleasant.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It was more of a goodbye
than anything else.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then Bob went
off on his own way.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while I still
kind of tap into that energy.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you can still tap
into that same energy,

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and you can get his
opinion, if you'd like.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.009 align:middle line:84%
Because like I say, those
models are very accurate.

00:28:01.009 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:90%
It really is his opinion.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the opinion he would
have had when he was here.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So I visit Bob in
that sense some.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.862 align:middle line:84%
And I occasionally will touch
the energy as it is now.

00:28:12.862 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:90%
But Bob's moved on.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:90%
He's doing something else now.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.740 align:middle line:84%
We kind of got together for
a goodbye and congratulations

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and a so long, sort of thing.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Bob's daughter, Laurie Monroe,
continued her father's research

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness and
the mind's potential

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:90%
until her death in 2006.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The Monroe Institute
was going to need

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
a new leader, a captain,
someone who could

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:90%
steer the ship into the future.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.298 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:44.298 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Skip Atwater was immediately
appointed acting director

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:84%
after Laurie's death and
would later become president.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Skip, who had started
in 1988 at The Institute

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.330 align:middle line:84%
as the lab director,
recalls how he first

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
met Bob Monroe in
the late 1970s,

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
working for the US government
as a counterintelligence

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:90%
specialist in the army.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
His job was detecting and
preventing enemy spy activity.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:10%
>>And the idea is we would go
to different United States,

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:10%
US military facilities' research
and development programs,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:10%
and pretend we were a
foreign intelligence service

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:10%
and attack them, trying
to get as much information

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:10%
as we could about them,
mimicking a threat

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:10%
so that we could
show the commander,

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.500 align:middle line:10%
this is what your picture
looks like to the enemy.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was a chance
for that commander

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:84%
then to adjust his
security posture

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
based on the service we
were providing to him.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:84%
One very fateful day in
Redstone Arsenal Alabama

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
when we were
telling the commands

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and staff about
this problem, they

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:90%
asked us about remote viewing.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.236 align:middle line:84%
They actually pulled Puthoff and
Targ's book out of a briefcase

00:30:08.236 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the
table and said,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:84%
what do we do to protect
ourselves from this?

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Skip would soon be thrown
into a classified military

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%
investigation.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the
United States military

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
was working with experts Russell
Targ and Dr. Harold Puthoff

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:84%
off at the Stanford
Research Institute

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:84%
on the phenomenon
of psychic spies.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Harold Puthoff
and Russell Targ

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.980 align:middle line:84%
were studying at Stanford
Research Institute

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
a phenomena of people's ability
to describe locations that

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:84%
were distant from them in space,
distant from them in time,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:90%
by mental means alone.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Now in esoteric terms, we
might call that clairvoyance,

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:84%
but they tried to put a
different name on it that

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
sounded a little bit
more scientific, sounded

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
more acceptable
called remote viewing.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I read their
work, I was reading it

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes of a
counterintelligence specialist

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:84%
thinking, if this is true, if
what these scientists are doing

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:16.070 align:middle line:84%
is true, then this is
something that I haven't

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:90%
been doing for nine years.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be a
specialist in figuring out

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:84%
what enemy agents
might do, and this

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:84%
isn't something I had been
thinking about at all.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:84%
That was a keynote
day in my life,

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and was the beginning of
the next 10 years in my life

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:40.330 align:middle line:84%
in becoming involved in a US
government counterintelligence

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:90%
effort in remote viewing.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I came to discover that
this program that I thought

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.922 align:middle line:84%
was a very interesting
program and was a threat,

00:31:51.922 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and we really ought
to do something

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:84%
about this, had been ongoing
for a number of years,

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
funded by classified sources
within the government.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So the work that Stanford
Research had published

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:84%
were just a few
little studies not

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.690 align:middle line:84%
revealing the
totality of the effort

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:84%
that the government
had been involved

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.940 align:middle line:90%
with for a number of years.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
In the early experimentation
of remote viewing at Stanford

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Research Institute,
they found not only

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.810 align:middle line:84%
in trying to figure
out, how does this work,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
they looked into
physics explanations.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's really ultra
low frequency waves.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's the
case, then the size

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:84%
of the object remote
viewed and shielding

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.360 align:middle line:90%
could be put into effect.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So they tried doing
very small things

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.130 align:middle line:84%
inside thimble boxes,
then micro dots, and then

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.610 align:middle line:90%
atomic structures.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And they found
size didn't matter.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Then they used submarines doing
remote viewing experiments

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.340 align:middle line:90%
two miles down in the ocean.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Didn't matter.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Did not block this
low wave frequency.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So they dismissed an
electromagnetic explanation

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.230 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Then they found
quite interestingly

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:84%
in several experiments that
time didn't seem to matter.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The normal way to run a
remote viewing experiment back

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
in the early days
was like as children

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:90%
we would play hide and seek.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:31.790 align:middle line:84%
One scientist would get a
randomly generated target

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
in a sealed envelope, go
out and get in their car,

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.439 align:middle line:84%
and go to this place
that they didn't

00:33:37.439 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
know when they left in their
car where they were going.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They would open the envelope
and go to this place.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The person doing the remote
viewing, the perceiving,

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:84%
would be locked in
a laboratory room

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and simply told to describe
the location of this person

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:90%
at 10 o'clock.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And the arrangements
were, you're

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.190 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be at this
other place at 10 o'clock

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and interact with the
target in some way.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
If the target happened
to be a tower,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:90%
climb to the top of the top.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
If the target happened
to be a restaurant,

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:90%
order something to eat.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And collecting over hundreds
and hundreds of experiments,

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.380 align:middle line:84%
there was this statistical
match between the descriptions

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and where they actually
went that reinforced this.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, along came an
accident in science

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in which the person was
on the way to the target.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't 10 o'clock yet.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And the person
doing the perceiving

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
said, I know where
they're going.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And they said, well, OK.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Describe where they're going.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And he drew perfectly the
location where they were.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And so then they were
saying, how could this be?

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We know that it
doesn't depend on size

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's not electromagnetic.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But if they haven't
even got there yet, how

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.785 align:middle line:90%
is it that you could know that?

00:35:01.785 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:84%
That was a guy named
Pat Price did that.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And Pat Price made
another time mistake

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that led to the understanding
about time and distance

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:90%
not mattering.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:84%
The target location
where the person went

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:84%
was a public swimming pool
where kids were playing,

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and there were two different
sized pools and so forth.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet, Pat Price
described this

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
as being an area of pools
of water, two water towers,

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and it was a sewage
processing plant.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And so they said, well, look.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You did have pools of water,
and you were probably confused,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you called
this a sewage treatment plant.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.137 align:middle line:84%
And there was moving water,
but the towers you drew

00:35:49.137 --> 00:35:49.720 align:middle line:90%
weren't there.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.660 align:middle line:90%
You probably just imagined them.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Which by the nature of many
remote viewing transcripts,

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:84%
there's wrong
information in there.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.405 align:middle line:84%
There's enough in there that
it statistically validates,

00:36:01.405 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and then there's some things
like, I don't know why

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:90%
you drew those towers in there.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until 25 years
later when the city published

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
the historical records,
that location used

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.930 align:middle line:90%
to be a water treatment plant.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's this question
of slippage in time then.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And over the years
now-- this has

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
been ongoing for
more than 30 years--

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:84%
it seems that once you say, this
is a remote viewing situation,

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:84%
this information was
produced by a remote viewer,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:39.570 align:middle line:84%
all of the concepts of
time and space or distance

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:90%
just don't apply.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't apply.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.610 align:middle line:84%
It's no more difficult
to describe something

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:84%
with remote viewing
across the street,

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
10,000 miles away,
or on another planet.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't matter.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:90%
So in 1977, I met Bob Monroe.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the methods
I investigated

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:84%
was the Hemi-Sync technology
at The Monroe Institute.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Now at that time this was
all deeply classified,

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:90%
not declassified until 1995.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So in 1977 when
I met Mr. Monroe,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say to him,
gee, I train psychic spies

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.740 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.970 align:middle line:90%
How would your system work?

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I could not say
those words to him.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But I did develop a
friendship and a rapport,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and he described his
technology, allowed me

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:90%
to experience that technology.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we
wound up training

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:47.470 align:middle line:84%
some of our remote viewers
in this Hemi-Sync process.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>After a 35 year legacy
at The Monroe Institute,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:38:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Skip retired as the
Institute's president in 2012.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.920 align:middle line:84%
After the 2009 premiere of "The
Path: Afterlife" documentary,

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.150 align:middle line:84%
The Monroe Institute
became interested

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:84%
in the works of William Buhlman,
and now facilitates workshops

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.310 align:middle line:90%
at The Institute.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:17.730 align:middle line:84%
With over 40 years of documented
out-of-body experiences,

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:84%
William has become one
of America's top leading

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:90%
experts in the OBE phenomenon.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, I was confirmed
agnostic for quite a long time,

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.050 align:middle line:10%
up to 1972.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.180 align:middle line:10%
I had more or less rejected
all kinds of spiritual beliefs

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.302 align:middle line:10%
and the whole concept
of a hereafter.

00:38:37.302 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in college
back in 1972, a friend of mine

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
actually had a spontaneous
out-of-body experience.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And he told me about it,
and it changed his life.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.250 align:middle line:84%
It blew him away,
and he made me want

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to pursue the entire topic
because I wanted to experience

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:90%
what he experienced.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So I became extremely interested
in it, picked up a book,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and began to read
about the subject.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And I found that there were
actually methods available

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
where you could self-initiate
an out-of-body experience.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:84%
An out-of-body experience
is a broad term

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.990 align:middle line:84%
just for any form
of consciousness,

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.266 align:middle line:84%
any perception of
consciousness leaving the body.

00:39:19.266 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And even though at the time
it sounded unbelievable

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.110 align:middle line:90%
and wild I figured, why not?

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll give it a shot.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.610 align:middle line:84%
If he had an experience,
I don't see why I can't.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to pursue
it and try this technique

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%
for a period of a month.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:84%
It was an easy technique
where I would actually

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.330 align:middle line:84%
visualize three objects in
my mother's home, things

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that I had made.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was living
in a dorm-like structure

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that was about five miles
from my mother's house.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And every night as
I went to sleep,

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I just visualized myself
going to my mother's house

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and touching these
three objects.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I felt myself
there, and I tried

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.650 align:middle line:84%
to hold that as my
last conscious thought

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:90%
as I drifted off to sleep.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And for the first two
weeks, nothing much

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:09.281 align:middle line:84%
happened except for
maybe a little increase

00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:10.750 align:middle line:90%
in dream recall.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And then on the end of the
third week, suddenly I awoke.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was startled to find
that I felt different.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was sleeping in a small
single bed next to the wall.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I reached
out my arm, my hand

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:90%
actually entered the wall.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it hit
me, that oh my god.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.610 align:middle line:90%
I did this.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:90%
And I thought about standing.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
knew, I was standing

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:90%
by the foot of the bed.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was totally
real, totally conscious.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And I was just ecstatic.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, in shock.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And I began to focus and
look around the room.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I could
see beyond the physical limits

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:90%
of my small little dorm room.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that there
was someone watching me.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was someone that had
a long robe and a beard,

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and to be quite
frank, it scared me.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:90%
And the next thing I knew, snap.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:90%
I was back in my body.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And even though this
was a brief experience,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:84%
it totally changed my entire
perception of reality.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it changed
my entire life.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point I realized
that, yeah, this is for real.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.552 align:middle line:84%
This is not somebody's
hallucination.

00:41:24.552 --> 00:41:27.410 align:middle line:90%
This is heavy duty stuff.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I had
entered another reality,

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.700 align:middle line:90%
another whole dimension.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And that night, I couldn't
sleep I was so excited.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I started writing down all
my, oh my god, other people

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.350 align:middle line:90%
live in these other dimensions.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:43.900 align:middle line:84%
This is June of 1972 I became
obsessed with the topic.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I really started
pursuing it heavily then.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I started to explore
different methods

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.733 align:middle line:84%
and began to have a lot
of different experiences.

00:41:53.733 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>For the next two
decades, William Buhlman

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:84%
would travel and experience
other realities and dimensions

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:90%
apart from his physical body.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:middle line:84%
He journaled these
experiences and compiled them

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.392 align:middle line:84%
into his first book,
"Adventures Beyond the Body."

00:42:12.392 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>You know,
out-of-body experiences

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.230 align:middle line:84%
have been documented and
written about for thousands

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:21.120 align:middle line:84%
of years in all the holy
texts throughout history.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The Bible is full of references
to out-of-body experiences.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:29.150 align:middle line:84%
In 2 Corinthians,
Saint Paul talks about,

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.270 align:middle line:84%
clearly I was, whether in
the body or out of the body,

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I know not.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.960 align:middle line:84%
In another case, the
beginning of Revelations,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.600 align:middle line:84%
the fourth line
begins with, "I was

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.290 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit on the Lord's
day, and I heard behind me

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.250 align:middle line:90%
a great voice."

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on to describe
this amazing journey that's

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.760 align:middle line:84%
obviously not in
the physical world.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And the entire chapter of
Revelations by many people

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is viewed as an
out-of-body experience.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Another good one, probably
one of the best, surprisingly,

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:90%
is in the Quran.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.670 align:middle line:84%
The core story of Islam is
Mohammed's night journey,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and how he leaves his body and
enters these other dimensions.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And he clearly states
it in the Quran.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:20.290 align:middle line:84%
He talks about entering seven
distinct dimensions of reality.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And during this journey, he
encounters different beings,

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.690 align:middle line:84%
different angels on
each level of reality,

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and they give him knowledge.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
quite fascinating,

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.370 align:middle line:84%
especially when you read
this in a non-cultural.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:84%
If you take away the cultural
overtones of this experience,

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:44.650 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see this is clearly
a vivid, profound, out-of-body

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:50.430 align:middle line:84%
experience that Mohammed
had, and that he interpreted.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's no other way in
my mind to interpret this.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.080 align:middle line:84%
He's actually flying on
this mystical animal,

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
moving and communicating
with angel Gabriel

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.300 align:middle line:90%
and these other beings.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is the core element
of the entire religion

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:90%
is based on this.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.815 align:middle line:84%
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead"
is another good reference

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:12.314 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:44:12.314 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:84%
The entire book has references
to experiences beyond the body.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a training manual.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.490 align:middle line:84%
When you strip away all
the very complicated,

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:84%
let's just say mysticism
that many people feel

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
that's attached to it,
it's a training manual

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond your
body and also to go

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.340 align:middle line:90%
beyond form-based realities.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.030 align:middle line:84%
In "The Tibetan Book
of the Dead," they say,

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.870 align:middle line:84%
go to the clear
light of the void.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It is repeated again
and again and again.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
mantra of the book.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.330 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The monks will
surround someone who

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.270 align:middle line:84%
is ready to make this
transition we call death,

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and they chant
basically, oh, noble one.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Go to the clear
light of the void.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.692 align:middle line:84%
They're chanting
this in Tibetan.

00:44:59.692 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Where in the West,
of course, we're

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.810 align:middle line:84%
pumping people full of drugs
and often ignoring them.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's all about keeping
them comfortable.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet and other
Buddhist areas,

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.100 align:middle line:84%
they're actually trying
to make their transition

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.980 align:middle line:90%
to a higher plane of reality.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.180 align:middle line:90%
They call it the bardo.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:84%
To go beyond the bardo, to
go beyond the astral plane,

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond the
form-based heavens

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and to go to the higher
realms of reality.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
entire training that I

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:84%
try to, as much as possible,
to convey in my books.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:36.279 align:middle line:84%
I try to get people to go
beyond the astral plane

00:45:36.279 --> 00:45:37.820 align:middle line:84%
in their out-of-body
body experience.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Go to your higher self.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the same concept as
the Tibetan Buddhists.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I am a big journaler.

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe in
documenting everything.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.480 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So I journaled
hundreds and hundreds

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.435 align:middle line:84%
of my own out-of-body
experiences.

00:45:51.435 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It finally dawned
on me in the '90s

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.190 align:middle line:84%
that, wow, I should
write about this.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:02.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a need for a manual, a
practical manual on this topic.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:06.560 align:middle line:84%
"Adventures Beyond the Body"
is a result of basically

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.860 align:middle line:84%
at the time my 25
years' experience.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.466 align:middle line:84%
I put down a lot
of my experiences.

00:46:11.466 --> 00:46:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them,
but some of them

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I considered pivotal
experiences that

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:19.630 align:middle line:84%
had a huge impact on myself,
like meeting my mother who had

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:22.690 align:middle line:90%
died and my uncle who had died.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:90%
I go into specifics.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.990 align:middle line:84%
What do you do to
totally exit the body?

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
their legs lift up

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and they can't get a
part of their body free.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Then what do you do afterwards?

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Many people have poor vision.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:37.670 align:middle line:90%
They can't perceive.

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I go into detail about
what they should do,

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.730 align:middle line:84%
how to increase
their perception.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So I went into basically
a training manual

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.440 align:middle line:84%
about how to become more
and more proficient,

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:84%
how to address the issues that
an out-of-body explorer will

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.970 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>In the back of his book
and on William's website,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.770 align:middle line:84%
the reader can take a survey to
document their own experiences.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.920 align:middle line:10%
And for the last 10 years,
readers from around the globe

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.920 align:middle line:10%
have taken part
in William's study

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.300 align:middle line:10%
into the out-of-body phenomenon.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>I received an amazing
response from my internet survey

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.900 align:middle line:90%
and from my book surveys.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.860 align:middle line:84%
It was over 20,000 letters
from over 42 countries.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I have cases and
cases of letters.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:24.272 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:47:24.272 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, it was more
than I could physically handle.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.496 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, I compiled
these experiences.

00:47:29.496 --> 00:47:31.650 align:middle line:84%
A few years later,
I published "Secret

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Soul," which was a
compilation of other people's

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, people
should know about this.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Being a man, I was limited
to a man's experiences,

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to get
a perception-- what's

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.570 align:middle line:84%
it like for a child
to have an experience?

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:51.170 align:middle line:84%
What's it like for a pregnant
woman to have an experience?

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:90%
What's it like for a teenager?

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.700 align:middle line:84%
What is it like for
different kinds of people?

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it different for
a French person?

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Is it different for an African?

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
the answers to this.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I published a lot of it
in "Secret of the Soul."

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I put the stats in there as
far as I could go, especially

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:84%
on the vibrational
state about, what

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.590 align:middle line:84%
do people perceive in the
vibrational state, which

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:84%
is a prelude to an out-of-body
experience for most people.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, how many
people have paralysis?

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:26.080 align:middle line:90%
How many people hear noises?

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.560 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
buzzing, humming sounds?

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.910 align:middle line:84%
What percentage of
people hear a voice?

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.420 align:middle line:84%
What percentage of
people are touched?

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:39.640 align:middle line:84%
What percentage of people are,
let's just say, see or meet

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.910 align:middle line:84%
with a loved one or someone
who is not in a physical body?

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.415 align:middle line:84%
And what I tried
to do is document

00:48:47.415 --> 00:48:51.612 align:middle line:84%
to the best of my ability
these percentages.

00:48:51.612 --> 00:48:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought
it was important,

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.410 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people--
up to that point,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.320 align:middle line:84%
nobody had really
acknowledged the idea

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of a vibrational state.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
People talked about it,
but there was no evidence.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And by the vibrational
state, I mean the state

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that occurs immediately
before and after

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Because based on my
research, about 80%

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.210 align:middle line:84%
of people that have an
out-of-body experience

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.650 align:middle line:84%
will have some kind
of energy event

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.630 align:middle line:90%
that's associated with it.

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's an inner energy
event, even though it may not

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.890 align:middle line:90%
feel it to people.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But you'll feel a buzzing
sound, for instance,

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:84%
or you'll feel--
many people will

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:84%
begin to feel numb
and then paralyzed,

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and then a buzzing
sound will resonate

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.120 align:middle line:90%
through their entire body.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.090 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like-- I write
about it as like a jet engine.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But your physical body
will become paralyzed.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.130 align:middle line:90%
That's universal.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to let
go of the physical body

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to have an out-of-body
experience.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's actually quite logical.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>The survey results William
collected were staggering.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:10%
Some of the most unique examples
of spontaneous out-of-body

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.400 align:middle line:10%
experiences are those that
occur due to intense pain,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.880 align:middle line:10%
physical and mental
stress, illness,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.300 align:middle line:10%
and other traumatic incidents.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.510 align:middle line:84%
In the book "The
Secret of the Soul,"

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:84%
William documents childhood
out-of-body experiences

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.680 align:middle line:84%
ranging from four-year-olds
to teenagers.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It is important for
people to be reminded just

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.390 align:middle line:84%
how natural the
out-of-body state was

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.060 align:middle line:84%
when they were children,
before their belief systems

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.900 align:middle line:90%
were constructed.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:10%
>>Children naturally have
out-of-body experiences

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.130 align:middle line:10%
because in the younger the
child, the more prevalent

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:36.540 align:middle line:10%
they are, because children
are not as indoctrinated.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They're not as contaminated
by the culture as adults.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:10%
>>When you're young,
three, four, five,

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.750 align:middle line:10%
you can have one
foot in this reality

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:47.520 align:middle line:10%
and one foot in the other.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:84%
You're a little more in
touch with things like that.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But as you get more centered
in this physical reality,

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.890 align:middle line:84%
again, that stuff
kind of goes away.

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Three-year-olds
are more intuitive.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Five and six-year-olds do
out-of-body all the time.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:90%
They're more connected.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.305 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, that just,
again, fades like a dream.

00:51:05.305 --> 00:51:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It goes away, and then they're
no longer connected that way.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Especially up to the
age before puberty,

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.730 align:middle line:90%
they're very open.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And especially between
the ages of four and six

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:23.050 align:middle line:84%
or seven, that is where I have
received most of my letters--

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I would say over a thousand just
in that age group-- of parents

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that are saying that their
children not only have

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:33.390 align:middle line:84%
an experience, they're
having multiple experiences.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Parents were taking their
children to the psychologist

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:38.960 align:middle line:84%
because they were entering
the vibrational state.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.794 align:middle line:84%
Their children are
hearing vibrations,

00:51:40.794 --> 00:51:42.210 align:middle line:84%
they're hearing
sounds, their kids

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.560 align:middle line:84%
are talking about floating
out of their body.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their kids are talking
about meeting their aunt.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately in our
society, what do most parents

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.350 align:middle line:90%
say to their children?

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It was just a dream.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what an
imagination you have.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you talked to grandma.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.405 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:52:02.405 --> 00:52:05.360 align:middle line:90%
They don't accept it as real.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a dream.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the way it is.

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, people are
beginning to awaken to that.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>At night, a lot of kids fight
about bedtime, going to bed.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't
want to go to bed.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay up and do
this and so forth and so on.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I was always eager to go
to bed because for me, it

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:90%
was like watching television.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:35.240 align:middle line:10%
And many times I would, at
night, jump out the window

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.240 align:middle line:10%
and fly over to my friend's
house and play with my friends.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.304 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
everybody does at night.

00:52:40.304 --> 00:52:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's why we sleep.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're
awake and we do this,

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and then we go to bed
at night so that we

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.490 align:middle line:90%
can go do this other stuff.

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But along with
that process, I was

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:55.410 align:middle line:84%
quite old-- eight,
nine years old--

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.970 align:middle line:90%
and had a bed wetting problem.

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember very distinctly
one night waking up in bed,

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:90%
and I was mad.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:09.832 align:middle line:84%
I was just furious, and I
was screaming and tantruming.

00:53:09.832 --> 00:53:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And my mother came running
in and said, what's wrong?

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.540 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.456 align:middle line:90%
Did you hurt yourself?

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and I
said, I remember I got up

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and I went into the bathroom.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.730 align:middle line:90%
I sat on the toilet.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I began to pee, I woke
up here, and I was all wet.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I am mad.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And she grabbed me
and she cuddled me

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and she says, oh, that's OK.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.510 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:32.610 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.820 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know,
you have to remember

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.412 align:middle line:84%
to take your body with you
when you go to the bathroom?

00:53:37.412 --> 00:53:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:41.097 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, sometimes
you're in your body,

00:53:41.097 --> 00:53:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you're
not in your body.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But when it's time to
go to the bathroom,

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.780 align:middle line:84%
you always have to
check that you're

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.790 align:middle line:84%
going to take your
body with you in there.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:52.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ohh.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And I never wet my bed again.

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>There are no limits to
the type of experiences

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.230 align:middle line:84%
a person can have once they
leave the physical world

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.400 align:middle line:90%
during an OBE.

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Shared experiences
in the nonphysical

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.230 align:middle line:84%
have been reported
by many others.

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>My wife and I have
had experiences together

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that are quite remarkable
because there's

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:13.890 align:middle line:90%
no limits to what can happen.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.960 align:middle line:84%
For many people, this
may sound strange.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It really provides a
tremendous opportunity

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.440 align:middle line:84%
for personal growth
for people because it's

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.759 align:middle line:84%
also a powerful confirmation
that their experience is valid.

00:54:25.759 --> 00:54:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
come back and you're

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.820 align:middle line:90%
sharing it with another person.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I think I had over 30
experiences that people have

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.340 align:middle line:84%
sent to me where
they were together

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:41.110 align:middle line:84%
on another plane of
existence, totally conscious.

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was much older,
probably late '20s

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:84%
when I was going
out-of-body then

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:51.660 align:middle line:84%
purposefully-- this is after I'd
been out to Monroe laboratory--

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:56.520 align:middle line:84%
then I would go get my
son who was at the time,

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.710 align:middle line:84%
like, five, six, somewhere
in that same bracket.

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go out together.

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.561 align:middle line:10%
And it was like a fun thing
we would do in the evenings,

00:55:02.561 --> 00:55:03.060 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go out.

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.150 align:middle line:90%
We would have adventures.

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:06.720 align:middle line:90%
It was always a lot of fun.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And it would blow his
mom's mind in the morning

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.930 align:middle line:84%
because he would
tell all about them.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:12.346 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
would blow her mind

00:55:12.346 --> 00:55:14.760 align:middle line:84%
was that I had already
told her about them an hour

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.650 align:middle line:90%
before he woke up.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd get his story,
which would of course be

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.090 align:middle line:90%
from his perspective.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good father
and son activity.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I have about 15
mothers who have written

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:32.620 align:middle line:84%
to me that have actually
had communication

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.030 align:middle line:90%
with their future children.

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, a
couple of these women

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:40.460 align:middle line:84%
are naming their children
the same name that they were

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.750 align:middle line:90%
told that they are called now.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That's how clear--
in other words,

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:48.240 align:middle line:84%
they meet the individual in
the astral plane and they say,

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.450 align:middle line:84%
my name is Robert, and I'm
going to be your child.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds like, oh my god.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:90%
But people are relating this.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I have had experiences
myself where my wife and I have

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:06.410 align:middle line:90%
had shared distant experiences.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:07.049 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:56:07.049 --> 00:56:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a
bus load of people,

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and we were feeding them.

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did you see
when the guy in the blue truck

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.460 align:middle line:90%
went by?

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Said, yeah.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't want
to eat at the table

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.312 align:middle line:84%
where we were serving
the food kind of a thing.

00:56:16.312 --> 00:56:18.589 align:middle line:84%
And then we go on
about our lives.

00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't think any
big deal about it.

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We just know that we
were elsewhere together,

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and we did something.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And we don't start a church
over it or anything else.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.830 align:middle line:84%
We just accept that as
those things happen.

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>In August of 2009,
Dennis Mennerich

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.630 align:middle line:84%
attended one of Tom's
workshops in Toronto, Canada,

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:84%
which allowed the
opportunity to film

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and discuss in more detail one
of the first profound shared

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.840 align:middle line:84%
experiences they had at
Robert Monroe's laboratory.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Bob had an exercise
for Dennis and I

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:48.980 align:middle line:90%
to go out-of-body together.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And he just kind of sprung
that on us while we were there.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So we were willing
to try anything.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And we were in the
try anything mode.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And we decided we'd meet
right up above the lab,

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and then we'd just go up
together and see what happens.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I think,
about an hour and a half,

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.050 align:middle line:90%
close to two hours.

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were a lot of
specific things going on.

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.250 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just that
we sat in the void

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and didn't say
anything to each other.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a pretty
eventful experience.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And we came back.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And the lights are always
bright once you come out

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.800 align:middle line:84%
of that dark, absolutely
black hole that you're in.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And we stumbled out in
the light and stumbled up

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to the control room.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was Bob, his
usual sardonic wit.

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of had this
little smirk on his face.

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, do you guys
really think you were together?

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.260 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And we said, eh, you
know, it seemed like it.

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:43.557 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I said, it
seemed like it to me.

00:57:43.557 --> 00:57:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, well,
it seemed like it to him.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we hadn't
talked about it at all.

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:52.170 align:middle line:84%
We still had no idea
what each other had--

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So then Bob turned around in
his swivel chair and says,

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:54.990 align:middle line:90%
well, here.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And he flipped both
the tape switches on.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:01.511 align:middle line:84%
So Dennis' tape, which was made
just between Dennis and Bob,

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and my tape, which was just
made between me and Bob-- and we

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.426 align:middle line:84%
could not hear
each other, we were

00:58:05.426 --> 00:58:09.510 align:middle line:84%
in isolation booths-- started
to play at the same time.

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:12.349 align:middle line:84%
And there was Dennis
and I, interacting.

00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:13.890 align:middle line:84%
There we were seeing
the same things,

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.740 align:middle line:84%
describing the
same kind of stuff.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And it went on and on and on.

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And my mouth kind of fell open.

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:23.610 align:middle line:84%
The jaw hit the floor, and
it was like, oh my gosh.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:24.410 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:27.539 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I felt.
And I repeated that 50 times

00:58:27.539 --> 00:58:29.330 align:middle line:84%
over the next couple
of weeks because there

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:32.210 align:middle line:90%
was no way to justify that.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:36.100 align:middle line:84%
We carry our doubt to
a pretty far extreme.

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not going to
give in and say this is real

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:43.580 align:middle line:84%
until we really know there's
no other-- absolutely no

00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.450 align:middle line:90%
other choice.

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And just telling us
that it was a thousand

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.115 align:middle line:84%
to one that we could do what we
had done, that wasn't enough.

00:58:50.115 --> 00:58:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But this was enough
because there

00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:52.750 align:middle line:90%
was no wiggle room in this.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.930 align:middle line:84%
There was no other way that
this could have happened other

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.740 align:middle line:84%
than Dennis and I were
out-of-body together

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:02.649 align:middle line:84%
and we saw the same things, and
we had the same conversations.

00:59:02.649 --> 00:59:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like
what you'd expect

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:08.720 align:middle line:84%
if you had two different tapes
of a conversation with people.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.574 align:middle line:90%
It was different.

00:59:09.574 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:84%
We obviously didn't the same
words to describe everything,

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.960 align:middle line:84%
but that was because we
were two different people.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.418 align:middle line:84%
We have two different
perspectives.

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:17.584 align:middle line:84%
But it was so close
and so tied together

00:59:17.584 --> 00:59:18.750 align:middle line:90%
that it was just astounding.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And Bob was just thrilled.

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:23.080 align:middle line:90%
His eyes were lit up.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.610 align:middle line:90%
It was like Christmas for Bob.

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And my jaw dropped
to the ground.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God for me.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And that was the big one.

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And after that, there
was no doubt in my mind

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that what I was doing was
exploring a different reality

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:41.740 align:middle line:84%
frame, and that it
was every much as

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.330 align:middle line:90%
real as this reality frame.

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:46.077 align:middle line:84%
And there just wasn't
any longer any doubt.

00:59:46.077 --> 00:59:47.910 align:middle line:84%
After that, it was not
trying to figure out,

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:49.530 align:middle line:84%
is this real, which
is really what

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:52.850 align:middle line:84%
our mission was for the first
year or two that we were there.

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to
determine, is this real?

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course Bob knew it was
real, but that was Bob.

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:00.670 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know it
was real until we

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.120 align:middle line:90%
could prove that for ourselves.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>I think a lot of
the things that we

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.685 align:middle line:90%
did were kind of subjective.

01:00:06.685 --> 01:00:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And you go through it,
and when you're doing it,

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.709 align:middle line:90%
it seems to be very valid.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But then when you get a
little space and you say,

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, did that
really happen, or am

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.810 align:middle line:90%
I making that up kind of things.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you really didn't have a
lot of concrete, objective data

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
to prove that the
experiences were real.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.276 align:middle line:84%
But something like this
is just-- like you said,

01:00:41.276 --> 01:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
you just can't ignore
things like this.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>After that, the
mission changed.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It was no longer, is this real?

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It was, how does this work?

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:49.890 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:50.760 align:middle line:90%
What are the limits?

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
What are the constraints?

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:53.630 align:middle line:90%
What are the rules?

01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So my whole focus
on it shifted from,

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.000 align:middle line:90%
is this real to what's going on?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Our scientists and
explorers don't stop

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.960 align:middle line:90%
at the out-of-body experience.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they begin
to research, study,

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand the inner
workings of the nonphysical.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It is no longer a compilation
of many experiences,

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.820 align:middle line:84%
but now it becomes
a way of life.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.039 align:middle line:84%
>>Once you get started
in something like this,

01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't just say,
oh, that was fun.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Forget about it and
do something else.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.980 align:middle line:90%
This is a way of being.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's more than a way of life.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of being.

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And being a physicist,
I'm interested in learning

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:35.060 align:middle line:90%
how things work.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I try to find out
how reality works.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept experimenting
and kept studying it

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and kept researching it.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Kept going places,
kept exploring,

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
pushing the boundaries back,
trying to figure out why.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Why does it work this way?

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Why is it sometimes this
way, and sometimes that way?

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.260 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.900 align:middle line:90%
What are the rules here?

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
What it's about
is consciousness.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to start
with an explanation,

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd say start with
consciousness.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of us have
consciousness, right?

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:10.850 align:middle line:90%
We're all conscious.

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And that means we're aware.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
What we're aware of is
our physical reality.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
That's our universe.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:20.724 align:middle line:84%
Our planets and
our solar system.

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not really too
much aware of that,

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're aware of our universe,
and we're a part of it.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think
about that awareness,

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
you realize that that
awareness is just data.

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just information.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I see you, you see
me, but what's that?

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.660 align:middle line:90%
It's data.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It's modulated,
electromagnetic waves

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
that are bouncing
off of me and you,

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're processing
it in the brain

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and interpreting those
electromagnetic pulses

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.630 align:middle line:90%
as people.

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're taking the data,
and we're interpreting

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.472 align:middle line:90%
it to form our reality.

01:02:49.472 --> 01:02:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, everything's like that.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.888 align:middle line:90%
All the senses are like that.

01:02:51.888 --> 01:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything you hear, see, smell,
touch, is just data input.

01:02:57.530 --> 01:03:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you interpret
that data to be something.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course,
there's also rules.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
There's rules that how the
data can relate to each other.

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So my data says that
there is a wall.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
My experience tells me I
cannot walk through it.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a solid object.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of Newton's
laws, that two things

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
can't occupy the same
point at the same time.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>We know that all
of these things

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
are just mental projections
in our mind's eye.

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's really data bits being
processed by our brains.

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we think
we agree that we're

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
seeing the same thing and call
this reality is a supposition.

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
There's no proof in physics
of a Cartesian reality.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Now can we extend
that proposition then?

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
If two people meet
in another dimension

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and report back the
same information,

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.220 align:middle line:90%
can we then assume?

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Is there an implication
that this then

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is real if more than one
person can relate to that?

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Think of consciousness
as the fundamental reality.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.550 align:middle line:90%
We are consciousness.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Period.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is digital,
so it deals with data.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Data, with rules,
creates realities.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.910 align:middle line:90%
This is our reality.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Physics is the rule set.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.875 align:middle line:90%
So are we only reality?

01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Is this virtual reality it?

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer to that is no.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
virtual realities.

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
When you take this as
a premise, then you

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
can explain a lot of things
that are now unexplainable.

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Using this premise
of virtual realities

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
explains physics
better than physics

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
can be explained without it.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:55.094 align:middle line:84%
This model of reality actually
solves a whole lot mysteries

01:04:55.094 --> 01:04:56.260 align:middle line:90%
if you think of it this way.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:00.785 align:middle line:84%
It solves a lot of
things that can't happen.

01:05:00.785 --> 01:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The paranormal things,
the UFO things,

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.744 align:middle line:90%
and those other big mysteries.

01:05:05.744 --> 01:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Where they're
dealing with aliens,

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and the aliens take them
up to their spaceship

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and do experiments on them and
the rest of that, a lot of that

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
has to do with things
that are happening to them

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.410 align:middle line:90%
in another reality system.

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:19.279 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean it's
not happening to them.

01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
it's not happening

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.220 align:middle line:90%
to them in this reality system.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody happened
to be in their room

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that night with a movie camera,
they wouldn't see any of it.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.912 align:middle line:84%
This person sees it
all in experiences,

01:05:30.912 --> 01:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and indeed, he is
taken up to some place,

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:38.175 align:middle line:84%
and indeed people are doing
things to him and so on.

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And these other
beings are beings

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that are traveling around and
are studying other beings.

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So this stuff happens, but
it's not the way they think.

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:49.632 align:middle line:84%
It's not the UFO who
travels in a saucer,

01:05:49.632 --> 01:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and the saucer people come
down and snatch him up out

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
of their beds.

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:54.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not happening.

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.917 align:middle line:84%
That's just what they
rationalize to explain it.

01:05:57.917 --> 01:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like, are all
these people liars?

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Are they all psychotic?

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And why do all the psychotic
people see similar things?

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's more to it than
just people who are nuts,

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
just like with the little kids.

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's more to it than just
kids who are hallucinating.

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So you put them on
mind altering drugs

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to keep them from hallucinating.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:21.305 align:middle line:84%
They are getting their data
from this physical matter frame,

01:06:21.305 --> 01:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're getting some from
a different physical matter

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.510 align:middle line:90%
frame.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But they can't separate it, so
they're parallel processing.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I do that all the time,
but I know what I'm doing,

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.110 align:middle line:90%
so it's not like I'm confused.

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:34.620 align:middle line:90%
I know there's two frames.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.512 align:middle line:84%
If you know there's
two-- if you have two TVs

01:06:36.512 --> 01:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and each has a different
ball game on it,

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.261 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't confuse you.

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:41.300 align:middle line:84%
You know there's
two things going on.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
that and you're

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:45.361 align:middle line:84%
just listening to two
ball games at once

01:06:45.361 --> 01:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and you don't realize that
it's two ball games, that's

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.105 align:middle line:90%
it's, what is that jumble?

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:50.340 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand it.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, they don't
understand it, it so they

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:53.340 align:middle line:90%
think it's all in this reality.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in their mind,
there is only one reality.

01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's this one,
and it's physical.

01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, when they see
something from another reality,

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.557 align:middle line:90%
they think it's here.

01:07:01.557 --> 01:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like the little
children who see things

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
and have their playmates.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:09.056 align:middle line:84%
Those playmates are things that
they're doing in their mind.

01:07:09.056 --> 01:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
They're nonphysical playmates,
but to them, they're

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.070 align:middle line:90%
physical playmates.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
see them, they're

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
here because this
is the only reality

01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
they've got in their mind.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't intellectually
say, I'm parallel processing.

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
That's too big a thought
for a five-year-old.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.220 align:middle line:90%
You're consciousness.

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you're plugged into
a different data stream.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:31.197 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell that from
here, so you say it is here.

01:07:31.197 --> 01:07:32.030 align:middle line:90%
You think it's here.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now you see things
floating around

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
because they don't float
around in your reality,

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.340 align:middle line:90%
so that's really weird.

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You have these
real weird stories

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
about aliens and
spaceships and stuff.

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So most of it is a very
similar kind of thing.

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.030 align:middle line:90%
It's spontaneous.

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
These things happen
spontaneously to some people.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Bob Monroe spontaneously
had out-of-body experiences.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Some people just spontaneously
will plug into another reality

01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.105 align:middle line:90%
frame for a while.

01:07:59.105 --> 01:08:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Then it goes away.

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>As you begin to
explore in altered states

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.760 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, you
will find the universe

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.280 align:middle line:84%
has countless dimensions and
realities to be explored.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
This universe is
multi-dimensional,

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and the places of exploration
are almost limitless.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, let's go back for a
minute to Bob Monroe's stories

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.399 align:middle line:84%
and this first experimentation
of being in bed,

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
feeling this sort of vibration
of puffing up and collapsing,

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:29.229 align:middle line:84%
puffing and collapsing,
puffing and collapsing, that he

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.149 align:middle line:90%
got over the fear of that.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:34.399 align:middle line:84%
And then when he could
feel himself sort of loose,

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:38.930 align:middle line:84%
as it were, then he would
push that other hand

01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that he perhaps thought he
had down through the floor.

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And he could feel the insulation
and the nails, and so forth.

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And he'd pull his hand back up.

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:50.569 align:middle line:84%
And then they
began to experiment

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:53.510 align:middle line:84%
in his house, and
then his neighborhood,

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and then there were a few
earthly places he went to.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:03.439 align:middle line:84%
And then there were beings that
he met and said, come with me,

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you
something else.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.689 align:middle line:84%
He called that in
this first book

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
"locale two," meaning
that locale one

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.970 align:middle line:90%
was this earth stuff.

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And he became fascinated
in this other realm

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
called locale two, which
was just there's here,

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
the other place.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
This is locale one,
that's locale two.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
In his later books, he found
there are many other places,

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:35.580 align:middle line:90%
other worlds, other dimensions.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
boring and primitive.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:42.729 align:middle line:90%
>>This is just one.

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:44.891 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of virtual
realities out there.

01:09:44.891 --> 01:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
This consciousness system
didn't just put all its eggs

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.180 align:middle line:90%
in this one basket.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.747 align:middle line:84%
There's other virtual realities,
and they're all different.

01:09:50.747 --> 01:09:51.830 align:middle line:90%
They have different rules.

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
They're not all
the same rule sets.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So it is a big,
complex world out there

01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:57.660 align:middle line:90%
in the world of consciousness.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.860 align:middle line:10%
>>I found it amazing that when
I was leaving my body, just how

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.350 align:middle line:10%
many different
realities existed,

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:06.980 align:middle line:10%
and how many dimensions, and
many of the old models that

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.740 align:middle line:10%
were presented.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a
seven within seven.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I have found they
are not accurate.

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:15.650 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
astral plane is

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:19.610 align:middle line:84%
filled with thousands,
countless realities

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.490 align:middle line:90%
and vibrational levels.

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:23.390 align:middle line:90%
It was immense.

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely immense
beyond my expectations.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.469 align:middle line:84%
It would take lifetimes
just to explore that.

01:10:29.469 --> 01:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>We're not the center of
this physical universe.

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
We're not the center of
the conscious universe.

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
We're just individual conscious
entities trying to grow up.

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
This physical matter
reality has spawned billions

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:42.835 align:middle line:90%
of different of life forms.

01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:45.293 align:middle line:84%
We probably have a billion just
different kinds of insects.

01:10:45.293 --> 01:10:46.930 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of life forms here.

01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other
reality frames haven't

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.020 align:middle line:90%
been sleeping all this time.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They've also spawned
billions of life forms.

01:10:54.390 --> 01:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And the life forms
fit the rule set that

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.480 align:middle line:90%
defines the virtual reality.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's things
that exist there

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that don't exist here because we
have a narrower rule set here.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.614 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
things out there

01:11:08.614 --> 01:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
that have never even heard
of this reality frame.

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:13.857 align:middle line:84%
The humans on Earth are
like a fly speck somewhere.

01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.190 align:middle line:90%
There they don't know it exists.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They have their own systems
that they work with.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like we're the
center of this consciousness

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.460 align:middle line:90%
universe.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Once your consciousness
leaves this physical world

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and enters the nonphysical, your
mental focus and state of mind

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
drives your experience
into these other realities.

01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, consciousness
is moved by intent.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>The where you go to,
apparently from our ability

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to understand based on our
own experience and our command

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
of the language,
the where you go to

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
seems to depend
upon your intent.

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Consciousness is moved by
intent, conscious intent.

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:57.040 align:middle line:90%
You might call it will.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.360 align:middle line:90%
It's what you intend to happen.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So I can send you a
message by intending

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.670 align:middle line:90%
to send you a message.

01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it really happens
anyway when we talk.

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Before the word comes
out of my mouth,

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I have an intention of
what it is I want to say.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I take that intention
of the communication,

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I put it into thoughts, the
thoughts go into symbols,

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:20.759 align:middle line:84%
the symbols come out
as acoustic vibrations,

01:12:20.759 --> 01:12:22.425 align:middle line:84%
and then you get it
and do the opposite.

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You take the acoustics
vibrations, turn them

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
into symbols, the
symbols mean things,

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.120 align:middle line:90%
turns back into thought.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're going through
this little process here.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>So the way in which you can
declare or purify or objectify

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:39.760 align:middle line:84%
your intent seems to be the
navigational beacon or tool

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that takes you to wherever
this other place is, other

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
than this local world, or
what Bob called locale one.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>A normal OBE can be
turned into a highly

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
spiritual experience
by you focusing

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:58.980 align:middle line:90%
your mind into your intention.

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Because our intention rules.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Our intention rules
our experiences.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
This opens up a door to
all kinds of, I feel,

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
profound and advanced
spiritual development,

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
far beyond anything
that's taught today.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Now you have to
focus that intent,

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and you have to focus it
without a lot of noise.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why usually
meditation is first

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's how you
get rid of the noise

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and get that clear, still
spot where you're just

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
point consciousness,
no chatter going on.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Then you're focused.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
If you can maintain
that focus and have

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
a clear intent of what
you want to accomplish,

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:34.810 align:middle line:90%
then you can accomplish it.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>All of our
form-based realities,

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:42.060 align:middle line:84%
physical and nonphysical,
they're all created by thought.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything is a
thought form in a way,

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.055 align:middle line:84%
if you could look
at it that way.

01:13:45.055 --> 01:13:46.280 align:middle line:90%
An energetic thought form.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there's many
negative thought forms

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
because humanity,
six billion of us,

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.290 align:middle line:90%
are creating negative thoughts.

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:55.799 align:middle line:84%
So yes, when you
leave your body,

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:58.215 align:middle line:84%
of course there's going to be
negative things encountered.

01:13:58.215 --> 01:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll be the last person to
say that that's not a fact.

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:06.656 align:middle line:84%
The point is though, we are far
more powerful as the creators.

01:14:06.656 --> 01:14:09.190 align:middle line:90%


01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.330 align:middle line:90%
We create our own reality.

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We create it when
we leave our body,

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
we create our own reality
in the physical world.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
There's basically
like attracts like.

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
There's an energetic
connection to all things.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you are not
harboring negative thoughts,

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
attracted to negative thoughts.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.439 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the basic things
I found about leaving my body.

01:14:33.439 --> 01:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you get a
whole lot of people

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.790 align:middle line:84%
on the planet thinking
disaster, disaster, earthquakes,

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
terrible things, it's
all going to end, that

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.200 align:middle line:90%
helps bring about that reality.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
The natural way that the
consciousness system works

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.520 align:middle line:90%
is that it produces your fears.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
What you are afraid of, it
will materialize for you.

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're really afraid
that nobody will like you,

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
then you act in a way that
makes nobody like you.

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you're afraid
that nobody will like you,

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
you will be withdrawn, or
you will be aggressive,

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.630 align:middle line:84%
or you will be some other way
that makes people not like you.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.370 align:middle line:90%
You make your fears come true.

01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
just psychology.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
consciousness works.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:19.432 align:middle line:84%
The whole conscious system,
it's fundamental nature.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
You will make your
fears come true.

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:22.720 align:middle line:90%
You create your own reality.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>So most of the
fear-based beliefs

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that dominate our society
today, unfortunately,

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:31.650 align:middle line:90%
they're totally unnecessary.

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Fear of evil influence,
fear-- there's

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
so many fears out there that
are hindering people's progress.

01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:40.430 align:middle line:90%
They're totally unnecessary.

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're quite
archaic, actually.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Especially these ideas of
devils and Satan and blah.

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on and on.

01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:53.417 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are man-made creations.

01:15:53.417 --> 01:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, there'd be
some religious people

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.154 align:middle line:84%
that if you said, oh
yes, I go out-of-body,

01:15:57.154 --> 01:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
they'd say, oh, work of the
devil, or something like that.

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people
who are like that.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
They are very narrow in
their reality system.

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.260 align:middle line:84%
They have very,
very narrow ideas.

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And they're trapped in that box.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.040 align:middle line:84%
If they get in a mindset
with beliefs and things

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
that narrow them
into a small box,

01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
for them to evolve,

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:18.340 align:middle line:84%
to be what it is they naturally
are, which is consciousness.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of these biblical
tales of devils and demons

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
may have been misinterpreted
all throughout history.

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Think of it.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if they were
all misinterpreted,

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and all these stories of
devils and demons, maybe

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
they were all just
confrontations with someone's

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:41.870 align:middle line:90%
fear that was misinterpreted.

01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, anybody,
any confrontation

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
with an evil entity is
actually a positive.

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity
for us to grow.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know many
people can't accept.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:59.250 align:middle line:84%
They feel this is
a strange concept.

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.800 align:middle line:90%
But I know this to be a fact.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a powerful fact.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the advantages
of self-initiated OBEs

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it allows
you the opportunity

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to confront and
resolve your own fear.

01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>If you have fear--
if, let's say, you

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
have fear that
you can't get back

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:20.030 align:middle line:84%
when you're in that
reality, there's a big wall.

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:21.534 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's your fear.

01:17:21.534 --> 01:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not that somebody just
constructed a wall there

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.780 align:middle line:90%
to be mean to you.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.290 align:middle line:90%
You're running into your fear.

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
If you run into beings
that are not nice to you

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and struggle with
you, that's your fear

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:33.810 align:middle line:90%
that you're dealing with.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are your own
demons, so to speak.

01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
If you have belief
systems, you'll

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
run into things that work
with those belief systems.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you're very religious,
you may see angels and people

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:48.450 align:middle line:84%
walking around in robes
and things like that.

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're not, you
may see other things.

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd like to tell a
story real briefly.

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it will clarify
this whole thing

01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of fear
about negative influences.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people still
feel that people

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
need to be exorcised
of evil spirits and all

01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:05.910 align:middle line:90%
these other aspects.

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:08.270 align:middle line:90%
This I think will clarify it.

01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I once had an out-of-body
experience where

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:12.710 align:middle line:90%
I had a normal separation.

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I left my body.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And I walked through-- often
I will walk-- a focus door now

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:19.020 align:middle line:90%
is my focus.

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.500 align:middle line:90%
I go through the door.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm out into my
hallway of my home.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It's still physical-like.

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that
suddenly there are

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.230 align:middle line:90%
steps going up and going down.

01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:33.130 align:middle line:10%
There's steps going up to a
very bright, golden light,

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:37.650 align:middle line:10%
and there's steps going down
to a very dark, dank place.

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing at this landing
between these two realities.

01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing
there in awe really

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.580 align:middle line:90%
of-- oh my god, look at this.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.750 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful
staircase going up

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and this dark
staircase going down.

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:55.400 align:middle line:10%
And I'm standing
here just staring.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And as I do, I
realize that there's

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
a dark energy, dark figure
at the bottom of the steps.

01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And this dark creature is
starting to move up the steps.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what it was.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I just stood there
almost frozen with fear

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
as this creature starts to
come up the steps towards me.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And as it emerges from the
darkness of the basement

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, I realize
that it's a giant sloth

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
about nine foot tall
with the face of a dog

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and huge claws that were
like four inches long.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's moving up
the steps slowly,

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like it's just
going to tear me to shreds.

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm standing there.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not always brave.

01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to
avoid this scenario,

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I could just think of my
body, and I'm instantly back

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:46.160 align:middle line:90%
in my body to avoid it.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But I'm stood there
frozen basically with fear

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:53.280 align:middle line:84%
as this creature starts
to come up to me.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And it literally wraps its
huge, hairy arms around me

01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and grasps me, and then
this giant dog face

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.740 align:middle line:90%
comes down and licks my face.

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the entire
creature dissolved away.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
felt this huge burst

01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:13.940 align:middle line:90%
of energy flowing through me.

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And then I realized, oh my god.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I just felt wave after wave
of energy flowing through me.

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The creature's gone,
dissolved away.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
instantaneously that what

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:32.290 align:middle line:90%
the heck was this monster?

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a manifestation
of my own fear.

01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I just confronted a
manifestation, a collection,

01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:42.380 align:middle line:90%
you could say, of my own fear.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
by standing there,

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
by being firm, whatever
you want to call it,

01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
even though I was fearful,
I confronted my own fear.

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
There's is a powerful
lesson in this.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I've had many different
scenarios of this

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.010 align:middle line:90%
occur my life in my OBEs.

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
They're not independent
life forms as such.

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, people
limit themselves

01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
by their acceptance of
these negative beliefs.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
realize they've done it.

01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Whatever you believe
creates a limitation.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I would venture to say that
all beliefs are basically

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%
limitations.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.315 align:middle line:84%
And then you learn to work
with those limitations

01:21:21.315 --> 01:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
or work around those
limitations with some other way.

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
People go through
all these rituals.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
First thing they do is they give
affirmations and incantations,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.815 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going in to
visit the nonphysical,

01:21:32.815 --> 01:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
but I only want to meet
people that are good.

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
meet any monsters,

01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:36.940 align:middle line:90%
and please don't hurt me.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they go through
all of this stuff

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that they've got to say
first before they can go.

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have to go through
that because they're fearful.

01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is a tool that they
use to feel like now they're

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.809 align:middle line:90%
separate from it.

01:21:49.809 --> 01:21:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Now they're invulnerable.

01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Now they have their shield.

01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:53.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, with my handy shield
I'll be all right,

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and I won't have
to worry about it.

01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:56.596 align:middle line:84%
So now they can go
forth because they've

01:21:56.596 --> 01:21:58.420 align:middle line:90%
got their handy shield on it.

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have
tools that we create

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
that help us do these things.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And all the tool is is a device
to help us focus our intent.

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The shield is
unnecessary, but it

01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
lets them intend to
be unassessable, let's

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.390 align:middle line:90%
them intend to be invulnerable.

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:19.515 align:middle line:84%
Now they have the intent
that they're invulnerable,

01:22:19.515 --> 01:22:20.514 align:middle line:90%
and they won't get hurt.

01:22:20.514 --> 01:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, now they're
invulnerable, so hey, it works.

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
With practice, you can
produce tools that suit you,

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.980 align:middle line:84%
or you can eventually learn
to let go of tools so you

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.730 align:middle line:90%
don't use tools.

01:22:34.730 --> 01:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's harder because
we don't think that way.

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:39.932 align:middle line:84%
Our minds just
don't work that way.

01:22:39.932 --> 01:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you just go out and
try to do it without tools,

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
you'd probably find it doesn't
work very well for you.

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it works
for your intellect.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.405 align:middle line:84%
So belief basically
gets in the way.

01:22:51.405 --> 01:22:53.780 align:middle line:84%
It's because of our beliefs
that we need all these tools.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have
these beliefs, we

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.480 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't need all these tools.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So the tool sets are ways to
get around our beliefs, really.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
To circumvent the beliefs
that are limitations.

01:23:02.730 --> 01:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Now the meditation
tool is a tool

01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that helps you get
to that clear space

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
where you've quieted
all the thoughts.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
One way people meditate
is to bring up an image.

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.590 align:middle line:90%
And they look at that image.

01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that works
is that the image because it

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.430 align:middle line:84%
busies their mind with this
image, they start forgetting.

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:23.074 align:middle line:84%
All the other thoughts
start to go away

01:23:23.074 --> 01:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
because they get consumed
with this one image.

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And then once they're
in this alone space,

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing but them and the
image, they let the image go.

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.430 align:middle line:90%
They're in meditation state.

01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%
That's another way to meditate.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.454 align:middle line:84%
Bring up a picture
of a soccer ball, OK?

01:23:37.454 --> 01:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Then let the soccer
ball rotate, and you

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
can see the little black
things going around the side

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:41.730 align:middle line:90%
as it rotates.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And rotate it faster,
and rotate it slower,

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.890 align:middle line:90%
and then slow it down.

01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, in
order to do that,

01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
you're so focused
on that soccer ball

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.550 align:middle line:90%
that everything else is gone.

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And then let the soccer ball
go, and now you're alone.

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.590 align:middle line:90%
If you can maintain that state.

01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that
now you're just

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
back here without your soccer
ball, than state goes away.

01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And you were in
that altered state,

01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:04.160 align:middle line:84%
but now you jump right
back to this state.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So again, that belief
gets in your way.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.180 align:middle line:90%
So see, it's really very simple.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Having an out
of body experience

01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
is not a difficult state
of consciousness to obtain.

01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:18.390 align:middle line:84%
We make it difficult
with our fears, beliefs,

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and by making our tools
complex and sacred,

01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
preventing us from
reaching our destination.

01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>How do you get there?

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just shift
your consciousness.

01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that sounds like,
oh, that's too easy.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't just shift
my consciousness.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.081 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

01:24:33.081 --> 01:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because you
have all these beliefs.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.120 align:middle line:90%
You have these limitations.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.119 align:middle line:84%
You have these other
things that get in the way.

01:24:38.119 --> 01:24:40.270 align:middle line:90%
You could.

01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of
learning something new.

01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of letting
go of something old.

01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:47.735 align:middle line:84%
It always requires
us doing something.

01:24:47.735 --> 01:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to do with doing.

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:51.015 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with being.

01:24:51.015 --> 01:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with you
being consciousness.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You can just connect to
another reality frame

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
just because you want to,
because you're intent,

01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
because you connect
to that frame.

01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go lie
down, get into this state,

01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
get in oscillation
state, get out of body.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't have-- all that
process is just process

01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to make us feel better because
we feel like we have to do

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.230 align:middle line:90%
something to get somewhere.

01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
If we really understood
ourselves as consciousness,

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.970 align:middle line:84%
you can go there just because
you intend to go there.

01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it immediately.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to first
get real fuzzy in the mind

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and do something weird.

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:31.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to use tools.

01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
really do any of that.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number of people say,
Tom, I want to go out of body.

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to experience these
other reality frames.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:40.820 align:middle line:84%
But I get up there and I
meditate and I get that,

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happens.

01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tell them,
well, if you get there

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're in that
point of consciousness,

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.170 align:middle line:90%
it's not that nothing happens.

01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
It already has happened.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.700 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Intend something.

01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:52.399 align:middle line:90%
Go somewhere.

01:25:52.399 --> 01:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Have an experience.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
blocking all that out.

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
They have this idea of what
it's supposed to be like.

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And unless that happens,
then nothing's happened yet.

01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they're there
in idle, sitting there

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:14.504 align:middle line:90%
with their mind closed.

01:26:14.504 --> 01:26:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So they are the problem
why nothing's happening.

01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:23.132 align:middle line:84%
It's not that somebody has to
go pull them out of their body,

01:26:23.132 --> 01:26:24.298 align:middle line:90%
they need another technique.

01:26:24.298 --> 01:26:25.690 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's the magic word?

01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:26.850 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to do it with
your head facing north?

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
You go through all
of these things,

01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's not
really what you need.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, go to that still,
quiet space, have an intent.

01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But please, have an
intent that you can then

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:43.700 align:middle line:84%
check to see whether it's
actually having an effect,

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.720 align:middle line:90%
whether it's real.

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
That you're not just making it
up, that you're imagining it.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.250 align:middle line:84%
That's how you can
tell the difference.

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:50.959 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can't
tell the difference.

01:26:50.959 --> 01:26:52.999 align:middle line:84%
That's probably another
good point to talk about.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you tell the difference?

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to do
evidential things.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So it may be
statistical evidence.

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
You may have to do it
over and over again,

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.700 align:middle line:90%
but you can collect evidence.

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Go someplace that
you've never been,

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
look around, see what it looks
like, and then go look it up.

01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Go get Google Maps
and look at it

01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and see if that's
what it looks like.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Go visit some individuals.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Call them up and say,
what were you doing?

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Were you just sitting in the
kitchen having a conversation?

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to do these kinds of
things to collect evidence,

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise
you never know.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.035 align:middle line:84%
Said, OK, I had this adventure,
but I just made it all up.

01:27:31.035 --> 01:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
It's just in my mind.

01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:33.326 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course
it's in your mind.

01:27:33.326 --> 01:27:34.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to
be in your mind.

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But to know whether or not
your intent is traveling,

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
your intent is
getting that data,

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that real data, or whether
it's just your intellect

01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
making up data to
satisfy a need,

01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:53.460 align:middle line:90%
those are two different things.

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that you
can tell the difference

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
is by doing things
that are evidential.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.160 align:middle line:90%
That will then convince you.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done enough
things that, gee, I

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have known that
any other way other than I

01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:07.925 align:middle line:84%
got that information,
then you know,

01:28:07.925 --> 01:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
well, here's the state I was in.

01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Then you try to duplicate that.

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
If your evidence
comes back and says,

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
nope, we weren't
even home, then you

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
try to say, well, let's
not do it that way again.

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.850 align:middle line:90%
It's trial and error.

01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:23.540 align:middle line:84%
You have to practice
at these altered states

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
with your intent, with
focusing it, how you focus it.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.765 align:middle line:90%
Adjust your tools, practice.

01:28:28.765 --> 01:28:29.640 align:middle line:90%
You get better at it.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Takes a long time.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
this for 35 years,

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
so that gives me an advantage
over somebody that's just

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:38.570 align:middle line:90%
been doing it for 25 years.

01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You get better at it with
practice, like anything else.

01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's like a skill,
and it becomes something

01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:46.620 align:middle line:90%
that you practice.

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.480 align:middle line:10%
And the more you practice,
the more you're able to do it.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.570 align:middle line:10%
For instance, we have one
exercise in our Gateway Voyage

01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:55.120 align:middle line:10%
where people go out
and they actually

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.750 align:middle line:10%
practice moving,
changing their awareness

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:59.590 align:middle line:10%
as they're out in the
natural environment

01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:01.990 align:middle line:10%
so that we can help
people to realize

01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:05.220 align:middle line:10%
that all of these ranges of
experience are available to us

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.420 align:middle line:10%
at any time.

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But what I think begins
to happen, for me anyway,

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a more
subtle form of communication

01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:16.020 align:middle line:84%
that happens, that you
begin to pay attention more.

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.612 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
more a matter of attention

01:29:18.612 --> 01:29:20.710 align:middle line:90%
than it is anything else.

01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:23.710 align:middle line:10%
You get little insights,
maybe little intuitions,

01:29:23.710 --> 01:29:26.560 align:middle line:10%
answers to questions that
seem to come out of nowhere.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.280 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe somebody
will say something,

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.349 align:middle line:10%
and you realize that that's
not just that person talking.

01:29:32.349 --> 01:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a larger
piece of information

01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:34.806 align:middle line:90%
that's coming through.

01:29:34.806 --> 01:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to move
through life like that,

01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
then you also understand
that our world

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
is speaking to us all the
time, if we will pay attention.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And therein lies the
difficulty, is paying attention.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of fun to be able
to move into other dimensions.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:52.037 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

01:29:52.037 --> 01:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But I think the real
challenge is, how do we

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
begin to integrate
that so that we

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.970 align:middle line:84%
are on a frequency,
a wavelength where

01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
we are truly present
but also truly

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:07.480 align:middle line:84%
aware of other information
that may be coming to us?

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:11.020 align:middle line:84%
There's something very
wonderful about this reality.

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.550 align:middle line:90%
We are here for a purpose.

01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
it's very important

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that as we look at
out-of-body issues

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that we also look very
carefully at in-body issues

01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:25.960 align:middle line:84%
so that we really value
what's going on in this world.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>In the totality
of all the universe

01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and all the dimensions
of which we occupy,

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
this is very brief, very
momentary, very minuscule,

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and yet not unimportant
in the grand totality

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:48.260 align:middle line:84%
of everything, which is the true
nature of who we really are.

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:52.290 align:middle line:84%
In a metaphor, my
little finger is

01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:57.540 align:middle line:84%
pretty small in the totality
of who I am in total,

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:59.420 align:middle line:90%
but I'd hate to lose it.

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of people are
looking for real answers.

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:03.990 align:middle line:90%
They're tired of more beliefs.

01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They're tired of being told to
believe this and to read this.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:11.687 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know based
on their own experiences.

01:31:11.687 --> 01:31:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this does.

01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
It opens up that potential
to actually see yourself

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
beyond your physical
body, to prove to yourself

01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:24.600 align:middle line:84%
your own immortality, which
is incredibly powerful, just

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.650 align:middle line:90%
that in itself.

01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:28.560 align:middle line:90%
It's mind boggling.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.210 align:middle line:10%
That often just awakens people
spiritually because then

01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:35.930 align:middle line:10%
they begin to really focus
on their quest or their path

01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:39.640 align:middle line:10%
inward beyond the
physical world.

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe your beliefs
have been shifted

01:31:41.710 --> 01:31:44.690 align:middle line:84%
or your initial fears
have been dissolved away.

01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
The tools have been offered
to focus your intention

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.320 align:middle line:90%
and to satisfy your curiosity.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time where we
can find our own answers

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and explore what is
beyond the physical.
