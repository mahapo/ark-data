>> My name is Eileen McKusick,
and I'm a health and human

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:90%
potential researcher.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I started a restaurant with
my family when I was 20,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and I was surrounded
by sugar and stress,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and really ruined my back,
really ruined my health.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up realizing that
I was much more interested

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
in natural health and healing
than I was in washing dishes,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:90%
even in my own restaurant.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:10%
So I went to massage
therapy school

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:10%
and ended up picking up
a set of tuning forks

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:10%
for healing, very early
on in my practice,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:10%
and started making
discoveries with them.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And my clients would
come back the next week

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say, hey, do that
sound thing on me again.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It got me out of pain, or it
helped me to sleep better,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
or I haven't fought
with my spouse all week.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Do that again.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So working on other people
and seeing the benefits

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that they were getting, that's
what kept me going with it.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But even as a giver,
I was still suffering

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
mid-back pain, a
sense of burnout,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
a kind of low level angst,
poverty consciousness, debt.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But in 2010, I taught my
first group of students

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
how to do the method and then
they started working on me.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And through my experience
receiving biofield tuning,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I really healed
all of the things

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
that I was suffering
and struggling with.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It's been very transformational
for me to help get me

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
to that place that I set off to
find when I was 18, of health,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
of freedom, of comfort in my
own body, abundant mentality,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that
everybody wants to have

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
but we can't get to because we
have trauma responses locked

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:90%
We have false beliefs.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of
things that are in the way.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that
sound could really

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
release and digest and
integrate those experiences

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately lead to the
liberation that I was seeking.

I'm trained as a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
incorporated ayurvedic
medicine into my practice.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But when I started working
with patients with multiple

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
sclerosis, and
Parkinson's disease,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
debilitating conditions,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that even with those
recommendations for health--

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
like through the supplements,
the diet, through exercise--

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
that there was still
some realm of healing

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't able to tap into.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure out
at first why that was.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while to figure out
that the piece that was missing

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:90%
was the sound healing.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I brought that
into it, what I saw

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
was everything else
we did went further.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
It gained a kind of potency
that pushed everything

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to a completely new
level of healing.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But that was the first time that
I started scratching my head

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and really going, wait a
minute, why does this work?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Why does this work on
such a profound level?

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And so as I went
deeper and deeper

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
into this question of
what exactly is sound,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really
satisfied with the answer

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
until I started to go into
the world of quantum physics.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And sound, from
that perspective,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
is energy vibrating.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly
the way that that's

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
described from thousands
and thousands of years ago.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
And to practice medicine
or any healing tradition

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
coming from that
fundamental nature,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and applying it to us
as vibratory beings,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the most powerful
tools available on the planet.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is John Stuart Reid.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I am an acoustic
physics scientist.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And an event occurred in 1996,
which totally changed my life,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
because, well, my
daddy and I had

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:90%
traveled in Egypt many times.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We were both fascinated by
ancient Egyptian technologies,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:90%
particularly.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first
opportunity that we actually

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
had of being in
the King's Chamber

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid all alone.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinarily resonant.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And so one particular experiment
that I wanted to conduct

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:90%
was a cymatics experiment.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:10%
For those of you who are
not familiar with cymatics,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:10%
it's simply the study
of visible sound.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:10%
Whenever you have sound
and you have a membrane,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:10%
there has to be what's termed
a cymatic pattern imprinted

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:10%
onto that membrane.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
cymatic patterns

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.245 align:middle line:90%
are everywhere around us.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Anyway, we set up this
really novel experiment to make

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
visible the resonances in
that granite sarcophagus.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I placed a small speaker there.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And about 20 minutes
into the experiment,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, on the
surface of the membrane,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
came what appeared to be an
ancient Egyptian hieroglyph.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was an astonishing
moment in my life.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:10%
This hieroglyph was
the djed pillar.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Symbolically, it's the
backbone of the God Osiris.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And this cymatic djed
pillar wasn't static.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It was snaking
really dynamically

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the membrane.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:10%
And every time we
changed the frequency,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:10%
a new hieroglyph would
appear in the sand.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
At the time when this
was all happening,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really even think
about how is this possible.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But what happened, which proved
to be a great gift actually,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
was that three weeks
before going out

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt for this
research mission,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I quite badly
injured my lower back

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and I was in excruciating pain.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I had been to a physiotherapist
a couple of times,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
but nothing had really
touched this pain.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, to cut a
long story short,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
about 20 minutes
into this experiment,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly realized that there
was no pain in my lower back.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.720 align:middle line:84%
The pain had just
completely vanished.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to
the UK, I immediately

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
begun research into cymatics,
the study of visible sound.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But also, I've been studying
the biological mechanisms

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
that underpin sound
therapy and music medicine.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
How does sound trigger the
body's healing response

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
naturally and provide
many benefits to health?

for health and transformation
for over 40 years.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
If you examine the
different tenants

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
of the different spiritual
traditions on our planet,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
you find that they have a
commonality, an understanding

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
that life, the universe, and
everything was created solely

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
through the power of the word.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said,
"Let there be light."

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Sound creating light.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning was the word.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu tradition,
they say Nada Brahma.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:90%
The world is sound.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
All these different
traditions talk about

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
sound as being the original
creative force on the planet.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question is, how
does sound heal and transform?

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that really
surprised me when I started

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
doing my research into sound is
just how much sound healing was

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
prevalent in all of
the major cultures.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me,
was really stunning,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
because if we all
knew this at one time,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
how was it possible that
something so important

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
was forgotten by almost
the entire planet?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people now recognize
that pyramids in general are

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
thought of as
resurrection machines.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the healing
aspects of sound

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
for the ancient
Egyptians, research

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:84%
shows very strongly
that they had

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
a significant
acoustic knowledge.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's sad in
many ways that it

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't go on to be shared
with the rest of the world.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:84%

of new Renaissance now.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm the founder and CEO of
the Consciousness and Healing

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Initiative.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And as a PhD student and
as a young investigator

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
of biofield science,
I was always

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:90%
drawn to the power of sound.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
challenges for me,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
both as a student
and a researcher,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
in the areas of
mind-body healing

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
was a fundamental
arm's length pushback

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
against the
exploration of things

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:90%
like consciousness and energy.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
There is still an overabundance
of what we call materialism

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in science, that is
going with the belief

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are only
our physical bodies

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and that it's only physical
medicine that matters.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the data
does not support this.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And even the rise of
my field of research--

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:90%
psychoneuroimmunology--

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
showed us that our minds,
our emotions, our spirit

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:84%
have powerful effects
on our health.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we are with
this field of biofield science.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the biofield
is simply a term

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that we use in science to
describe this energetic body

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that has been described by
so many Indigenous wisdom

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%
traditions across the world.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And the physical body
and the energetic body

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:90%
are not separate.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:90%
They are actually connected.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:84%
This is really the bridge
for us to understand

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
how consciousness itself can
affect the healing process.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And we study the
biofield in many ways.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that we
study it is through sound.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
These days, many of us
are going to sound baths.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
We may go to gong immersions.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We may go to Tibetan
bowl healing.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:90%
We may practice mantra.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So how do we understand
that scientifically?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we need
to look at the whole

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of biofield science to help us
understand what the power is

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:90%
of sound for healing.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> This whole division between
science and spirituality is

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
kind of unique to
Western culture.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's very simple.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
The energy and energy
medicine is electricity

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
where our body has
an electrical system

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:90%
that we aren't told about.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a
situation of not seeing

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:90%
the forest for the trees.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Because most people understand
that their brainwaves are

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
electric, that their heart
is electrically driven,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that their blood
carries a charge.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And what this all
points to is the fact

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that we have electric
current running through us.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And anything that has an
electric current running

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
through it has a
magnetic field around it.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more
elegant and efficient

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:84%
to work at the level of the
electrical system in the field

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
than it is to try to
do it in the body.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.272 align:middle line:90%
The field is causative.

00:13:02.272 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And the body gets built on
the blueprint of the field.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is going
on in the field

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to be going
on in the body,

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:90%
especially as we get older.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:10%
This idea that our biography
becomes our biology

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:10%
because it's all written
in our field and our field

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:10%
is informing our body.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.867 align:middle line:84%
So I'm waiting for people to
start waking up to the fact

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, you have
electric current in your body

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and you have a magnetic
field around you.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And that when we work
in this magnetic field,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that's when the magic
can really happen.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything is in
a state of vibration.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in
a state of motion.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Everything is sound.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:90%
This includes our body.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Every organ, every
bone, every tissue,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
every part of our body
is in a state of motion,

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
is in a state of vibration.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we are in
a state of health,

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:90%
we say we are in sound health.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We're this incredible
orchestra that's

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
playing the symphony of the
self in a natural harmonic

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:90%
resonant frequency.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if the second
violin player loses their sheet

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:90%
music?

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:90%
They begin to play out of tune.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, the entire
orchestra is sounding off.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the basic
ideas of sound to heal

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
is simply to restore to
the string player who's

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
lost their sheet music
the correct music,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to basically somehow
encode within the body

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
the correct resonant frequencies
to have it vibrating back

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:90%
into a state of health.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Tuning forks work with the
physics principles of resonance

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
and entrainment.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So everything in the
body is in motion.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything in
motion makes waves,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and waves propagate
off the body.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've all had the experience
of getting a good vibe off

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
of somebody or a bad
vibe off of somebody.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And these waves
that come off of us

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:90%
are a very, very high frequency.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:90%
They're very low amplitude.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
So we can't really hear them.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the tuning fork will
actually resonate and reflect

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.400 align:middle line:84%
whatever tonal information it
is encountering that's being

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:90%
produced by the body.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So early on, I remember my
first experience with this

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
was with a massage client
who had a sore shoulder.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I activated
a tuning fork

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and held it over
the sore shoulder,

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
the tone really changed
and it sounded sharp,

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
whereas when I was holding
it over the shoulder that

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
wasn't in pain, it
sounded very neutral.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept on activating
it and holding it

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
in the place that sounded sharp.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And after just a little
bit, the tone changed.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
It relaxed.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And it started to sound
like the other shoulder.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And when he got up off the
table and he rotated his arm,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
he said, oh my, God,
all the pain is gone.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
[DING]

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So the tuning fork
will initially

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
resonate with whatever
distortion it's encountering,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually a consequence
of some kind of tension

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Very often old trauma
responses are locked as freezes

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's these
patterns of tension

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that create
inflammation, basically

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
a traffic jam of electrical
movement that has become frozen

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and isn't able to be
in a state of flow.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So the tuning fork
gently guides the body

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:90%
into a more coherent expression.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We're basically
self-tuning instruments

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that will fix ourselves
when given the opportunity.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And that led to the
discovery of what

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I call the biofield anatomy
map and this observation

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that the field
around us is actually

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
where our memories appear
to be stored, and stored

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:90%
in a very specific fashion.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:90%
For example, sadness.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Every time we feel
sad, that record gets

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:90%
stored off of our left shoulder.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So I was finding people
that were coming in

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
with left shoulder pain,
left shoulder injuries had

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
a lot of undigested, unexpressed
sadness in their memory banks,

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and that there was
weight to those feelings,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that there was mass there
that was weighing them down.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
every person who

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
came in that had
right hip issues

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
had a busy mind and a busy
body, and that they were always

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:84%
in kind of go mode and thinking
about their to-do lists.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It took me a little
while to learn

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that that particular
sound is alarm when

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:90%
it goes really sharp and high.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That low heavy tone,
that's depression.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
That when the fork starts
feeling and sounding like it

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
has a growl in it,
that's the inner critic

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
or the inner judge.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So the process is really like
dropping a needle on an album

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and reading the vibrational
record of a person's life, all

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:90%
of their experiences.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:90%
We put words on everything.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But really, everything is really
a waveform moving through us.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Every emotion is a waveform.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very pure language
that really all of nature

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:90%
speaks.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It's something I've
discovered in my research

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is that plants and
animals and humans

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
all speak the same
vibrational language.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So because the nature of
reality is actually just energy

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
vibrating, there are certain
vibratory codes then that are

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
there for helping human beings
heal the body, heal the mind,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
heal the emotions, and
really expand consciousness.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And those vibratory
codes are called mantras.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The mantra comes from a place
that is far beyond the mind.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
It's, essentially, a part of
us calling back to ourselves

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to be reunited back in that most
fundamental vibrational field

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
where we are without
our programs.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:90%
That is a mantra.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It's, essentially, just
a song from the soul

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
being sung to ourselves
calling us back home.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Mantras are literally sacred
sounds that connect us with

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:90%
certain qualities of divinity.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
These mantras were discovered
by rishis, or seers.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They learned it
through experience,

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
through the actual connection
with these divine vibrations.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They were able to capture what
that vibration was in a sound.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these
divine vibrations

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
are also depicted
in yantra form,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:84%
which are geometric
representations

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:90%
of that particular sound.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:10%
So this is just one
tradition in the way

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:10%
that we've described it.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.742 align:middle line:84%
But there are so
many traditions that

00:19:48.742 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
understood the power
of the sacred word

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:90%
and sacred sound making.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been in this
field for over 40 years,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and I have worked with all
sorts of amazing healing

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
instruments-- bowls,
bells, tuning forks, gongs,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of instruments, all
sorts of scientific instruments

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
designed to project
frequencies to you.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But the most powerful healing
instrument that I know

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
is the human voice.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And it really links back to
what ancient traditions have

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
taught us about the power
of sound making and a sense

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of really utilizing the power
of sound to connect with

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:90%
the divine.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
We see this, for example,
in mantra meditation

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and in bhakti singing, in
traditions like kirtan,

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
but also devotional
singing in the church.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
There's the sense that we
can bring together and cohere

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:84%
our energy, both by
ourselves and in groups,

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to really amplify our
connection with something

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:90%
greater than ourselves.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The last thing you
often feel like doing when

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:90%
you're depressed is singing.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Although, I will say that when
my mom died-- when I was 25,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:90%
she died of a brain tumor.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
She died within six
weeks of being diagnosed.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of
those lucky people

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:90%
who really had a great mom.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:90%
So it was very crushing.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I remember my
heart felt so heavy

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that it just wanted to pull
me face down onto the floor

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and I just wasn't
going to get up.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And what got me through
that was singing.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:84%
There were a few CDs
of songs that move me

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and I would sing at the
top of my lungs in the car,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:90%
in the shower, in my bedroom.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Just sing.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Just belt it out.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:84%
It was moving that
energy through my heart,

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
through my body, that got
me up and got me to move.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Music is very,
very, very powerful

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:90%
in its ability to move us.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, we just
feel shut down.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We can't express
ourselves with our voice.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%
There are so many practices.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And the first is,
honestly, just sighing.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Coming into the
body and allowing

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
for a nice release of any
stagnant energy to simply flow.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.795 align:middle line:90%
So we simply take a breath.

00:22:10.795 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES] Ha!

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES] And we exhale,
and we allow for that

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
sound to just travel through
the body and release.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
There's so many other ways
that we can make sound, too.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
We can simply take a
vowel or a seed mantra

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:90%
like om or any divine sound--

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:90%
amen, so many different ones.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
sounds that we can make--

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
babies, the elderly--
we make it all the time,

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
consciously or unconsciously,
and that is the hum.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So I want to tell you
how to consciously hum.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're with me, I want you
to just check yourself out

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:90%
What are you feeling?

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:90%
So you have your lips closed.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.556 align:middle line:90%
Take a nice deep breath.

00:23:02.556 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And now just check yourself
out, being in silence.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
See if you notice any
differences in the way

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:90%
you feel.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, myself,
that I'm feeling

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
a little bit light-headed
and a lot more relaxed.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you hum,
there are all sorts

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of physiological
benefits that occur,

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
including reduction of
heart rate and respiration.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Your blood pressure goes down.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
You get the release
of melatonin,

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
which is wonderful for enhancing
sleep and circadian rhythms.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
You get the release of oxytocin,
that wonderful feel-good

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:90%
hormone that occurs.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's an incredible
natural pharmaceutical tool

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:90%
that everybody can use.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people think that
the sound-making is just about

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:90%
catharsis and release.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:90%
It's more than that.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:90%
It is a clarifying practice.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It is a cohering practice.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's freely
available to all of us.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:84%
We know now from the
research that even things

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:90%
like devotional sound making--

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
for example, kirtan chanting,
when we compare those

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
with just listening
to music, can actually

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
decrease markers of cell aging
and promote health in the body.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:10%
>> There are so many benefits
that come from applying

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:10%
specific sound
frequencies to the body.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:10%
This idea that Pythagorus
had stated that music

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:10%
could be used in
place of medicine.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And after that
amazing experience

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had in the
Great Pyramid, how

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
was it that my back was
apparently miraculously healed

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
within only 20 minutes
of making sound?

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to study the
effects of sound frequencies

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:90%
and music on human blood.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And it consisted of
very simple experiments.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
We would take a test
tube of human blood

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in the lab incubator which
has a small speaker in it.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Then, 20 minutes of exposure
of the blood in the music

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:90%
incubator.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:10%
And it was hard to believe the
results that we were seeing.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Every type of music,
every genre of music

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:10%
that we played to the blood
produced a massive increase

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:10%
in the viability of
the red blood cells.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:90%
It was really astonishing.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The blood was being
super oxygenated.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when we know
that almost every healing

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
mechanism in the body
is supported by oxygen,

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:84%
so it becomes obvious that
it's a very, very important

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:90%
discovery that we've made.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And obviously it's one
of the many mechanisms

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that we now know is at work
in terms of health benefits

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
when we are immersed
in a sound environment.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, the
low frequencies

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:84%
can be readily
absorbed by our bodies,

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, have positive
effects not only on our blood,

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
but also on many other
aspects of our physiology.

low frequency environment

for anyone who has perhaps a
weak heart or poor respiration

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and not getting enough
oxygen into their body,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that low frequency sound can
actually counter that very,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

in gong baths,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, or
Tibetan bowl baths,

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
or crystal bowl baths,
these are real effects.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
They're real medical effects
and they can be measured.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So the future, I believe, is
very bright for sound therapy

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:90%
and for music medicine.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It is really important that
you do this on a regular basis.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you are working
with, the effects

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:84%
of the sound that you're
working with become cumulative.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a little bit one day,
it becomes more the next day.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It becomes more and more
profound and powerful.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it can become magical.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't even need a
PhD or an MD to do this sound

00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.850 align:middle line:90%
healing with others, right?

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.090 align:middle line:90%
You can get trained in it.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way for us to work
with sound and vibration

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
on the community level to up
level the vibration of healing

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:84%
in all of us in ways that
actually make a huge difference

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:90%
for mental health.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Lloyd Burrell.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:84%
In 2002, I answered a call
on my cell phone and I had

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
a reaction-- to I didn't
know what at the time--

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
debilitating symptoms
which lasted for years.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It was just like cell phone
next to my ear, intense pain,

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.255 align:middle line:90%
cell phone away, no pain.

00:28:38.255 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there was like
medium-term symptoms,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:84%
which were headaches,
chronic fatigue.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It got so bad I actually
went to see my doctor.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:10%
He did his tests
and stuff, and he

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:10%
said he could find
nothing wrong with me.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But once I understood that
there was a problem with

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields, because
that's what cell phones emit--

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:90%
these different frequencies--

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that's when I began to
look what I needed to do.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:10%
But there was nobody saying,
do this, this, and this,

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.407 align:middle line:10%
and you'll be fine.

00:29:11.407 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, I would have done it.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was either
the problem doesn't

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:84%
exist, or, yeah, the
problem exists, but there's

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:90%
no solution.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this
electromagnetic world.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:90%
We are electromagnetic beings.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And these man-made
electromagnetic

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:90%
fields impact everybody.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.920 align:middle line:10%
And I've never been one to say,
you know, burn the cell towers.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.915 align:middle line:90%
These things are too useful.

00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
They're too part of our
world now for that to happen.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
with the flow on it.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of strategies--
simple strategies like

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:84%
switching off your
Wi-Fi at night--

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
so how to stop it or mitigate
those adverse frequencies.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
hand, it's tapping

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:90%
into the beneficial energies.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:10%
This whole world, which is
this holistic approach, which

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:10%
acknowledges that we
are energetic beings,

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:10%
and soon as we acknowledge
that we're an energetic being,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:10%
then we're looking for
an energetic solution.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, to live
well in this world,

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:10%
be you energy sensitive
or EMF sensitive or not,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:10%
we need to have a
certain energy mastery,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.383 align:middle line:10%
and that is the way to health.

00:30:32.383 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm an accountant by
training, so I'm actually

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:84%
quite skeptical about
a lot of things.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe anybody.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But that search for
solutions carried on

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:90%
for years and years and years.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And it took me about 10 years
to get the better of this

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and say that I'm healed.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So it went from being
a curse to a blessing.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:10%
And so it's all
about, as Tesla said,

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:10%
"If you want to understand
the secrets of the universe,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:10%
think in terms of energy,
frequency, vibration,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:10%
and therein lies the key."

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:10%
We are actually kind
of walking antennas.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And we are reacting
to sound a bit

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:10%
like we are being impacted
by electromagnetic fields,

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.690 align:middle line:10%
whether we want to or not.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You get home and
you've had a bad day.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And you put some music on
and you'll get carried away.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If we experience music
that really moves us,

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that really touches
us emotionally,

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:84%
then what's happening in
our brain is that we are

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
automatically going to
be producing dopamine

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
We will also be
reducing or suppressing

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
the amount of cortisol
in our bodies.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, the stress
hormone cortisol is reduced

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and the happy hormone dopamine
is massively increased.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the music that
we particularly love

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
has the most beneficial
effect for us.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't want to get locked
into any one specific frequency

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.750 align:middle line:84%
as being the be all and end all
that will work for everyone.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We are all unique
vibratory beings.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Different frequencies can
work for different people.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And back when I was getting
my master's degree from Lesley

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
University, I had
a pile of papers

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:84%
about yo high that
were basically

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
different systems of using
sound and music for healing.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw that you
would have Dr. X who

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.770 align:middle line:84%
would be using a particular
set of frequencies for an organ

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and having great
success and Dr. Y

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.980 align:middle line:84%
using a completely different
set of frequencies.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that they
weren't in agreement.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a really deep
state of intellectual angst.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting there with
my head in my hands going,

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
how can this be?

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And I heard an inner voice,
and the inner voice said,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
it is not only the
frequency of the sound

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:90%
that creates its effect.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
It is also the intention of
the person making and receiving

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:90%
the sound.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote down these words--

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
frequency plus intent
equals healing.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple
of subcorollaries

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.200 align:middle line:84%
about that, which
is vocalization

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.170 align:middle line:84%
making a sound plus
visualization visualizing

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:90%
something equals manifestation.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And the other one,
which is basically

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
even a little quicker, is sound
plus belief equals outcome.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the majority
of prayers on our planet

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.800 align:middle line:90%
are vocalized.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They're chanted,
whispered, spoken or sung.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So that is the idea
of the importance

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:90%
of intent or intentionality.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:10%
Nowadays, you have all
these different books,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:10%
whether it's Wayne Dyer doing
"The Power of Intention,"

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:10%
or Dr. Bruce Lipton and "The
Biology of Belief," or Dr. Joe

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:10%
Dispenza, "The Power
of the Placebo,"

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:22.409 align:middle line:10%
and Masaru Emoto who did these
brilliant photographs of water

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.500 align:middle line:10%
crystals that had
been exposed to not

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:10%
only different frequencies but
different intentionalities.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
pictures that he did

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
was water from the
Fujiwara Dam in Japan.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:10%
It was polluted and
it looked like mud.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he had a
Buddhist priest chant

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:84%
what is known as the heart
sutra over it for 20 minutes.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And he rephotographed the water.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:10%
And the water looked as pristine
and as perfect as a snowflake.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So water can resonate with all
sorts of different frequencies

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and with all sorts
of intentionalities.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.870 align:middle line:90%
How much of our body is water?

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:90%
A whole lot.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we can use
intentionalized sacred sound,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.070 align:middle line:84%
we can shift the vibratory field
of ourselves and of the planet

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the popular sayings
out there right now is that

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:84%
your vibe attracts
your experience.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I would make that
even simpler and say,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:90%
your vibe is your experience.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
That whatever you're vibing,
that's what your experience is.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
have this idea

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:45.370 align:middle line:84%
of when I have that made
or I'm paid off from debt,

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.200 align:middle line:90%
then I will feel a certain way.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:90%
That's backwards.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to generate
the feeling first.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Where we drop the tension,
the resistance, the stories

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and thinking that something
out there is going to heal me,

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
fix me, restore me-- no,
you have to feel it first.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You have to practice it.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And there is a gap
before it actually really

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:84%
shows up, enough to make people
do that 3 feet from gold thing

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and just quit because they
think it's not working.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But if they had just
gone a little further,

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:90%
the paydirt was about to happen.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that
seeing is believing.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But what I've really come to
see is that believing is seeing.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So you have to give
it to you first.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You're the only one
who can do that.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know in extreme cases
that can be extremely hard.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's where something
like sound healing

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:90%
can come in handy.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Because what I do
with biofield tuning,

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I help you to release
the tension that's

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:84%
stopping you from being
able to feel that way.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to need help.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:90%
You can go to a sound bath.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Even just hanging out, listening
to bowls can help you to relax.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:90%
You can go to a great concert.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Good live music really
shifts your state.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you
can do that's going

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:84%
to help you to relax
the tension that's

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:84%
holding these
patterns of the story

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is going to move you a long
way towards experiencing

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.920 align:middle line:90%
a better version of yourself.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all creative beings.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:84%
We're all manifesting
our reality.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And that manifestation
is from your vibration.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It's from what you're emitting.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And sound is perhaps
the easiest way

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:84%
to change our state of being,
because ultimately it's

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
about changing your
state of being.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
We've got all these different
frequencies, binaural beats

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and the solfeggio frequencies,
guided meditations.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:90%
So this stuff works.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's no time
like the present.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait for
whatever to happen.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Believe it.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:84%
All it requires is just
a little bit of effort.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I hear a lot is people

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.850 align:middle line:90%
say, I had no choice.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is so wrong, because
we've always got a choice.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
choices are hard.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:90%
But we've always got a choice.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we
might wonder, well,

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:84%
if my thoughts can create things
and my intentions are actually

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:84%
like sound vibrations
that are creating reality,

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.390 align:middle line:84%
then why is it that when I will
something, it doesn't happen,

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:84%
or when I use these
affirmations, nothing changes.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, often, it's because we may
be holding subconscious blocks

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in our field, where consciously
in our conscious mind

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
we're pretty clear
on what we want,

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:84%
but subconsciously we may
be holding old beliefs

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
or patterns that prevent
us from really aligning

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:90%
with that thing.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And a good way of
doing this and really

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
integrating the subconscious
mind and the energy of desire

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:84%
is to go back to the feeling and
say, OK, now what if I actually

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:90%
put myself there?

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I am in that house, on
that street, on that beach.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:90%
The sun is shining.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking out in the ocean.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:90%
How am I feeling right now?

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Because often, what
we're really wanting

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:29.020 align:middle line:84%
is a particular feeling state, a
sense of peace, a sense of joy,

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.360 align:middle line:90%
a sense of happiness.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So we want to align ourselves
with that state of being

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:90%
that we're tuning into.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, I bring myself
to that feeling

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.450 align:middle line:84%
of contentment and
peace because that

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.810 align:middle line:84%
is what will attract the
reality that I'm seeking.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.275 align:middle line:84%
And then be open to how it
actually shows up in your life.

00:39:51.275 --> 00:39:52.075 align:middle line:90%
Be curious.

00:39:52.075 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest reason why it's
not so simple to just think

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:84%
yourself into a better space
is that feelings are part

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.310 align:middle line:90%
of the equation as well.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So we experience the
electric aspect of ourselves

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.750 align:middle line:84%
maybe as more mental,
as more thoughts,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and our emotions
as more magnetic.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But what I find in
most people, as I'm

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.540 align:middle line:84%
combing through their
fields and their memories,

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is really a kind of
emotional constipation

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.270 align:middle line:84%
of all of the different
emotions that they've judged,

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that they've resisted,
that they've held in.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is sound
that has never come out.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Tears that haven't been shed.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Truth that hasn't been spoken.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Shame that hasn't been felt
and digested and responded to.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So a big part of
my work with tuning

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:84%
is finding these
emotions that have never

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:50.310 align:middle line:84%
had the opportunity
for that wave to break

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and supporting the body
in feeling, and digesting,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.510 align:middle line:90%
and integrating that emotion.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And then that energy
goes back into flow.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a sound that
people, oftentimes,

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:84%
don't really look at in terms
of its significance on our life,

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's the sound that comes
from our subconscious internal

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:84%
dialogue that is at
play all the time.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And people don't tend
to look at that as sound

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's not coming
from the outside.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.080 align:middle line:90%
But you're hearing it, right?

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the majority of
that dialogue is negative

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's having a negative
impact on our lives.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It is a sound coming from
deep within the mind,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:84%
so deep that we call it
the subconscious mind.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And it carries so many of
our programs from childhood.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the fundamental
goals of human existence

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
is, essentially,
to stop listening

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to those sounds that give us
our programs, the programs that

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:59.420 align:middle line:84%
are harming us, and to tune in
to the sound of who we really

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.810 align:middle line:90%
are beyond those programs.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we can tune in to
that, it changes everything.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It changes the body.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:90%
It changes the mind.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:90%
It changes our relationships.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Because sound encodes
human experience.

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> A big part for me of
being a sound healer,

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:84%
a sound therapist,
a sound researcher,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is paying really close
attention to people's-- the tone

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:84%
of their voices, the
words that they're saying,

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and reflecting back to them how
they are creating their life

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:84%
with the story that
they're telling.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And so really it is by our word
that we make ourselves sick

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%
or we make ourselves well.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And what comes out of
our mouth, in many cases,

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
what goes into it.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:84%
What are you saying
and how are you

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:56.310 align:middle line:84%
using the creative power of
your word to limit yourself,

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to trap yourself, to reinforce
a story that isn't working?

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a quote that I
really love from a fellow

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.640 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Charles Capps.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
"I have told my people,
they can have what they say,

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
but my people keep
saying what they have."

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And that sums up
an awful lot right

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:21.350 align:middle line:84%
there-- is what are you
speaking into being?

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a deep connection
with the emotion of fear

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and what it does
vibrationally for our energy.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Fear is, of course,
a natural emotion,

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's a reason
why we have it.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It's related to our
instinctual sense of survival.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why if we see a giant
saber-toothed tiger baring

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.835 align:middle line:84%
its claws at us, we think,
oh, I better do something.

00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:45.160 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I don't
want to get eaten.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately,
because we're so primed

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:84%
for fear, what can
happen sometimes

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is paradoxically it can
actually limit our life energy.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we're
bombarded with information

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:84%
all the time that
triggers our brain

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
into thinking negatively and
creating negative realities

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we continue to
move with a fear response

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.180 align:middle line:84%
throughout our life, we're
literally seeing the world

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.620 align:middle line:90%
through tunnel vision, right?

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.650 align:middle line:84%
That means we don't see all
of the possibilities or even

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.490 align:middle line:90%
reality for what it is.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:90%
So how do we work with fear?

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.220 align:middle line:84%
We honor the vibration
of fear when it comes up,

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.810 align:middle line:84%
but then we continue
to ask ourselves,

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:90%
what am I really afraid of?

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And we get down to
the root of what

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.903 align:middle line:84%
it is that we're most afraid
of and then we work with it.

00:44:34.903 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
ways to work with it.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.750 align:middle line:84%
There are energy
psychology practices.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There are more traditional
psychotherapy-type practices.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when we dive into
what am I really afraid of,

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:84%
we realize the
fear is irrational.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And we realize, oh, I don't
need to be afraid of that.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, super, now I can
liberate my energy.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be
afraid of that thing

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.340 align:middle line:84%
because that's not the
reality that I'm going

00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.510 align:middle line:90%
to be creating for myself.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember these four
pillars of sound healing.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Everything is vibration.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Intent is powerful.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.018 align:middle line:84%
We are all unique,
vibratory beings.

00:45:11.018 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth one, which we
talked about a little bit,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:90%
is that silence is golden.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to check
yourself out and be in silence.

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Just spend a moment, because
it's really in the silence

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that the true power
of the sound occurs.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Silence is the yin
to the yang of sound.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There's times where I have
vast moments where I'm not

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.720 align:middle line:90%
thinking during my meditation.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.700 align:middle line:84%
There's times where everything
actually is kind of blank.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:90%
There's no thought.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:90%
It's complete silence.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.905 align:middle line:84%
But I know I still exist,
even in that silence.

00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:54.190 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We're always
back to this being.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:90%
We overcomplicate things.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But really all that matters
is the here and now,

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.130 align:middle line:90%
being in the moment.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:07.900 align:middle line:90%
It's an inner journey.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why every
morning, I get up,

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's like half
an hour, an hour

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.460 align:middle line:90%
of energy work-- every morning.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many ways to access
those vibrations of divinity

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that are all around us, and
ultimately, really part of us.

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So many forms of devotional
sound making, so many forms

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of meditation, of prayer.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The data is very
clear that when we

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.610 align:middle line:84%
work with our subtle
vibrations in these ways,

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.090 align:middle line:84%
we can foster powerful healing
effects for ourselves--

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.970 align:middle line:90%
mind, body, and spirit.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
The process then takes us into
a more expanded consciousness

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.290 align:middle line:84%
where we may be able
to come into greater

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:84%
contact with the
all, with the pada,

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:59.480 align:middle line:84%
with the true nature of sound,
which is consciousness itself.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was first
learning ayurveda,

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:08.150 align:middle line:84%
the hardest concept for me to
understand was, what is ether?

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
started really studying

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:84%
the science of sound
that it finally

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:14.720 align:middle line:90%
dawned on me what ether is.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:84%
We have this medium
in space that

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:22.280 align:middle line:84%
is filled with this
substance called ether,

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.890 align:middle line:90%
or Akash in Sanskrit.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It's this medium that
connects absolutely everything

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.080 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.300 align:middle line:90%
We are all swimming in it.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.220 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected to it.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.580 align:middle line:90%
And it propagates vibration.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It propagates waves.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like the internet
system for the entire cosmos.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And sound is its
language, meaning

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:54.300 align:middle line:84%
if you want to communicate
with everything everywhere,

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:84%
you do that through vibratory
sound codes that can

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:03.060 align:middle line:90%
be transmitted through ether.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And the people who figured
this out and figured out

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.700 align:middle line:84%
how to connect to
that substance and how

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to talk in that substance,
we call them enlightened,

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.260 align:middle line:84%
or we call them the yogis,
or the saints and siddhas.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And we consider what they were
able to do as supernatural.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It's why science
can't figure it out

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:84%
because we don't study
science in ether.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.870 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to, essentially,
go in to that space,

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:35.170 align:middle line:84%
connect with everything
everywhere, and then send

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.500 align:middle line:90%
a vibratory code.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And that code would come
back and be answered by life.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
seemed like a miracle.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply the
science of Akash.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a physician, if I was
able to somehow teach people

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.350 align:middle line:84%
how to connect to that, even
if it was just momentarily--

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.570 align:middle line:84%
maybe even for a
few seconds a day--

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.390 align:middle line:84%
through their mantra
meditation practice,

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.980 align:middle line:90%
how would their life change?

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.800 align:middle line:84%
What miracles would
they experience

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their physical
health, their mental health,

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and probably most
importantly, our relationships

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:14.970 align:middle line:90%
with each other?

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the ether,
the quintessence is one.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It is the one fabric that
all of life is woven from.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's science.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of matter.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.110 align:middle line:90%
And it is all connected.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's been removed
from our cosmological story.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
everything is ether

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that is continually
giving rise to creations

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and then they dissolve back.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The ether also contains
the geometric patterns

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.320 align:middle line:90%
that everything is built on.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Every single atom,
molecule structure

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:84%
has an underlying geometric
template that is in the ether,

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that matter then
attaches itself to.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we feel like we're
separate from everything.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize
that we're woven

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.730 align:middle line:84%
from the fabric of the one
and that we're all connected

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.310 align:middle line:90%
to everything that is.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the ancient
mantras coming from India,

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.100 align:middle line:84%
whether they're Sanskrit
or Tamil mantras,

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:19.600 align:middle line:84%
will oftentimes begin
with the sound "om."

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a sound that is embedded so
deeply within nature that it's

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:30.920 align:middle line:84%
part of the very birthplace,
you could say, of life itself.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So for me, when
I go to the ocean

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just walking by
myself, not speaking,

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I can hear the sound "om"
in the waves of the ocean.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the ocean is my
temple, because it reverberates

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:90%
that primordial sound of life.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you like, it is the
sound of nature that we need

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:90%
to bathe in.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a frequency that is a
very important frequency called

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.950 align:middle line:90%
the Schumann Resonance.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It is the electromagnetic
field of the Earth.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And one great way of
being, if you like,

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.570 align:middle line:84%
resonating in the
field of nature

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.950 align:middle line:90%
is simply to take a walk.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.630 align:middle line:90%
We forget to do that.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It's often said that
the biggest aura wins.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
aura is the Earth.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:10%
And so when we come
out into nature,

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.000 align:middle line:10%
whether it's with the trees,
with the ocean, with a lake,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.140 align:middle line:10%
and we simply sit in silent
reverence for a moment,

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.830 align:middle line:10%
we begin to be informed by
the greater biofield, which

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:48.020 align:middle line:10%
is the Earth herself and
all the creatures around it.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So grounding in
earthing practices

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.060 align:middle line:90%
are very, very powerful.

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.500 align:middle line:84%
We place our feet, if we
can, barefoot onto the Earth

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.490 align:middle line:90%
herself.

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment to breathe
and energetically connect.

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a very,
very powerful way

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to feel and connect
vibrationally with our field

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and with everything around us.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I first became
electrically hypersensitive,

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.780 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like a curse, it
seemed like the worst thing

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.040 align:middle line:90%
that could happen to me.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get on with
my life, raise my kids,

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:84%
go on holiday, have a good
time like everybody else.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized
over time, wow,

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.160 align:middle line:90%
what a beautiful gift this is.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And this sensitivity enables me
to connect to what's important.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's nature, but it's so
much more than nature.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's this intelligent
force which

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.480 align:middle line:84%
is out there, that's the
best explanation I have,

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.490 align:middle line:90%
this universal consciousness.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The true sound
of healing is love.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And if there were
an intention that

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.830 align:middle line:84%
should be projected
on any sound you make,

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:06.230 align:middle line:84%
whether it is a hum, a mantra,
or a song that you're singing,

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.650 align:middle line:84%
it's the energy of
love, the energy

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of gratitude and appreciation.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:10%
When we begin to breathe
deeply and we feel gratitude

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and appreciation, when we
breathe in through our heart--

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of this is due
to the work of Heartmath--

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.020 align:middle line:10%
we get a synchronization
of our heart

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and our brain, or
heart-brain coherence.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Vibration is the
medicine of the future.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And science is
continuously evolving.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:45.470 align:middle line:84%
60 years ago, if I
told a patient, or even

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:49.730 align:middle line:84%
a fellow scientist, that I think
that our emotions can really

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.850 align:middle line:84%
affect our health, our emotions
can affect the progression

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:57.440 align:middle line:84%
of disease and even potentially
the onset of a disease,

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.710 align:middle line:90%
I would have been laughed at.

00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't believe that
the mind and the immune system

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:84%
were even connected
60 years ago.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.930 align:middle line:84%
My home field of study,
psychoneuroimmunology,

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:11.220 align:middle line:90%
did not even exist.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So we see that as
medicine and science

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and scientific
discoveries evolve,

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.730 align:middle line:84%
we learn more and more about our
fundamental healing capacities,

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:middle line:84%
because science is a
process of discovery

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.680 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes rediscovery.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen, over the last
several years, a greater

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.490 align:middle line:84%
openness to exploring
the nature of vibration

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.980 align:middle line:84%
among even some of our
mainstream colleagues.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're finding all of these
ways that sound is starting

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:41.070 align:middle line:90%
to pop up in medicine.

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And what really
surprised me when

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I started bringing in mantra
meditation with my patients

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.830 align:middle line:84%
was actually just how
receptive they were.

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Patients are
desperate to change.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you give them a
lifeboat like mantra meditation

00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that begins to start changing
their experiences of their body

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and starts to shift negative
mental patterns that

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.410 align:middle line:84%
may have been imprisoning
them for their entire life,

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.490 align:middle line:84%
they're committed
to their journey.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm seeing more and
more of the Eastern traditions

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:15.110 align:middle line:90%
emerging.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't even say that
they're just from the East.

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:21.070 align:middle line:84%
They're really the traditions
around the world that

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:25.120 align:middle line:84%
are associated with a
deeper connection to nature

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and a deeper
connection to a broader

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:31.310 align:middle line:90%
spectrum of human being.

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
emerging out of necessity.

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Western-trained physician.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I know the limits
of my education.

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the fact that I
spent decades studying to not

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.950 align:middle line:84%
be able to answer
questions in front of me,

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.610 align:middle line:84%
but that is the
reality of today.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:52.150 align:middle line:84%
As most of the time,
necessity becomes

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.220 align:middle line:90%
the mother of invention.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And out of that
necessity, we are finally

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.590 align:middle line:84%
starting to embrace some of
the ancient traditions that

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:06.580 align:middle line:84%
give us the wisdom in
how to live in balance--

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in balance with our
planet, in balance

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.880 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and
most importantly,

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.490 align:middle line:90%
in balance with ourselves.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole reason why I
talk about sound medicine is

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:24.460 align:middle line:84%
because I believe in that
possibility of us living

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.920 align:middle line:84%
to our absolute
fullest potential.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we
are at a pivotal point

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:36.390 align:middle line:84%
in our evolutionary
development on this planet.

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:40.200 align:middle line:84%
On many levels, it is
very, very problematic

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and challenging
because so many people

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.590 align:middle line:90%
are divided against each other.

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But we need to evolve with
the energy of appreciation,

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:54.780 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of love, with
the energy of compassion.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.770 align:middle line:90%
We have a choice.

00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.280 align:middle line:84%
We are all unique
vibratory beings.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.870 align:middle line:90%
We are all different.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we are all one.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.480 align:middle line:84%
This oneness has a name
in the Hindu tradition.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called Advaita, which
simply means non-duality.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
think the same way.

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:15.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
sound the same way.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
talk the same way.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:21.720 align:middle line:84%
We need to just be at one
with love in our hearts

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and basically attuned
to the divine.

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> But we've all been very
programmed for self-loathing.

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It's really in everyone.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big part of what's
wrong with the human family is

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that people have internalized
this self-loathing,

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and then that kind of spills
out into the world around them.

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:44.490 align:middle line:84%
There's also this
very poisonous story

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that most people
have internalized

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:47.940 align:middle line:90%
that they're not worthy.

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:50.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what I found,
as a practitioner,

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:53.820 align:middle line:84%
was that the kernel of every
dysfunction that people came in

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.240 align:middle line:84%
with was some kind of
story of unworthiness

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.130 align:middle line:84%
where they were
blocking the life force

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.680 align:middle line:84%
from flowing through
that part of them

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.920 align:middle line:84%
because they were in
judgment of their worthiness.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.050 align:middle line:84%
This is something I
call a mind virus.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:08.340 align:middle line:90%
It isn't even self.

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a program that's
been put into you

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to make you powerless,
to make you feel guilty,

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:14.290 align:middle line:90%
not good enough.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we are mentally
abusing ourselves,

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.600 align:middle line:84%
then we are mentally
abusing creation.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And we're part of the problem.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You are a drop of God.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:26.950 align:middle line:90%
You are a drop of light.

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:28.810 align:middle line:90%
You are a drop of Earth.

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:31.270 align:middle line:90%
You are a miracle.

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And we also have had at least
five generations of trauma--

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:41.000 align:middle line:84%
wars, and all kinds of stuff
has been happening in the world.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have generations of
dysfunctional trauma responses

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.570 align:middle line:90%
coming down the line.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing is that
many people are being called--

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I call it the karmic
cleanup crew--

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to heal the trauma
within themselves,

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to heal the trauma
within their lineage,

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to emerge into
the potential of their soul

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and the potential that this time
that we're in, where there's

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:09.250 align:middle line:84%
so much light and so much
potential for all of us,

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:13.010 align:middle line:84%
to really step into
embodiment and empowerment.

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think people feel
called along that path.

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that sound
is an incredible vehicle

00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:22.550 align:middle line:90%
to help us to get there.

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It does appear worse than
it is because things are coming

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.580 align:middle line:90%
to the surface.

00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.650 align:middle line:90%
They are becoming more visible.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:32.200 align:middle line:90%
So things need to change.

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And change can be uncomfortable.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But it is, by raising the
vibration of humanity,

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to see the change.

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to
enable us to raise

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:46.600 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of humanity?

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all of this stuff.

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all of the sound.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's reconnecting with who we
really are, with the divine,

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:59.330 align:middle line:84%
with the intelligent
force which is out there.

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is all part of
a beautiful process.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It is actually a beautiful
time to be alive.

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an exciting time to be
on planet Earth right now.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do
is master our energy,

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.360 align:middle line:84%
master our vibration, and
start manifesting this world

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
that we want to live in.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:28.000 align:middle line:84%
That is going to vibrate out
and impact everybody else

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
because we're back to the
all is one, the one is all.

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The light you
are seeking is you.

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And the light that we
all come in with that you

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
see in baby's eyes and
small children when

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
they're delighted and
feeling free is very bright.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to us as we
go through life is we take hits

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and we form limiting beliefs.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.050 align:middle line:90%
We lose that light.

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:54.820 align:middle line:90%
It goes dim on us.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.560 align:middle line:90%
We lose ourselves.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
All of the things that
you think you want

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.280 align:middle line:90%
are already inside of you.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just tension, and stories,
and trauma that's in the way.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.930 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so as we shed this
emotional baggage,

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
as we alchemize this heavy
lead that's in our signals

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
back into the gold
that we are, then we

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:22.490 align:middle line:84%
experience actual
inner illumination.

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Healing is not simply
getting rid of a disease.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Healing is ultimately about
reconnecting with the life

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
force of who we are
and fostering harmony

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in mind, body,
spirit so that we can

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
meet any challenge of the
day and do so with more joy,

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
grace, and ease.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Healing is coming into harmony--

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%
mind, body, and spirit.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.780 align:middle line:10%
And part of that is accepting
the reality of things

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.720 align:middle line:10%
as they are and
then surrendering

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.090 align:middle line:10%
to a higher power and
process that guides

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:59.860 align:middle line:10%
our life and our healing.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
We can sit in the
not knowing and see

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
if we can find even a tiny bit
of comfort in the not knowing

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and allow ourselves to
trust in the process of how

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:17.150 align:middle line:90%
the divine is guiding our life.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So the path of healing and the
path of spiritual liberation

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.420 align:middle line:90%
are truly one and the same.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We are life discovering
exploring, playing with itself,

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.200 align:middle line:90%
occupying itself with stories.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it all
comes from the one.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.300 align:middle line:90%
The one divides into the many.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.630 align:middle line:90%
The many return back to the one.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If the entire world
that we're experiencing is

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
vibratory, when energy is
vibrating, we have life,

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
we have what in the Indian
tradition or in the Vedic

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
tradition is called
Maya, the illusion.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Then sometimes the
question naturally

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
arises, like, well,
what's the point?

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
If all of this is
kind of not real,

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and our real self is sitting
there quietly in the middle,

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
what's the point?

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And the point is for the purpose
of creation, for the expansion.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We are spiritual
interconnected beings having

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:24.080 align:middle line:90%
an earthly experience.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And the research
actually supports

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
what is true about human
nature, that we are all

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
deeply connected, that we are
part of the fabric of reality,

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that even the
so-called differences

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that we see based
on our culture,

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
our upbringing, the color of
our skin, our preferences,

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
are all simply part of
this beautiful tapestry

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of diversity, of oneness
that weaves us together.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is the task at hand
for humanity at this point--

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
to truly recognize
the interconnectedness

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:58.190 align:middle line:90%
and the oneness of what we are.

01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Each one of us is an artist.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Our life is our masterpiece.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
We forget that we
came here to create.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we sit in that
silence and at the same time

01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
also embody that life when
it's vibrating and expanding,

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.790 align:middle line:90%
that's pure magic.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
That was magical
enough for us to say,

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to go out and play and
I want to be a part of this.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And we've forgotten
that because we

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.800 align:middle line:90%
forgot our nature of silence.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.850 align:middle line:90%
