00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:06.519
(gentle music)

2
00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:32.710
(slow music)

3
00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:08.433
(door closes)

4
00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:25.898
(clock ticking)

5
00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.533
<v ->Imagine the universe as an endless pool</v>

6
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.120
in which we are submerged.

7
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.720
The resistance we feel as we move in the water

8
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.905
is what would give us mass.

9
00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:38.397
And every single drop could be a Higgs boson,

10
00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:40.900
the elementary particle.

11
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.106
If we found it, we would be able to formulate

12
00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:48.388
the universe in a single equation.

13
00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:51.909
(speaking foreign language)

14
00:01:57.336 --> 00:02:01.487
<v ->Your choice, Einstein or Schrodinger?</v>

15
00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.029
The kitten is twice as sweet.

16
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:04.584
<v Voiceover>Collision in 30 seconds.</v>

17
00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:13.117
<v ->Have you heard from her?</v>

18
00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.155
hey, don't worry man.

19
00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.512
<v Voiceover>Collision in five, four--</v>

20
00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:21.541
<v ->She probably needs some time.</v>

21
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.403
<v Voiceover>Two, one.</v>

22
00:02:23.403 --> 00:02:24.403
(rushing)

23
00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:26.502
<v ->Einstein or Schrodinger?</v>

24
00:02:26.502 --> 00:02:28.695
The kitten is twice as sweet.

25
00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:36.346
Carlos, are you okay?

26
00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.368
<v Voiceover>Collision has been successful.</v>

27
00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:40.011
Please, check the results.

28
00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:45.981 line:15% 
(clock ticking)

29
00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.681
<v ->Are you kidding?</v>

30
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:58.972
Do you want to play Back to the Future?

31
00:02:58.972 --> 00:03:00.178
<v ->Shh!</v>

32
00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:01.940
Not exactly.

33
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.679
We only need to modify the dimensional instructor

34
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:06.061
of the brains

35
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.288
in order to allow my pressing conscience.

36
00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.596
You know the Carlos from the past.

37
00:03:10.596 --> 00:03:12.094
<v ->Sure, Carlos, sure.</v>

38
00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:14.335
It's so logical to break the space-time continuum.

39
00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:15.287
You're insane, man.

40
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.788
<v ->If I'm right, we could win a Nobel Prize.</v>

41
00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:26.381
The both of us.

42
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.992
Switch it on.

43
00:03:32.054 --> 00:03:35.063
<v ->If we fuck up the universe, I'm going to say it was you.</v>

44
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.607
Just you.

45
00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:44.414
(rushing)

46
00:03:56.628 --> 00:04:00.879
(clock ticking)

47
00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.064
<v ->Have you just said you love me?</v>

48
00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:32.462
I am still single, right?

49
00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:36.834
<v ->Let's see, five years in the MIT,</v>

50
00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:39.603
two years studying a postdoc in Bonn,

51
00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:41.151
another one in Switzerland.

52
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:43.116
<v ->Have you checked the inflection magnets?</v>

53
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.572
<v ->Do you know how much I owe on my student loan?</v>

54
00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:51.533
130,540 dollars, and 56 cents,

55
00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:52.639
do you have any change?

56
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.151
<v ->Man, we need to hurry.</v>

57
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:55.796
<v ->Are you listening to me?</v>

58
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.574
They are going to kick our arses

59
00:04:57.574 --> 00:04:59.285
and then they're going to fire us.

60
00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:00.447
And you know what?

61
00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:02.959
Right then, they're going to hire us again,

62
00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.498
so that they can kick us once more.

63
00:05:05.498 --> 00:05:07.978
And all because of some girl.

64
00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:09.637
<v ->She's got a friend.</v>

65
00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:13.133
<v ->What?</v>

66
00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:14.369
<v ->She said you were cute.</v>

67
00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:19.251
And by the way, she is not some girl.

68
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.041
She's Laura.

69
00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:37.605
(door closes)

70
00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:07.846
(beeping)

71
00:06:07.846 --> 00:06:08.889
<v ->Oh fuck.</v>

72
00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.302
Temperature's unstable.

73
00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:13.757
Carlos, the inflection magnets might fail any second.

74
00:06:13.757 --> 00:06:15.242
<v ->I am so close.</v>

75
00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:16.953
It has to be one of these variables,

76
00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:18.793
I just need to find how.

77
00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:23.710
<v ->We can't risk it any more.</v>

78
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.603
We only have one trip left.

79
00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:27.958
The last one.

80
00:06:34.642 --> 00:06:39.150
(slow music)

81
00:06:55.624 --> 00:07:00.119
(clock ticking)

82
00:07:26.616 --> 00:07:31.452
(slow music)

83
00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:23.725
(rock music)
