"Living On Light."

It seem perfectly logical to
me, because we are light beings.

you stand in the sun,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:10%
or what do you do?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I say, no, no, it's got
nothing to do with that light.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Light is considered to be one
of the highest frequencies.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
In August of 1998, I went
through that 21-day breatharian

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The first seven
days, they're hard.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
You aren't allowed
to eat or drink,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
not a single drop of
water can pass your lips.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
After the first week, though,
you start drinking again,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:90%
clear water.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
that 21-day process,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I really no longer
felt the need for food.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:90%
But I followed that path.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.301 align:middle line:84%
On the 50th day, I
thought to myself,

00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody who
has fasted for 50 days.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And I really don't.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:90%
That's when I knew it worked.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Gradually, your confidence
and faith increase.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Until today, I feel
secure in my practice.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I
lose everything--

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:90%
absolutely everything--

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.276 align:middle line:90%
I still won't need to eat.

00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And if at some point, I
decide it's time to change,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
well, I'll change.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I can stop anytime.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Hell, I don't need
to prove a thing.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never volunteer
for medical testing.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.565 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%

slightly modify the process.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And that means I'm going
to go ahead and start

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:90%

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:90%
I think it makes sense.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Because first, this
isn't fun anymore.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to get tedious and
difficult. It's OK for a while,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:90%

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%

too, because I

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:90%

A lot of people could
benefit from discovering

what fasting can do
for them, but you need

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:10%
to drink plenty of liquids.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
This will flush the kidneys and
generally prevent health risks.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:10%
For spiritual or
religious reasons,

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:10%
one might fast for long periods.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, after
three or four weeks,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
one will indeed
stop losing weight.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Life feels good.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%

relate better to nature

That's the natural
course of things.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%

cutting out food altogether

days without fluids.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
If someone has an extremely
bad diet, is full of toxins,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and has various illnesses,
fasting alone can be difficult.

is necessary.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%

can be very dangerous.

So the reality of this
is planted in the field.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.545 align:middle line:10%
I agree, most people I've spoken
to about this through the media

00:15:01.545 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:10%
have said, crazy
woman, not possible.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:10%
But at least I've
talked about it,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:10%
at least it's put the
idea that maybe it's

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:10%
possible in the field.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:10%
So as we accept something
as being possible,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:10%
the doors to this
open more and more.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, when I went
through this initiation in '93,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I was able, as a consequence, to
attract enough cosmic particles

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to really be able to nourish
my body in a completely

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
different way.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, after
learning to live on light,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I started to learn that if
I wanted to satisfy flavor

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and the odd feeling I wanted for
flavor and taste, which I still

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
wanted, and I took a piece
of chocolate, which I liked,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
but people would go,
oh, how could you do

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%

can nourish you, give you

all your vitamins, minerals,
everything you need,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:10%
once you've given yourself
that freedom by living it,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing else to
prove to anyone else.

mistake early on--

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:10%
I guess, you could say, if
these are seen as mistakes--

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:10%
I just assumed that if I
could do the 21-day process,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:10%
and it gave me this
gift of living on prana,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:10%
that would help everybody.

all of them had eaten.

I didn't even wait
for Sunday to end,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Sunday evening, I sat
down and had a thought,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:90%
have a piece of toast.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:90%
So I ate it.

Then I thought, OK, now,
eat a toast with cheese.

And then I said, now, go on,
eat a toast with cheese and ham.

have simply converted

It stirred me up
emotionally, got me thinking.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And then she told me
about a book by Jasmuheen.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:90%
He does everything except eat.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And what kind of an
eater was he before?

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>> A big eater.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:90%
He totally enjoyed eating.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I simply feel good
living without food.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It does me good.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's what I experience.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And not eating is
simply the price

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.440 align:middle line:90%
I must pay to attain this state.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:90%
I feel healthy.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.159 align:middle line:90%
I'm in good shape.

00:28:55.159 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think I can do more
than I used to in terms

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:90%
of strength and endurance.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I experienced that the
more I push my body,

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:90%
the stronger I get.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:90%
My hair's growing.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
My beard is growing,
my fingernails too.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:10%
Normally, you think,
well, when I eat food,

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:10%
I take in substances and I
digest them, breaking them

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:10%
down a little Lego blocks,
which I reassemble,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:10%
and then my body is
happy and content.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, there is
some truth to that.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:10%
The question, though, is, are
there other ways of doing this?

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Thomas Stockli.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:10%
And I would say I'm
one of Michael Werner's

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:10%
critical friends I follow
his strange way of life,

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:10%
as I refer to it,
with skepticism,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:10%
but great interest as well.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.032 align:middle line:10%
I find it extremely fascinating.

00:29:50.032 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:10%
>> When a scientist hears about
something like breatharian,

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:10%
he should be eager to study
it and ask, what's going on?

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:10%
>> That's why I wanted to work
with Michael Werner to come up

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:10%
with sound, scientific proof.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:10%
>> We both knew that if
we spoke of pranic feeding

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.670 align:middle line:10%
or breatharianism, it would
make things very hard to receive

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:10%
approval.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:10%
>> But I was surprised at
how powerful their opposition

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:10%
and defensiveness to these
new ideas turned out to be.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:10%
>> We submitted our study
to the ethics committee,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:10%
and it took two
years to be approved.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:45.722 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.722 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The experiment took place
a year and a half ago.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
10 days under rigorously
monitored conditions.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.390 align:middle line:84%
They made absolutely
sure I wouldn't

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:90%
be able to eat or leave.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
My room was in an
intensive care unit,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:90%
with the window nailed shut.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:84%
They had the variables
completely under control

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and had established a rigorous,
solid experimental design.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
evaluating the data

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.134 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really all
that complicated.

00:31:13.134 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
One of my requirements
was that they published

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:90%
the findings no matter what.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, today, 1.5
years later, the results

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:90%
still haven't been published.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I found the results
myself rather surprising,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:90%
rather disappointing.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I had lost some weight
during the 10 days.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.667 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.667 --> 00:31:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> He lost a little
weight during that time,

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:84%
but it was still an
incredible accomplishment.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the weight
he lost was minimal.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They did, however, register
an increase in ketone bodies.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.922 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
indication of fasting.

00:31:49.922 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I could only surmise why
this might have occurred,

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and closed conditions that were
indeed difficult and clearly

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:90%
unnatural.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:10%
Because for 10 days, I
was breathing only air

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:10%
from the air conditioner, and
that really felt all wrong.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:84%
We're planning a
second experiment,

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:90%
and I hope we can avoid that.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:29.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Two years after our
first encounter, I visit Dr.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Werner at the Lake Neuchatel,
where he's on vacation.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Not much has changed.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:90%
He still isn't eating.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The Bern study still
hasn't been published.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.960 align:middle line:10%
But at the University
of Prague, he

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:10%
has undergone
another experiment.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.815 align:middle line:10%


00:32:51.815 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The study in Prague came
about because the Bern study

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:10%
still had not been published.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.196 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let's move
on, start over again.

00:33:01.196 --> 00:33:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And we all agreed
from the outset

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
once again that
anything we documented

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:84%
would indeed be published,
no matter the results.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the experiment,

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
when all the results were in,
the man in charge of the study

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
once again said, we're
not publishing it.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.840 align:middle line:90%
He gave no explanation.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
That's how the world
of science reacts.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
It says, either he's a
lunatic, and we have a problem.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Or he's right, and then
we also have a problem.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:90%
So let's just drop it.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The man in charge of the
study in Prague turned me down

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly, refusing
to comment on camera.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Same with the head
physician in Bern.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Ultimately, they also see it
as a threat to the world view

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:10%
of allopathic medicine.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.770 align:middle line:10%
The representatives
of allopathic medicine

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:10%
are not reacting with
appropriate scientific

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:10%
curiosity as one might expect
from a physicist or a chemist.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.440 align:middle line:84%
If a physicist says,
swans are white.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a hypothesis.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:84%
If they find 100,000 white
swans, it's still a hypothesis.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
When they find the
first black swan,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:84%
they test it to
see if it's dyed.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And if it's real,
end of hypothesis,

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.620 align:middle line:84%
disproven with a
single black Swan.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You're right, if this
were, in principle, possible,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
whether just one man
could do it or 100,000.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:10%
It would turn things
on their head.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:10%
Scientific rigor would
indeed require that we

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:10%
re-examine the way we think.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:47.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Aside from the controversies
in the Werner case,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.675 align:middle line:10%
there was another study
conducted in India in 2003 that

00:34:54.675 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:10%
definitely seems to confirm the
phenomenon of pranic feeding.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It was conducted on a yogi
who claims he has neither

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.490 align:middle line:90%
eaten or drank for decades.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.005 align:middle line:10%

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm eager to
meet this mysterious yogi.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And I get the rare
opportunity to film him

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:90%

Prahlad Jani normally lives
in a cave in the mountains.

to celebrate the holy
Navaratri festival.

as a holy man, who

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:84%
had a vision at the age
of seven and, allegedly,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:84%
hasn't had a bite of food
or drop of water since.

Maha Kali, Maha Lakshmi,
and Maha Saraswati.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I consented, prepared myself,
and asked, what about my food?

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
They each placed a finger
on my lips and said,

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:84%
you need not be concerned
about food ever again.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.120 align:middle line:90%
I was seven.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%

stopped eating and drinking.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:42.620 align:middle line:84%
yogini to divest in readers,
who, at the age of 12,

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:46.250 align:middle line:84%
had already learned the
technique of living entirely

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:48.640 align:middle line:90%
without food and drink--

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Giri Bala.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.880 align:middle line:10%
Yogananda also makes
reference to the Yoga Sutras

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:10%
of Patanjali, the
Bible of the yogi.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.000 align:middle line:10%
Written thousands
of years ago, it

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.790 align:middle line:10%
describes a technique
that allows a person

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.690 align:middle line:10%
to live on only
air and sunlight.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The light from the sun enters
the brain, charges the brain.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And through it, the
whole body is charged.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.420 align:middle line:90%
There is no hunger.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:90%
There is no desire for food.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
with the power of the sun.

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a very easy practice.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Sun is the original source
of energy, what we eat.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:10%
The body is a mechanism
to receive sun energy,

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.340 align:middle line:10%
convert it into any other
form of energy required.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens
when you look at the sun

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.640 align:middle line:90%
during safe hours.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:10.710 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:16.050 align:middle line:84%
From 1962, I was reading on
the benefits of sun-gazing

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.260 align:middle line:84%
from the mother of
Ashram And in 1992, I

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:24.430 align:middle line:84%
decided to apply
this in my life.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I retired from
the business in 1992.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And now, my sole mission
is spreading this message.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I invite Mr.
Manick to Vienna.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.100 align:middle line:90%
He rarely eats.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But more interestingly, he
completed a 410-day water fast

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:90%
under medical observation.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want him to meet
Professor Luger from the Vienna

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.440 align:middle line:10%
University Clinic.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.284 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.284 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Beliefs don't change.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.920 align:middle line:84%
This practice
should be encouraged

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.890 align:middle line:90%
by all open-minded people.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is so hard for me
is to understand, every day,

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:10.370 align:middle line:84%
100,000 people die because they
do not receive enough food.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:12.600 align:middle line:90%
This is my question to you.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.140 align:middle line:84%
What would be your
explanation that such

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:84%
a simple and ubiquitous
available thing is not

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.490 align:middle line:90%
used more by the human being?

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Sun-gazing is not a process
to make you less eating or non

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.980 align:middle line:90%
eating at all.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a process by which
you get mental health.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.919 align:middle line:90%
You get physical health.

00:50:35.919 --> 00:50:36.960 align:middle line:90%
You get spiritual health.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you so desire
as your byproduct,

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
you can eat less or
even remain without food

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.553 align:middle line:84%
for many, many months
and years even.

00:50:45.553 --> 00:50:49.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.840 align:middle line:90%
This is what I wanted to say.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Merely saying that
sunlight is falling,

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and you get energy, no,
that is not correct.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It has to be taken
inside your body

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:90%
in a systematic, scientific way.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.890 align:middle line:90%
There are protocols.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.439 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow
that, then you'll

00:51:05.439 --> 00:51:06.605 align:middle line:90%
definitely get the benefits.

00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I belong to a religion
called Jain religion, where

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.450 align:middle line:84%
this fasting is one
of the traditions.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And Jainism always advocates
that one should try

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.720 align:middle line:90%
to eat less and less and less.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:28.482 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.482 --> 00:51:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Ahmedabad in northwest India
is the city with the highest

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.090 align:middle line:90%
density of trains in the world.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn more
about this religion

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that seeks to reduce
food intake to a minimum

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and whose principle
of asceticism

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
is so extreme that the
trained monks, the sadhus,

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:48.290 align:middle line:90%
even renounce.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:55.209 align:middle line:90%


00:51:55.209 --> 00:51:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The number of
sadhus are very few,

00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and they are all most residing
in jungles, not in the city.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.590 align:middle line:84%
You can found that hardly
in cities, very hardly.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.825 align:middle line:84%
Jain sadhus are not
using any vehicles.

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:90%
They are going always by foot.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.780 align:middle line:90%
They have no house.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.430 align:middle line:90%
They have no help.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.770 align:middle line:84%
They not keep a single
money with a single rupee,

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.282 align:middle line:90%
because of happiness.

00:52:22.282 --> 00:52:28.490 align:middle line:10%
In Jain, they say try not to
go for any violence first.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:90%


00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So in fasting also, the main
purposes is for violence.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.930 align:middle line:84%
If you're not taking any food,
then the violence principle

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:50.720 align:middle line:90%
will keep alive.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Normally, with [INAUDIBLE],,
we can say that is up to one

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:90%
month, is a very easy fasting.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can fast.

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Even a small boy of four
years, three years, two years,

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.740 align:middle line:90%
they are fasting.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We are in a strict manner,
a jain religion manner,

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:90%
not taking any food.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So many person are
not taking even water.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.884 align:middle line:84%
Without water, they can
resist to six months.

00:53:18.884 --> 00:53:22.490 align:middle line:84%
If your will-power is strong,
not necessary pour any energy.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> These are ancient traditions
with positive experiences.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:10%
It's a common
thing in religions.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:10%
Mohammed once said, prayer
gets us halfway to heaven.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:10%
Fasting gets us to the
very door of heaven.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And this form of living
without physical nourishment

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.350 align:middle line:10%
has a long tradition.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:84%
There are such accounts
in our own tradition too.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:52.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, Theres Neumann of
Konnersreuth, during Nazi rule,

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.040 align:middle line:84%
her only food was apparently
the daily Eucharist.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.400 align:middle line:84%
The last thing the Nazis wanted
was another Catholic Saint,

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.020 align:middle line:90%
so they monitored her.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.659 align:middle line:84%
And her case is fairly
well-documented.

00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:07.412 align:middle line:90%


00:54:07.412 --> 00:54:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:15.860 align:middle line:10%
>> She lived without food from
1926 till her death in 1962.

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.670 align:middle line:10%
Scientists studied this
phenomenon as best they could.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It started with her medical
examination and monitoring

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.060 align:middle line:90%
in July of 1927.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.700 align:middle line:84%
After two weeks,
this was aborted.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the doctors pronounced
that she should already

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:33.635 align:middle line:90%
have been dead for days.

00:54:33.635 --> 00:54:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> She wasn't hungry.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:42.080 align:middle line:10%
She couldn't have
eaten anything either.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.120 align:middle line:10%
Even if she had wanted
to, she quite simply

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.910 align:middle line:10%
could not physically eat.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:50.955 align:middle line:84%
To me, it was a
miracle, is a miracle.

00:54:50.955 --> 00:54:53.000 align:middle line:84%
To a non-believer,
Neumann will always

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.880 align:middle line:90%
remain an unresolved issue.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.440 align:middle line:84%
All he can say is that
there is no explanation.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.800 align:middle line:84%
No natural law
exists to explain it.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And so for them,
it must be a hoax.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We can find many baffling
instances of fasting throughout

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Western history if
we look closely.

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.180 align:middle line:10%
In addition to Saint
Nicholas of Flüe,

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.270 align:middle line:10%
Christian medieval
mysticism, in particular,

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:25.000 align:middle line:10%
boasts quite a few
forgotten cases.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:10%
For example, [INAUDIBLE]
of who fell seriously ill

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.780 align:middle line:90%
and was healed by visions.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.670 align:middle line:84%
According to the
annals, she didn't

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.990 align:middle line:84%
eat for the rest of her life as
many Christian saints have also

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:39.440 align:middle line:90%
been described as doing.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:47.690 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:51.360 align:middle line:10%
But the most frequent
and oldest documentation

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.550 align:middle line:10%
on the art of
living without food

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:57.391 align:middle line:10%
is found in the Chinese
Taoist tradition.

00:55:57.391 --> 00:56:06.046 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The first documented cases
are from the Warring States

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:84%
period, more than
2000 years ago.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.220 align:middle line:84%
At the time, some
people had already

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:23.060 align:middle line:90%
achieved the state of bigu.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.616 align:middle line:90%
What does bigu mean?

00:56:25.616 --> 00:56:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Gu literally means springs,
but symbolically, it

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:90%
extends for all food.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Bi means to avoid.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.680 align:middle line:84%
One avoids food
and, by doing so,

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:42.380 align:middle line:90%
achieves health and vitality.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.750 align:middle line:90%
That is the meaning of bigu.

00:56:44.750 --> 00:57:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:08.300 align:middle line:84%
For ages, there have been
people in the Wudang mountains

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:13.780 align:middle line:84%
who have achieved the bigu
state through training.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:19.350 align:middle line:84%
They reach this state by
replenishing chi, or life

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:22.230 align:middle line:90%
force, through exercises.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:24.235 align:middle line:84%
These people can go
without food for years.

00:57:24.235 --> 00:57:27.040 align:middle line:90%


00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.420 align:middle line:84%
In order to experience bigu, one
has to reach a certain level.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.480 align:middle line:84%
One must train
regularly and be fit.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.250 align:middle line:84%

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.646 align:middle line:90%
Rosinov.

01:08:27.646 --> 01:08:32.576 align:middle line:90%


01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:38.403 align:middle line:90%
>> This looks terrific.

01:08:38.403 --> 01:08:39.569 align:middle line:90%
It's just what you hope for.

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:41.520 align:middle line:10%
As far as I can
tell, this appears

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.770 align:middle line:10%
to reflect a perfect
energy state.

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:48.240 align:middle line:90%


01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.279 align:middle line:10%
The basis of this gas
discharge visualization

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.240 align:middle line:10%
is kirlian effect,
which may elicit

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.149 align:middle line:10%
howls of protest because
of its past connections

01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.310 align:middle line:10%
with dubious applications.

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But we've made progress
since those days

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and are now able to
exploit the kirlian effect

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%
for real scientific benefits.

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:10.319 align:middle line:84%
It's a legitimate way to
create a visual record

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:13.350 align:middle line:90%
of the human energy field.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I think this
particular human energy

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
field is comparable to
what Chinese medicine calls

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.470 align:middle line:90%
chi, or life force.

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And we are beginning to realize
that the size of this field

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.189 align:middle line:84%
is a parameter for a
person's energy state.

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:34.204 align:middle line:90%


01:09:34.204 --> 01:09:37.729 align:middle line:84%
An energetically-beautiful,
well-rounded, balanced diagram

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:40.580 align:middle line:90%
like this is quite rare.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.359 align:middle line:84%
If this woman doesn't really eat
food, if that's actually true--

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>> She also doesn't drink.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> She doesn't drink anything?

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> She says she stopped
drinking in the year 2000.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't believe that.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I prove
it to the doctors?

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
It is a fact.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.830 align:middle line:90%
How can I prove it is possible?

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:00.630 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.244 align:middle line:84%
The proof is sitting
in front of you.

01:10:03.244 --> 01:10:12.700 align:middle line:90%


01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything a doctor or a
scientist says about a human

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
system regarding nutrition is
absolutely true when the brain

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
wave patterns are anchored in
what I call the beta frequency.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
start to engage

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual
lifestyle, of meditation,

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of prayer, of service, of
being in the company of truth

01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
of silence, of nature, of
listening to devotional music,

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
these sorts of
things change the way

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the brain operates, changes the
brainwave patterns from alpha

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:48.320 align:middle line:84%
to theta and start to reveal
amazing hidden capabilities

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.555 align:middle line:90%
within the human system.

01:10:49.555 --> 01:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%


01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think any allopathic doctor
would have to be skeptical.

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:05.990 align:middle line:10%
It contradicts everything
we've been taught.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.900 align:middle line:10%
And thus, all we
can say is there are

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.030 align:middle line:10%
many things I don't understand.

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:14.480 align:middle line:90%
This is one such instance.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm afraid that actual
understanding of the mechanism

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:20.120 align:middle line:10%
of this phenomenon is not
really enhanced by the data

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.940 align:middle line:10%
we collected from
Hira Ratan Manek.

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:27.840 align:middle line:90%


01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.450 align:middle line:10%
>> For example, his weight
isn't low or even normal.

01:11:31.450 --> 01:11:33.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he's
overweight for his size.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
He's 5 foot 9 and
weighs 185 pounds.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible
that his system can

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
stabilize like this
without him losing

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.390 align:middle line:90%
enormous amounts of weight.

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:47.280 align:middle line:90%
How can it be?

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are
other phenomena at play

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.765 align:middle line:84%
here, which we have
no way of testing.

01:11:51.765 --> 01:11:54.630 align:middle line:90%


01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The experts who would
definitely have more to say

01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:58.890 align:middle line:84%
in this matter would
be the physicists.

01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:15.310 align:middle line:90%


01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:18.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Nowhere but in physics do
I know of any laws that could

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:22.460 align:middle line:10%
answer questions like, how
do cells carry out thousands

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:28.800 align:middle line:10%
of chemical reactions at the
right time, at the right place,

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.810 align:middle line:10%
and in the right way?

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:34.550 align:middle line:90%


01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:40.130 align:middle line:10%
Today, we know that
biophotons are responsible.

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
These biophotons are
an emission of light.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
They might, for example,
be radiated by the sun.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
A chemical reaction only
occurs if it is previously

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.990 align:middle line:90%
activated by light.

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
These weak rays
in the cell assume

01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:00.330 align:middle line:90%
this regulating capability.

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
They are responsible for keeping
everything running smoothly.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:11.760 align:middle line:90%


01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Even if we eat food,
this nourishment

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
has the task of transferring
the sunlight stored there

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
within its chemical bonds to
the consumer in such a way

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that it can be
optimally reorganized.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
This organizing
capacity of the consumer

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
by which he gets used
from eating of food

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:35.010 align:middle line:84%
does not come from the molecules
consumed, but from the light

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that he or she literally
sucks out of the food.

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:41.180 align:middle line:90%


01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Take sugar, for example.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.200 align:middle line:10%
Sugar consists of carbon
dioxide and water.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide is
expelled by the lungs.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Water is excreted by the organs.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:54.440 align:middle line:90%
What remains is light.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.490 align:middle line:90%


01:13:58.490 --> 01:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, it is
not matter, substances,

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
or molecules that we
live on but information.

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Burning fuel is a pure energy
process that is tied into this,

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.400 align:middle line:90%
but doesn't play a major role.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
What is essential is
the storage of light

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and the supply of
light to the organism,

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
because the organism
is a light being.

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%


01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That is why it is
asserted, and it

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
is theoretically
possible for an organism

01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to give up physical food
and live on light alone.

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
This is indeed
theoretically possible.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%


01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, it's very easy
for people to dismiss the idea.

01:14:49.837 --> 01:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Because to say, well,
there are an awful lot

01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
of people out there who
are starving to death.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, if they could
eat light, they would do it.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.200 align:middle line:10%
So there is something which
is not an obvious effect.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.280 align:middle line:10%
You may require 40 years
of meditation experience

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.530 align:middle line:10%
before you can get to the
point where you can do this.

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:08.946 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
starving to death,

01:15:08.946 --> 01:15:11.250 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a chance to
spend 40 years meditating.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:12.238 align:middle line:90%
It's too late.

01:15:12.238 --> 01:15:25.600 align:middle line:90%


01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I still don't understand
why some people apparently live

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
without food while
others starve.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
This question leads
me to California

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to the Institute
of Noetic Sciences

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the consciousness
researcher, Dean Radin who

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
offers me insight into the
world of human consciousness.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness seems to
be an organizing principle,

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.442 align:middle line:90%
something that creates order.

01:15:49.442 --> 01:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, you
get to say, well,

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.524 align:middle line:84%
what is the difference
between a living

01:15:52.524 --> 01:15:56.560 align:middle line:90%
person and a non-living person?

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes before they're dead.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.394 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is in one case,

01:16:00.394 --> 01:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be a
conscious awareness.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they're dead, there's
no conscious awareness anymore.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, maybe
conscious awareness

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is something like an
organizing principle.

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
organizes energy.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you extract that
organizing principle

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:16.028 align:middle line:84%
from the body, the body
very quickly falls apart.

01:16:16.028 --> 01:16:20.920 align:middle line:90%


01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Dean Radin has
been doing research

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
for more than 25 years
for the US government

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and various research institutes
on phenomena and possibilities

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.080 align:middle line:10%
He is the man to
ask, to what extent

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.750 align:middle line:10%
it is possible for the
body to be nourished

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:40.240 align:middle line:10%
by the power of mind alone?

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> The tradition is worldwide.

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.250 align:middle line:90%
There are breatharians.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
There are people doing
the practice of bigu.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And these traditions,
I think, are

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
taking advantage of the fact
that what we really need

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.290 align:middle line:90%
to survive is ordered energy.

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:57.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what we actually consume.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason why plants and,
indirectly, animals are useful

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
is because they
are a way of taking

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the coherent energy of the
sun and storing it and making

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.550 align:middle line:90%
it even more coherent.

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And then we eat that.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're eating is not
so much the physical nutrients

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.870 align:middle line:90%
as the energetic.

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And this fits in, then,
with this experiment

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%
that we did using chocolate.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
What we did was
one group would get

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
the commercial

of us to a very tiny degree,

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.130 align:middle line:84%
but collectively, to
a significant extent.

01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:44.862 align:middle line:84%
The world is a construction
of human consciousness.

01:27:44.862 --> 01:27:52.950 align:middle line:90%


01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:55.440 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not saying stop
eating and drinking.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.340 align:middle line:10%
That's not the point.

01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:59.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm just saying that through
the phenomenon breatharianis,

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:02.700 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people are coming
to a critical reevaluation

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.220 align:middle line:10%
of their relationship
to matter in general.

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
eating and drinking.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to hypothesize
alternative forms

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.550 align:middle line:90%
of alternative source of energy.

01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is the real thing
which I'm looking at.

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking
at this one case.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking the
force behind that.

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is really going to
change the future of mankind.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'm pretty sure.

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Take it from me.
