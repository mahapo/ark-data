So it's real important
to take everything out.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Trash, everything
that we bring in.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:47.783 align:middle line:84%
We're already affecting the
land by trampling on it.

00:48:47.783 --> 00:48:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We might as well make sure we
take everything out with us.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Leave it how you found it.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:53.127 align:middle line:84%
Leave it better
than you found it.

00:48:53.127 --> 00:48:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Leave it better
than you found it.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Leave yourself better than
you found yourself too.
