00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
In 1968, Apollo 8 
went to the moon.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:47.005 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They didn't land, but they 
did circle the moon.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I was watching it on television,

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.012 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and at a certain point one of
the astronauts casually said,

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:58.016 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
"We're going to turn the camera
around and show you the Earth."

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And he did, and that was the
first time I had ever seen

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.986 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the planet hanging in space
like that, and it was profound.

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:74% position:36% size:73%
I think that for me, like
for many other people, it was

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
quite a shock. I don't think any
of us had any expectations

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:20.998 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
about how it would give us 
such a different perspective.

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:25.002 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think the focus had been:
we're going to the stars,

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.086 align:middle line:74% position:48% size:48%
we're going to the 
other planets, and

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.005 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
suddenly we look
back at ourselves

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it seems to imply a new
kind of self-awareness.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:74% position:31% size:68%
One of the astronauts said,
"When we originally went 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.059 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
to the moon, our total focus 
was on the moon,

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we weren't thinking about
looking back at the Earth.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.272 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
But now that we've done it,

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:49.985 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that may well have been the
most important reason we went."

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Oh golly, I remember going
through launch,

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:20.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which is an overwhelming
experience.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:38.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The engines cut off, I felt
myself floating out of the seat,

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.996 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I floated over to the window,
looked out,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we were coming up over the
coast of Africa.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And that's when it hit me,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.005 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
I'm in space.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I just got incredibly
excited because it's something

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I had dreamed about since 
I was six years old.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:05.102 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
I think you start out with this
idea of what it's going to

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:08.063 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
be like. And then when you
do finally look at the Earth

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:11.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for the first time, you're
overwhelmed by how much more

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:14.111 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
beautiful it really is 
when you see it for real.

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:20.617 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
It's just this dynamic, alive
place that you see glowing

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.785 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
all the time.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It was truly incredible 
to be up there,

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
doing what I've always wanted
to do my whole life.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then to glance back at our
planet, and see that view,

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
was just tremendous.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.513 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I can only describe what I've
seen. Looking down at

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:45.016 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:81%
the Earth you see that line that
separates day into night

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.603 align:middle line:79% position:25% size:61%
slowly moving across the
planet. Thunderstorms

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.982 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
on the horizon casting these
long shadows as the sun sets.

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And then watching the 
Earth come alive

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.987 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and you see the lights from the
cities and the towns.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.991 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The events you see from space,
like flying over thunderstorms,

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
looking at them 
from the top,

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
were spectacular, like a
firework show going on

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and you're looking at it 
from the very top.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:14.004 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
Shooting stars going below us,
or dancing curtains of auroras,

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:50%
it's just very hard 
to describe

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.886 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
all the colors, 
the beauty, the motion.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
My job as Lunar Module pilot

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
was to be responsible for the
Lunar Module itself,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.983 align:middle line:79% position:25% size:61%
and responsible for the 
science on the moon.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
So when we started home,

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.322 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
I had a little more time to
look out the window than the

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:44.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
other guys, because most of my
responsibilities were completed.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:50.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We were in a particular mode
called the ‘barbecue mode',

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so we were flying like this,
and rotating like that.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.005 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
What that caused to happen 
was every two minutes

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a picture of the Earth, 
the Moon, the Sun,

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:03.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and a 360 degree panorama 
of the heavens

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
appeared in the 
spacecraft window.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:11.019 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I had studied astronomy, and 
I had studied cosmology,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:16.358 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and fully understood that the
molecules in my body, and

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.986 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
the molecules in my partners'
bodies, and in the spacecraft

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
had been prototyped in some
ancient generation of stars.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.994 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In other words, it was pretty
obvious from those descriptions

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
that we're stardust.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Well that was pretty 
awesome, and powerful.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:38.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Particularly since I had a
little more time at this point

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to be reflective, and 
to think about it.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.348 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
Awe is one of those words I
think you have a better

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
understanding of 
once you see it too.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I felt like using the word
awesome was totally appropriate

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.982 align:middle line:79% position:31% size:68%
when it came to describing 
what the planet looks like.

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
To have that experience of awe
is, at least for the moment,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.535 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:63%
to let go of yourself, to
transcend the sense of

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:13.039 align:middle line:74% position:33% size:70%
separation. So it's not just
that they were experiencing

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.667 align:middle line:79% position:29% size:65%
something other than them,
but that they were

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:19.212 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
at some very deep level
integrating, realizing their

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:23.842 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
interconnectedness with 
that beautiful blue-green ball.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
And this is why the astronauts,
particularly in the

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
International Space Station,
often say that much of their

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.605 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
free time is filled with what
they call ‘Earth gazing'--

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:39.316 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
just staring out at the Earth.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.484 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
They can stare for hours,

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:45.071 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
because the changing scenery,
the interactivity of the

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:49.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
biosphere, all of this, has an
incredible aesthetic impact.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:55.582 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The beauty of seeing Earth as a
planet, as opposed to

00:06:55.582 --> 00:07:01.004 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:65%
being down here among it, 
is a wonderful experience,

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:06.009 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to then start to get into what
we call the Big Picture Effect,

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.012 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
or the Overview Effect.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:14.893 align:middle line:74% position:31% size:68%
I was flying cross-country,
from the East coast to the

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
West coast in the 1970s, and I
was looking out the window.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.778 align:middle line:74% position:33% size:70%
And as I was looking down at
the planet, the thought came

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.822 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:56%
to me: anyone living
in a space settlement,

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
or living on the moon, would
always have an overview.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:35.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They would see things that we
know, but we don't experience,

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:39.459 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:61%
which is that the Earth 
is one system, 

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.503 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and we're all part 
of that system.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:47.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that there is a certain
unity and coherence to it all.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:51.012 align:middle line:79% position:33% size:70%
And I immediately called it 
the "Overview Effect."

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:56.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You do, from that perspective,
see the Earth as a planet.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You see the sun as a star.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.985 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
We see the sun in a blue sky,
but up there you see the sun in

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:11.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a black sky. So you are seeing
it from a cosmic perspective.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We've been evolving from the
beginning of civilization to a

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.001 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
larger and larger perspective 
of life on the Earth.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:26.715 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
But the next natural evolution
is understanding the life in

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.927 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:81%
space. That is the fact that
the Earth, as Buckminster Fuller

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:35.014 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
used to famously say, is
a spaceship: Spaceship Earth.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:40.103 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
We are in space already, it's
just that we haven't brought

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.981 align:middle line:79% position:29% size:65%
that into our perspective 
as we live here on Earth.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:47.944 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
The Overview Effect is simply
the sudden recognition that we

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
live on a planet, and all the
implications that brings

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:58.538 align:middle line:79% position:27% size:63%
to life on Earth. When we
look down at the Earth

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:04.002 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
from space we see this amazing,
indescribably beautiful planet.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.504 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It looks like a living,
breathing organism.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But it also, at the same time,
looks extremely fragile.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.681 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:58%
Because you go outside 
on a clear day, and

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.018 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
it's the 'big blue sky ...it's
like it goes on forever.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:23.813 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
How could we possibly put
enough stuff into it

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to fill it up with things 
that really change it?

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:29.986 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And yet, you see it from space,
and it's this thin line

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:34.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is just barely hugging
the surface of the planet.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Anybody else who's ever gone
into space says the same thing.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.504 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
Because it really is striking,
and it's really sobering to see

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:50.215 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
this paper-thin layer, and 
to realize that that little

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
paper-thin layer is all that
protects every living thing

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:58.014 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on Earth from death, from the
harshness of space.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:04.729 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:81%
There's this very poetic concept
that a lot of people express:

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that there are no 
boundaries from space.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I've heard a lot of my
astronaut colleagues say that.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.988 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Unfortunately, it's not true,
you do see boundaries.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:17.992 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They're mostly the 
result of human impact,

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:22.914 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you can see erosion and
clear-cutting of forests.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:27.001 align:middle line:74% position:27% size:63%
It's a long litany of
environmental impact that

00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.463 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
we've had on our planet. That's
something which, when you

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.716 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:56%
see it from the cosmic
perspective, makes you

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.886 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
really appreciate the 
concept of Spaceship Earth,

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.055 align:middle line:74% position:18% size:45%
and that we're 
all here together.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.438 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
After I came back, and tried 
to understand what this

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:50.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
experience was all about, 
I could find nothing

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:53.653 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the science literature
about it, and nothing in the

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:57.991 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
religious literature that I
looked at. So I turned

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:01.661 align:middle line:74% position:31% size:68%
to the local university and
asked them to help me

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.456 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:56%
with what I saw. When 
they came back to me

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:81%
a few weeks later, they said,
"Well, in the ancient literature

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we found a description called

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:50%
‘savikalpa samadhi'.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That means that you see things
as you see them with your eyes,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.013 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but you experience them
emotionally and viscerally,

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:25.018 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as with ecstasy, and a sense of
total unity and oneness.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I said, well that's exactly
what the experience was.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.817 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
And so it was rather clear to
me, as I studied this,

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:36.029 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:58%
that it wasn't anything
new, but was something

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.908 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:70%
very important to the way we
humans were put together.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:45.079 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:61%
Many of the great wisdom
traditions of the Earth

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:48.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have pointed to what we're
calling the "Overview Effect."

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:54.464 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:61%
That is to say they have
realized this unity,

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
this oneness, of all life on
Earth, and of consciousness

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.178 align:middle line:74% position:15% size:35%
and awareness.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.972 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Within the Western tradition,

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.892 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
I think it's quite new, and
quite shocking

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because there's been much more
of a sense of separation.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:12.649 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:61%
But if you look at other
non-Western cultures,

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.444 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:81%
especially in Asia, the emphasis
on those has always been on

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:20.156 align:middle line:74% position:36% size:73%
realization that the self and
the world are not separate

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.992 align:middle line:74% position:40% size:75%
from each other, that 
they're really interconnected:

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.996 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that the individual self, 
and the species as a whole,

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is a manifestation 
of the larger whole.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:36.005 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
As you go into your mind 
in a contemplative way,

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:42.512 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the sense of the living reality
of the planet becomes obvious.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You become more in tune 
with the natural world.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:48.768 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
This is very akin to the direct
perception that the astronauts

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:52.397 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
have, so it's no wonder that
many people have likened

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.942 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:61%
the Overview Effect to a
spiritual or meditative

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
experience, although 
it's not exactly that.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.739 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
It's a cognitive shift, that
very often can produce

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a kind of meditative experience.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.458 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:63%
I'm sure we all interpret
it somewhat differently.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
I know some of the fellows 
go right to a religious

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:20.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
explanation. I didn't, I went to
more of a science explanation.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:74% position:40% size:75%
I think all that's wonderful--
that's what it takes to

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.222 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:53%
build a civilization.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This view of the Earth from
space-- the whole Earth

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
perspective, I think is
the true symbol of this age.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.989 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I believe what's going to
happen is there's going to be

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:46.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a greater and greater interest
in communicating this idea.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.579 align:middle line:74% position:27% size:63%
Because, after all, it's 
key to our survival--

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:52.999 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
we have to start acting as one
species with one destiny,

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:56.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
we are not going to survive 
if we don't do that.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:02.592 align:middle line:74% position:40% size:75%
We're seeing very clearly that
if the Earth becomes sick,

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.803 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
then we become sick. 
If the Earth dies,

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.389 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
then we're going to die.
People sense that something's

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.892 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
wrong, but they're
still struggling to go back

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.144 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
and find out what the real 
roots of the problem are.

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:16.731 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
And I think what we need to
come to is a realization that

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.609 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
it's not just fixing an
economical or political system,

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:23.404 align:middle line:79% position:33% size:70%
it's a basic worldview,
a basic understanding of who

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.448 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:58%
we are that's at stake.

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.619 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:63%
And a part of that is to 
come up with a new story,

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.789 align:middle line:74% position:27% size:63%
a new picture, a new way 
to approach this,

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.917 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
and to shift our behaviors 
in such a way

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that it leads to a sustainable
approach to our civilization

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.798 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as opposed to a destructive
approach.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:47.386 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
It is a fragile planet, and if
we don't take care of it,

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:50.681 align:middle line:74% position:46% size:68%
and we don't work together,
then we are going to have

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.809 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:58%
bigger issues than we 
have now down the road.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:57.271 align:middle line:74% position:24% size:58%
On a grand scale, we're
basically all living in

00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:63%
this one ecosystem called
Earth. And everything you

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.319 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:53%
do on one side of the
ecosystem affects

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:07.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the other side, and that
is a new way for living

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:53%
for most of humanity.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:65%
We humans are 
responsible for ourselves,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.375 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:75%
and if we are endangering our
future then we've got to learn

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.293 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
how to do it differently,

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:22.713 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:61%
and to go forward into a
sustainable period.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:28.344 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Right now that seems very
difficult-- very difficult to

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.763 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
see how it's going to be,
but we've go to work on it.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.307 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:65%
When I was above the space
station, looking down at

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:37.145 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the space station, looking down
against the Earth, and seeing

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.982 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
this amazing accomplishment, 
I was thinking ‘wow'.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:79% position:31% size:68%
There were fifteen nations 
that worked together

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.361 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to build this amazing orbital
complex in space.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:48.656 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:56%
If we can take 
these fifteen nations,

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.575 align:middle line:79% position:29% size:48%
and do this amazing

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.575 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:38%
accomplishment,

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.994 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
imagine what we can do 
by working together,

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by setting aside our
differences for a common goal,

00:15:55.997 --> 00:16:01.002 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to overcome some of the
challenges facing our planet.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:09.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have this connection to
Earth-- I mean, it's our home.

00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:15.016 align:middle line:74% position:45% size:73%
I don't know how you can come
back and not in some way

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:20.354 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
be changed. It may be subtle,
you see differences in

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.815 align:middle line:79% position:25% size:61%
different people in just
the general response

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.902 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
when they come back from space.
But I think collectively

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:29.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
everybody has that
emblazoned on their memories

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.282 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the way the planet looks.

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.868 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:50%
You know, you can't 
take that lightly.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:38.080 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
You realize you've been blessed
by the opportunity to see that.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.043 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:63%
It really does look like 
this beautiful oasis

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
out in the middle of
nothingness.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.546 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And if you have a chance 
for your eyes to adjust,

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and you can actually see the
stars and the Milky Way,

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:52.094 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it's this oasis against 
the backdrop of infinity,

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:55.014 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:48%
this enormous
universe behind it.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:17:00.019 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
It's really a very moving
experience to be able to see

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.479 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:50%
that with your eyes.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.192 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:50%
You look back at it,

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and it's placed perfectly from
the sun to take care of us,

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:11.614 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and you kind of take that
reverse role on about,

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.158 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:56%
well, we need to be
taking care of it too,

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:17.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
so it can continue to 
do that for us.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:22.667 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I don't know how you can't have
a greater appreciation for it

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
after you see it that way.
