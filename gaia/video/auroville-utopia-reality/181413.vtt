to establish yourself.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And that saddens me
right now, because I

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:16.513 align:middle line:84%
feel the power is
in that generation.

00:47:16.513 --> 00:47:24.090 align:middle line:90%

>> To speak about the future of
Auroville in my understanding,

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:10%
it means putting a certain
concept on the future

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.430 align:middle line:10%
of Auroville.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It means putting your ideas
on the future of Auroville.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is precisely
what we should not do more

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.730 align:middle line:90%
than our founders have done.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think we cannot do anything
better and then follow the flow

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:84%
of development and trying
to be, in our terminology,

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:09.150 align:middle line:84%
as open and receptive for this
vision of Auroville that is

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.140 align:middle line:90%
already there.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:19.210 align:middle line:90%

of culture and race.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It is not easy.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Many can't take it,
despite their goodwill.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.980 align:middle line:10%
They can't handle the heat,
the tensions, or the work

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.560 align:middle line:10%
that one is supposed to do here.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It is a kind of
natural selection.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.310 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, those
who don't manage leave.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.930 align:middle line:90%
But it does not mean anything.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:49.020 align:middle line:84%
There are also other people who
have worked here for many years

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and who take abroad what
they have learned here.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way
things spread contagiously

>> Becoming Aurovillian opened
my eyes to see much more.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.170 align:middle line:10%
And it is grace
that I started deep,

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:33.550 align:middle line:10%
rediscovering my own culture.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I think I should
thank Mother for that.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been many attempts
at creating an ideal city

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.580 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Aurovillians have chosen the
path traced by The Mother

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and Sri Aurobindo, the search
for a new consciousness, which

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:90%
is essential for human unity.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.780 align:middle line:84%
For 30 years, the experiment
in South India resists,

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.690 align:middle line:84%
suffers setbacks,
and advances again,

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:84%
thus giving the impression
that the best craftsmen,

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:05.920 align:middle line:84%
but also the most dangerous
enemy of this ideal, is man.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.140 align:middle line:84%
This confronts us
with a question.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Can man live up to his ideals?

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH].

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.820 align:middle line:10%
>> The simple fact of
confronting humanity with its

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.370 align:middle line:10%
ideals provides the answer.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:22.430 align:middle line:10%
Because these ideals were made
and conceived by human beings.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The simple fact of thinking
that such and such thing

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.260 align:middle line:84%
would be desirable
to describe an ideal,

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.382 align:middle line:84%
this simple fact shows that
one should be able to live it,

00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:32.215 align:middle line:90%
to make it concrete.

00:50:32.215 --> 00:50:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You can go to the Himalayas
and the high mountain,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.700 align:middle line:90%
sit there and meditate.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.030 align:middle line:84%
You can also have
fulfillment or realization,

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.880 align:middle line:84%
as we call them, through
purely meditation and so on.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.020 align:middle line:84%
But Auroville stands for
fulfillment through work.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Work which is
meaningful, work which

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:84%
can regenerate the
environment, which

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.780 align:middle line:84%
can regenerate the
human spirit and create

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:03.080 align:middle line:84%
more level of understanding
and compassion among people.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think its message is very
relevant in today's world,

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.700 align:middle line:84%
as after the
September 11th events,

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.655 align:middle line:90%
this is the message of hope.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.090 align:middle line:84%

think about a better world.

And the admirable.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Marvelous thing is exactly
this capacity of man

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.510 align:middle line:84%
not to be satisfied,
to be unsubmissive

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.110 align:middle line:90%
and to always dream of more.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, maybe one
day, even realizing it.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your question,
is man capable of living up

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:90%
to his ideals?

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:84%
The answer is yes,
by definition.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Mother have said, in spite
of all the effort what human

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:52.120 align:middle line:84%
beings is taken, it is
beyond their capacity.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Auroville will be
built, no matter.
