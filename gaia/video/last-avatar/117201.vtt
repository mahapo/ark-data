00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Then, it's time.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>It is.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:37.774 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.774 --> 00:13:38.274 align:middle line:90%
>>Daybreak.

00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:43.197 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:43.697 align:middle line:90%
Daybreak.

00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Daybreak.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:14:03.261 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.261 --> 00:14:03.844 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello, Jack.

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.226 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
remember me, do you?

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.686 align:middle line:84%
Funny, how your memory leaves
you right after you're born.

00:14:18.686 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It can take decades
sometimes for people

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
to even remember who they
are or why they're here.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.787 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people
never even get that far.

00:14:29.787 --> 00:14:33.522 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.522 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You're more than you
think you are, Jack.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Once you wake up,
you can't come back.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.365 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm not awake?

00:14:51.365 --> 00:14:53.448 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's just say you're
not who you think you are.

00:14:53.448 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.952 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not who you are now.

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It's who you're going to be.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.337 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
be a great leader.

00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Your words, Jack, your words
are going to reveal the truth.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.711 align:middle line:10%
And by your example,
you're going

00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:10%
to create a whole new
world right here on Earth.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.269 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Ridiculous.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.768 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a great leader.

00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:25.065 align:middle line:90%
I don't even wanna be a leader.

00:15:25.065 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I just have to finish
my damn script.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:33.442 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.442 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:10%
How do you now my name?

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>I didn't know
it then, but I was

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
talking to the legendary
Count St. Germain, alchemist,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:90%
nobleman, and alleged immortal.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Hey, everyone,
it's Mary37 again.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Last night, I had this dream
that I would meet Kalki today,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:90%
but someone's trying to stop us.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm posting this in
hopes that he's watching.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
lot of people asking,

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
you know, why do we need Kalki?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So in response, I've posted
a new site with headlines

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.716 align:middle line:10%
Why do we need Kalki?

00:16:34.716 --> 00:16:36.382 align:middle line:10%
Let's start with three
nuclear meltdowns

00:16:36.382 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:10%
happening at once,
thousands of people

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:10%
dying in civil war in Darfur.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:10%
How about this?

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Home foreclosures hit
the highest rates ever.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Where are we supposed to live?

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I could go on and on.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:90%
This is why we need Kalki.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.023 align:middle line:90%
He's our only hope.

00:16:54.023 --> 00:16:59.272 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.272 --> 00:17:00.605 align:middle line:90%
>>Ready to go to the headwaters?

00:17:00.605 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>The first rule of
the hiker's handbook

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:90%
is don't leave the trail.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Starvation, injury,
and death can occur.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:90%
Well, I left the trail.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I saw her,
the mountain they call Shasta.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.863 align:middle line:84%
She was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
say that I was lost,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.152 align:middle line:90%
but really, I had been found.

00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.195 align:middle line:84%
I had found my way to the
little town of Mount Shasta.

00:17:46.195 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know what
was waiting for me here.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:18:05.222 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.222 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if there's,
like, a rock or crystal

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.662 align:middle line:90%
shop around here?

00:18:08.662 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Straight ahead.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%
It's on the left.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Cool.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:12.789 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Interested in
buying a crystal?

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.898 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what you
would give me for this.

00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I found it in the woods.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.121 align:middle line:90%
Do you like it?

00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.592 align:middle line:84%
>>I could-- we could
give you $20 for it.

00:19:14.592 --> 00:19:15.092 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah?

00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>That crystal was
meant for you, Jack.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.955 align:middle line:84%
>>On second thought, I don't--
I don't think I'll sell it.

00:19:26.955 --> 00:19:27.455 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>40.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.336 align:middle line:90%
This is 521.

00:19:42.336 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:90%
The crystal has been found.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.504 align:middle line:84%
I repeat, the Kalki crystal
has been discovered.

00:19:48.504 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I'll follow him.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Mount Shasta is
most famous for being

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
where the headwaters of
the Sacramento River begin.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.515 align:middle line:84%
Much of the water that
California drinks, washes

00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
their cars with, bathes
their children in,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:84%
begins right here
on this mountain.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:53.207 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.207 --> 00:20:56.658 align:middle line:84%
>>Does the name Kalki
mean anything to you?

00:20:56.658 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I never heard of him.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Hmph.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.525 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.525 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm Mary.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.595 align:middle line:90%
And this is Albert.

00:21:06.595 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.455 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:21:20.455 --> 00:21:23.425 align:middle line:90%
>>Um, I'm hiking through town.

00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:38.714 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>There's someone
you should meet.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.047 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.047 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, come on.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, come on.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:90%
You'd go with her too.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Thinking back on
that whole thing,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
this was the first time I had
felt something stir inside me.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It was something
different, something real.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The objective
has been achieved.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.232 align:middle line:84%
Footage clearly shows that the
Kalki crystal has been found.

00:22:27.232 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.496 align:middle line:90%
>>So you think you are done?

00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:36.662 align:middle line:90%
>>That was my understanding.

00:22:36.662 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.668 align:middle line:90%
>>There's always more to do.

00:22:42.668 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, sir.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>We must take all the
steps necessary to find

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:90%
him and remove him.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:10%
>>Why don't I just take
the crystal from the kid?

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:59.332 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't be all that difficult.

00:22:59.332 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>You don't understand.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.524 align:middle line:84%
It's not the crystal we
need to be worried about.

00:23:07.524 --> 00:23:08.607 align:middle line:90%
It's the man who found it.

00:23:08.607 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
If the prophecy's are
correct, he is Kalki.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And if he is Kalki,
he has returned

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:90%
with one mission in mind.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Kalki's not here to
teach us or to change us.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the ignorant
masses, Kalki

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:90%
knows that we rule the world.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.066 align:middle line:84%
He is here to completely
obliterate us.

00:23:38.066 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:46.996 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, none
of our kind will remain.

00:23:46.996 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
The ignorant rabble
will steal everything,

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
ruin everything that we
have built in our 6,000 year

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:90%
dominion over the world.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Who will control
the world order?

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:84%
No police, no security, no
war, no controlled population.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Even if he isn't Kalki,
it does not matter.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
If there is the slightest
chance that he is Kalki,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you must find him
and terminate him.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.032 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:24:36.032 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, sir.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:40.409 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:24:40.409 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Feel really good
about this one.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Check out his crystal.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.435 align:middle line:90%
Looks like the one in the book.

00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about his eyes.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.004 align:middle line:90%
>>Very similar.

00:25:07.004 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.969 align:middle line:90%
Where did you find it?

00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:11.594 align:middle line:90%
>>On the trail.

00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:90%
It was just hanging there.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:90%
I ran into it.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.587 align:middle line:90%
Somebody must have left it.

00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:20.628 align:middle line:90%
>>Or left it for someone.

00:25:20.628 --> 00:25:26.046 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:26.545 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:25:26.545 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Jack O'Ryan.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a big question.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:53.831 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Anger, distrust.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.066 align:middle line:90%
He's too dark to be Kalki.

00:25:59.066 --> 00:26:05.661 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:06.327 align:middle line:90%
>>What was that?

00:26:06.327 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>I thought you
might be someone.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.878 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:26:12.878 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.618 align:middle line:90%
Have a safe trip.

00:26:20.618 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>More like an acid trip.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Is she like a mind-reader?

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.286 align:middle line:84%
Has everybody on this
mountain gone wonky?

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.535 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, first, I mean a
guy who thinks he knows me,

00:26:30.535 --> 00:26:31.855 align:middle line:90%
now this?

00:26:31.855 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's something
in the water.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you-- you guys are smoking
something, and then not telling

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Because I-- you can share.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.758 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool.

00:26:40.758 --> 00:26:43.862 align:middle line:84%
>>Jack, do you believe that
the universe is infinite?

00:26:43.862 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if the
universe is infinite,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:84%
then we live in a world
of infinite choices.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>I've never met
anybody like you.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Open your mind, Jack.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
You can become whoever
it is you wanna be.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>It did look like
the crystal, but I'm

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
afraid we're going to
have to keep looking.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Mary37 again.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for all your
great messages.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I posted them all on
kalkiwhereareyou.com.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Like I said in my last
post, I had this dream

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:90%
that I was gonna meet Kalki.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I did meet someone, and
I thought he was the one.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.244 align:middle line:90%
But we're still looking.

00:27:51.244 --> 00:27:53.645 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.645 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
work to be done,

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're gonna need everyone's
help when he gets here.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.208 align:middle line:90%
But we still have to find him.

00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>There's a guy in town.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:90%
I think he has the crystal.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Mary brought him by.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:90%
He's too dark to be Kalki.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Sarah, you know that only
Kalki can find that crystal.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:90%
You've got the book.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.246 align:middle line:90%
Look it up.

00:28:25.246 --> 00:28:32.005 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.005 --> 00:28:32.995 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey.

00:28:32.995 --> 00:28:33.985 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey.

00:28:33.985 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Where's your costume?

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you coming to the
Halloween parade with me?

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Right, the parade.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.218 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.218 --> 00:28:44.968 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream about
the parade last night.

00:28:44.968 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The guy with the funny hat,
he was trying to stop Jack.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>We'll go check it out.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:34.046 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.046 --> 00:29:36.536 align:middle line:84%
>>Somehow, I found my way to
Shasta's Halloween parade.

00:29:36.536 --> 00:29:44.006 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:46.496 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't like this.

00:29:46.496 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:90%
You stay away from him.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Understand?

00:29:47.990 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I did not succeed
in removing him,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.767 align:middle line:84%
and I did not
recover the crystal.

00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.359 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I-- I won't let you down again.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:31:27.761 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Kalki will destroy
the enemies of truth,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and bring about the
birth of the next age.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:39.350 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>So you were beaten
by one of the locals?

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.344 align:middle line:90%
>>With a cane?

00:31:50.344 --> 00:31:53.214 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, sir.

00:31:53.214 --> 00:31:55.334 align:middle line:90%
>>Useless.

00:31:55.334 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:90%
You've lost your edge.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:84%
You know the price
that you have to pay.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead!

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:32.407 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.407 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Shut the door.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.474 align:middle line:90%
>>DISC agents?

00:33:54.474 --> 00:33:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>We have to help him.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:17.727 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.727 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Who are you?

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:23.744 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.744 --> 00:34:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm Kalki.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.708 align:middle line:90%
>>Who is Kalki?

00:34:26.708 --> 00:35:06.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>What have you been
doing out there?

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.163 align:middle line:90%
>>Hiking, getting stronger.

00:35:12.163 --> 00:35:13.246 align:middle line:90%
>>Getting strong, are you?

00:35:13.246 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.418 align:middle line:90%
Come over here, Jack.

00:35:17.418 --> 00:35:18.001 align:middle line:90%
Shake my hand.

00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:27.469 align:middle line:90%


00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I thought you said you
were getting strong, Jack.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:44.045 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.045 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>What is this?

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>If you were getting
strong, this couldn't happen.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:12.934 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.934 --> 00:36:13.434 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:36:13.434 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:20.366 align:middle line:84%
You were always looking for
something, Jack, a woman,

00:36:20.366 --> 00:36:26.378 align:middle line:90%
a drug, a job, a savior.

00:36:26.378 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.484 align:middle line:90%
>>How are you doing this?

00:36:31.484 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Jack, you're more
than flesh and blood.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.668 align:middle line:84%
You're immersed in a
river of invisible energy.

00:36:44.668 --> 00:36:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It's called a light body.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's within you and without.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.142 align:middle line:90%
It informs you, celebrates you.

00:36:54.142 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It co-creates with you.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.161 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.161 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:90%
It's your friend, Jack.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:00.875 align:middle line:90%
It's your ally.

00:37:00.875 --> 00:37:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I can see you're going to need
a little more time with this.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:38:05.822 align:middle line:90%


00:38:05.822 --> 00:38:07.285 align:middle line:90%
>>This is some kind of trick.

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.135 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not a trick, Jack.

00:38:12.135 --> 00:38:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It-- it's the force
that drives everything.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the force that
lights up the galaxies,

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:90%
causes the sun to burn.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why nothing
can be living or dead.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
living all the time.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the force
that animates you,

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that gives you your
attractiveness, your power,

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:90%
or-- or your lack of it.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Jack, this force, this
force fills everything.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It flows through everything,
the animals, people, everything

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:90%
that is, seen and unseen.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't regulate the force.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It can be siphoned off.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:90%
The force is what it is.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:90%
It's constant.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%

I was surprised,

01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
think about all the
people in the world who

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.560 align:middle line:84%
don't have television, don't
have computers, iPhones?

How are they going to get
the Kalki transmission, huh?

I figured that if I reached
10% of the population,

the transmission
