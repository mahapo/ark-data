them closer to their
source of sustenance.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether it's
air, or food, or water,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that they understand where
that nourishment comes from.

of that soul nourishment.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
spiritual nourishment.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
this is the place we've been
looking for all these years.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he's
my best friend.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Someone I've never
met the like of.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
He loves to share his
thoughts, he's a thinker.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
He came up with this vision,
but it grew into something

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that he saw as a tool
that transforms people.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So this vision of
putting the scythe

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
into millions of people's
hands, it just sort of grew,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.785 align:middle line:84%
and it inspired the rest of
us to help with this idea.

00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.616 align:middle line:84%

to the farm from somewhere

In just a few minutes,
make a sort of a blank.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Like a half product.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.048 align:middle line:84%
I sort it out in
different sizes.

00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:90%
This is the traditional way.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.719 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go like this.

00:12:56.719 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
different-- you know,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
there's differences in--
some have longer shanks,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
some have different
angles on them.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'll pick one that
fits into a certain hold.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Here a grip, which
is either more steep,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
like this, or more
nearly 90 degrees.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But I don't like
90 degree grips.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.745 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I always
criticize them.

00:13:26.745 --> 00:13:33.001 align:middle line:84%
You know, or a grip
that has this shape.

00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And they're all different.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
They have different
curvatures both ways.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Here's another grip,
just by chance, you know,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.754 align:middle line:84%
that that is like, to me,
it's got a lot of character,

00:13:45.754 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like,
well, that would be--

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.961 align:middle line:84%
how would you hold
that in your hand?

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But when you take
it in your hand,

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.505 align:middle line:84%
this grip actually is almost
like-- it's very comfortable.

00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Look in your hand.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Only, well, you can't eh?

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's got
a place for a thumb.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.345 align:middle line:90%
It's curved this way.

00:14:02.345 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:90%
It does not slide around.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to squeeze it.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's got character,
it's just a pretty,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's just a
rough piece of wood.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I hardly have to
do anything to it.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
The tree grew it like that.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's all not just hippity
hop, fitting things together

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
into holes, but it's
a certain relationship

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
that can be technically
substantiated.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can
explain it at length,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
of what makes me pick
one grip over another,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have enough
time for that right now.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:44.206 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
What I always do before I--
even if the blade is very clean,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
like it's being
used all the time,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.175 align:middle line:84%
I use this sanding
block made in Germany.

00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:58.912 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.912 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And I run over the
very last three, four,

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:90%
five millimeters of the edge.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And it gives it a
certain matte finish.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.288 align:middle line:90%
I'm back up into the last piece.

00:15:29.288 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm-- I'm putting the
first row of strokes on it.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Go right to the very--
you like cutting,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.782 align:middle line:90%
just around-- go towards there.

00:16:06.782 --> 00:16:07.455 align:middle line:90%
The bale.

00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And start moving in
that same direction.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And open a place behind.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And then Jonathan
should follow you,

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
because he's also going
ahead and moving the stuff

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.005 align:middle line:90%
to the left of the uncut grass.

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>What I'm going to
do is move my hand--

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
or rather, move the blade
through my hand, inching along,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and my hands are in
approximately the same place,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
so that it's comfortable, and
I'm not reaching way up here.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So, and this should be done
at least every five minutes.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
More of the dents
are going to be up.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:90%
This is more unusual.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It's because you caught a piece
of wire that was in the ground.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do here, is tap it.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Ah, the tang is in the way here.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.855 align:middle line:84%
We're going to tap this
with a hammer, right there.

00:16:57.855 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>You don't want to
overdo this, right?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.938 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you have to just
re-ping the whole thing, right?

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.108 align:middle line:84%
>>So here, we've
kind of-- you can

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:07.399 align:middle line:90%
feel the way that smoothed out.

00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>I see it, I see it.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>How is this grip?

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Just like that.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.264 align:middle line:90%
And you put that left one--

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not here.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It's-- it's up.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
>>If you were in
a competition, you

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:90%
might hold it the other way.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.624 align:middle line:84%
But just that way, and put
it-- let that hand slide

00:17:16.624 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:84%
up and down, wherever it
feels most comfortable.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're lifting the blades
like this, doing this,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to cut that out.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.809 align:middle line:84%
This is all detached
from last year,

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:28.810 align:middle line:84%
so this just kind of makes
you to keep the blade down

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.965 align:middle line:84%
>>This lifestyle that we
live feels right to me.

00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, both from an
intellectual viewpoint,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%
and from just a feeling.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
When you're using a scythe,
you're much more in tune

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
with the grass, the trees,
the wind, the birds,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:90%
the weather conditions.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:90%
and with the earth.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have that
real connection

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't happen
when you're sitting

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:90%
on a tractor or a lawnmower.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Apart from the fact
that you're doing this

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
without using fossil
fuels, and you're

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
helping your body
to stay healthy.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
This work that we're doing
is about more than just

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%
the scythe.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The scythe is a symbol of the
type of the kind of lifestyle

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:90%
that we want to promote.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Living more simply, making a
smaller ecological footprint

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:84%
on the earth, living
more mindfully.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The scythe represents all
of those things to us.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>You're 18, so I'm 19.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Your number's 19 now.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yep.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Yep.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, be ready.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Stand back now.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Vance did this before, one time.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:90%
On three.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.195 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three!

00:18:40.195 --> 00:19:28.384 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:31.735 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
If I had to make this
hay-- look at this,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't even have to windrow it.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.106 align:middle line:90%
It's all ready to go.

00:19:38.106 --> 00:19:39.942 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you very, very much.

00:19:39.942 --> 00:19:40.442 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks.

00:19:40.442 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks a lot.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.732 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:43.732 --> 00:19:44.648 align:middle line:90%
>>Look at that.

00:19:44.648 --> 00:19:45.564 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:19:45.564 --> 00:19:47.341 align:middle line:90%
How she laid that hay up?

00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:47.841 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:19:47.841 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:90%
