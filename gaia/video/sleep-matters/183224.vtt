00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:03.082 align:middle line:84%
A circadian clock
is only so flexible.

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:05.784 align:middle line:84%
It can change timezones,
for example, when we travel.

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It takes several days to
move to a new time zone.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.089 align:middle line:84%
The same problem is
experienced when we rapidly

00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:13.692 align:middle line:84%
change our sleep rate patterns
between days of the week.

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:16.729 align:middle line:84%
So for example, someone who
irregularly works night shifts

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:21.033 align:middle line:84%

00:23:35.114 --> 00:23:37.416 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel like
I'm fading a bit.

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.955 align:middle line:84%

00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:59.305 align:middle line:84%
Hau's night shift doesn't really
affect him if he catches up

>> Yeah, I am the
mother of dragons.

After a hearty dinner, it's
time to head to the cook house.

00:50:15.913 --> 00:50:19.583 align:middle line:84%
Scientists now know that having
a sauna, warm bath, shower,

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:22.386 align:middle line:84%
or even a foot bath around
an hour before going to bed

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:26.190 align:middle line:84%
helps us get off
to sleep faster.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.259 align:middle line:90%
It's hot.

00:50:28.259 --> 00:50:31.595 align:middle line:84%
It works like this, the
heat rises body temperature,

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:35.633 align:middle line:84%
bringing blood vessels to
the surface of the skin.

00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:36.433 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:39.837 align:middle line:84%
Warm blood loses heat to the
air, cooling the body core.

00:50:39.837 --> 00:50:42.072 align:middle line:84%
And this replicates
what happens at bedtime,

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:46.110 align:middle line:84%
when a drop of one degree
or so helps initiate sleep.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:48.045 align:middle line:90%
Right, time for beddy-byes.

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:58.789 align:middle line:84%
OK, welcome to my
little bedroom,

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.824 align:middle line:90%
my boudoir for tonight.

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:02.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very cozy.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.229 align:middle line:84%
I've had an absolutely
fantastic day here

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:08.065 align:middle line:90%
at Meg and Patrick's place.

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:09.533 align:middle line:84%
And tonight I'm
going to try to see

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:13.270 align:middle line:84%
if I can have the best
sleep of my life here

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.472 align:middle line:90%
in this tiny little hut.

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:18.409 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to use
any mobile phones.

00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
check social media.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.013 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the batteries on my
phone are completely dead.

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.982 align:middle line:84%
So I'm basically
living their lifestyle,

00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:28.652 align:middle line:84%
which is self-reliance, growing
their own food, and most

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:31.822 align:middle line:84%
importantly, not using any
unnecessary technology.

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:32.623 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:32.623 --> 00:51:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Wish me luck.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.458 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you in the morning.

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:54.645 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:08.192 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think I had
a really good sleep.

00:52:08.192 --> 00:52:11.028 align:middle line:84%
And I was woken up
by the kookaburras.

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:15.265 align:middle line:84%
Their birdsong is probably a
lot more pleasant than the alarm

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:17.434 align:middle line:90%
that I have in my phone.

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:20.337 align:middle line:84%
So that was a lovely
way to wake up.

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't know if it's the best
sleep I've ever had in my life

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:26.110 align:middle line:90%
but it was definitely up there.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Now it's time to get up.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.315 align:middle line:90%
It's really cold.

00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:32.249 align:middle line:90%

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:38.655 align:middle line:84%
So maybe if I at least turned
off my phone and screens

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:40.657 align:middle line:84%
and went to bed with
the stars once a week,

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:41.959 align:middle line:90%
I'd get a better night's sleep.

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.466 align:middle line:84%
I began this journey
as a person who

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.336 align:middle line:84%
thought about getting
more sleep, a lot.

00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:54.838 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't
do anything about it.

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:57.441 align:middle line:84%
Then I discovered that my
memory can improve even

00:52:57.441 --> 00:52:59.576 align:middle line:90%
after just a 90 minute nap--

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:01.912 align:middle line:84%
>> You showed 80%
improvement post-nap.

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:02.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:06.116 align:middle line:84%
--that living a life against
your internal biological clock

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:09.453 align:middle line:84%
can lead to some
serious health issues,

00:53:09.453 --> 00:53:11.755 align:middle line:84%
and that putting sleep off
is possibly the worst thing

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:12.923 align:middle line:90%
you can do to your brain.

I'm struggling to stay awake.

00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to listen to my body
more and sleep like an athlete

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.103 align:middle line:90%
and a koala.

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:32.876 align:middle line:10%
So what I've learned is that
sleep is extremely important

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:39.316 align:middle line:10%
to make me the best person that
I can be for my waking wife,

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:45.522 align:middle line:10%
for my family, for my work,
for everything really.

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:48.058 align:middle line:10%
If you don't get
good sleep, you can't

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:52.396 align:middle line:10%
enjoy the most important things
in life when you're awake.
