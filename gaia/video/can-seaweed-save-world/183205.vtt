and a seaweed that's
pre-adapted to grow very

So what sort of
seaweed is this, Rocky?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a species of
seaweed called ulva.

And it's commonly
called sea lettuce.

is it grows in the intertidal.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's really adapted
to grow with a big range

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of temperature, really
strong sunlight,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.770 align:middle line:90%
and changes in salinity.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So as we go through the
growing seasons on the farm,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
it's robust, and
it keeps growing,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and it provides year-round
bioremediation that we

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:90%
need to maintain clean water.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%

you throw at it, basically.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.223 align:middle line:84%
>> It's quite amazing
in that regard.

00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a tough customer.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And how fast does it grow?

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Triple in a week.

00:06:56.797 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Tripling in a week in volume.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:84%

harvest every day.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%

this stuff grow so fast?

>> It's quite amazing, isn't it?

00:07:04.353 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's all photosynthetic.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So there are no structural
tissues holding it up.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
tree with a trunk.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's there
has the capacity to grow.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The faster it grows, the
more nitrogen, phosphorous,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.357 align:middle line:84%
and carbon are taken
out of the system.

00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we harvest that,
it's ready to repurpose.

>> So that's made from seaweed?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.807 align:middle line:90%
>> That's made from seaweed.

00:09:22.807 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And what percentage
of it is carbon?

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> 20% to 30%, depending
on how you make it.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
trying to do is also

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
make that carbon stay in that
soil for as long as possible.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you put the
biochar in the soil,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.557 align:middle line:84%
you're providing a long-term
benefit to soil structure

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and to nutrients, but you
have to make it the right way.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So there are a few
tricks in the process.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I can imagine.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
mastered those, you

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
can develop a product
that provides the carbon

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
benefit, and some fertilizer,
and some trace elements,

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and try and get the
best of everything.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So a little of the carbon
dioxide that was warming

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere has
now been captured,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And what we're really
doing here is growing them

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%

instead of digging them up

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:90%
out of the ground like fossils.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:90%

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%

just like leather.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%

the same seaweed.

the work going on here

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:84%

where are you
getting the CO2 from?

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:10%

For many years,
I've been involved

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in issues around climate
change, and right now,

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.455 align:middle line:84%
the levels of carbon dioxide in
our atmosphere are a problem.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where seaweed
might really help.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Seaweed grows by using the
sun's energy in photosynthesis.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And as it does so, it
takes carbon dioxide

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that's dissolved in the oceans
and builds its own tissues.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that
CO2 in the oceans

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:90%
has come from the atmosphere.

And this stuff can grow 60
meters a year in some cases.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot safer
locked up in seaweed

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
than it is in the
atmosphere or in the oceans.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if we covered
the oceans with seaweed farms

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:84%
whether we could draw
down enough carbon

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:90%

want to find out.

Could you farm seaweed
on the open ocean

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%

from the atmosphere?

Because to draw down

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:84%

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to be grown on a huge scale.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Professor Chung has given

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.140 align:middle line:84%
estimates of
seaweed crop yields.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And using those, I can estimate
that if you wanted to go down

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:84%
a gigaton of carbon, you'd
need to plant a seaweed

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:84%
farm around the size
of South Australia,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:90%
a million square kilometers.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to offset
all of human emissions,

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:84%
so draw down all
of the carbon we're

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:84%
putting in the atmosphere,
you'd need a seaweed

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:90%
farm the size of Asia.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:84%
That would be 9% of the world's
ocean covered in seaweed farms.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm going to
see that in my lifetime.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But I do think it's
realistic to look

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
at covering 1% of the world's
ocean in seaweed farms.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we did that,
we'd be pulling down

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:84%
5 gigatons of carbon
a year, and that

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:84%
would be an enormous
help in terms

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.170 align:middle line:90%
of addressing climate change.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:90%


00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Every year, we put
about 50 gigatons--

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:90%
that's 50 billion tons--

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:84%
of carbon dioxide or
equivalent into the atmosphere,

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:90%
where it causes climate change.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But seaweed can draw this
carbon out of the atmosphere.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Five gigatons would make
a noticeable difference.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.730 align:middle line:90%
20 would make a big one.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But if seaweeds
are going to help,

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
we need to grow them
in the open ocean.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And there's a snag.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Seaweeds photosynthesis
using the sun's energy,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.775 align:middle line:90%
but they also need nutrients.

00:38:11.775 --> 00:38:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the open
ocean, the nutrients

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.670 align:middle line:84%
are down too deep for the
seaweeds to reach them.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Growing seaweed in the
ocean will take great feats

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But scientists and
engineers are starting

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:90%
to work on the problem.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I've just came across this
rather extraordinary proposal.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.512 align:middle line:84%
It's being funded in part by the
Australian federal government.

00:38:35.512 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And it concerns the
development of what's

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
called a marine permaculture
array in the Indian Ocean.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that array will consist
of a 100-meters-squared grid

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that will be used to grow
seaweed and other seafood.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.600 align:middle line:84%
What's amazing about it is it'll
be operating in the deep ocean.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It won't be tethered
to the bottom.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.240 align:middle line:90%
It will be guided by satellites.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And out there in the
deep ocean, there's

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
no seaweed growing now
because there's no nutrients.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So whoever's put this
together has found a way

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to access those deep nutrients
and feed the seaweeds

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.400 align:middle line:90%
in these permaculture arrays.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.730 align:middle line:84%
To find out just how they're
pulling up the nutrients,

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking to the man behind
the plan, eco-entrepreneur Dr.

00:39:16.195 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:10%
On our marine permaculture,
we run a long pipe

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.450 align:middle line:10%
down several hundred
meters into the sea.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.820 align:middle line:10%
That's where the nutrients are.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And we pump them
up to the seaweed

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:10%
with a combination of wind,
and wave, and solar power.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:10%
We're estimating that for
an investment of around $5

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:10%
million, we can see a potential
for yields of $1 million

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:10%
for the kelp biomass,
and another million

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.090 align:middle line:10%

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.300 align:middle line:10%

in the open ocean, and whether
it can deliver a result.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.900 align:middle line:84%

And to draw down a

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%

that all the seaweed will
sink to the ocean bottom

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.810 align:middle line:84%
where it stays
out of harm's way.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm meeting a
scientist with doubts,

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:08.010 align:middle line:84%
an expert in how carbon is
stored, not in the ocean

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:90%
but in wetlands.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's not so sure the
deep ocean will easily

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:16.320 align:middle line:84%
store the carbon from seaweed,
sometimes called macroalgae.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about
this potential opportunity

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:90%
for seaweed farming?

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:24.800 align:middle line:84%
If we take this seaweed and
sink it into the deep ocean,

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.660 align:middle line:84%
is that carbon going to stay
there effectively forever?

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got some
reservations, admittedly.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.317 align:middle line:10%
Does it end up going
into the sediments,

00:41:32.317 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:10%
and does it end up getting
preserved in those sediments?

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.200 align:middle line:10%
I think that's the
big research gap.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to see some research
and data that we see that

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:84%
macroalgae end up in
those deep sea areas.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.350 align:middle line:90%
But does something munch it up?

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Fair enough.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:84%
If seaweed is munched up before
it gets to the deep ocean,

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:84%
its carbon can return
to the atmosphere.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to reach the
deep ocean fast, or be buried

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.240 align:middle line:84%
in ocean sediments where it's
safe from the microbes that

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:90%
munch it up.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Sediments are a
natural carbon store,

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and Peter shows me how
they work in mangrove mud.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The microbes just can't
really attack the carbon,

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.922 align:middle line:84%
so it's the perfect place
to store our carbon.

00:42:13.922 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And the bottom
of the core here,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.240 align:middle line:90%
how old do you think this is?

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, if we have one
centimeter a year of accretion,

00:42:19.627 --> 00:42:21.210 align:middle line:84%
let's say that's
about 60 centimeters,

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
so maybe 60 years
old, about that.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So that carbon really
has been safely stored there

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.110 align:middle line:84%
for as long as I've
been alive, anyway.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that is
very convincing.

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:84%
In this mangrove
mud, it's too cold,

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and there's not enough
oxygen for the microbes

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.550 align:middle line:84%
to munch up the
carbon stored here.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And these ecosystems will
store the carbon in the ground

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.360 align:middle line:90%

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.155 align:middle line:84%
They retire it from
the carbon cycle,

00:42:44.155 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:84%
grabbing it out
of the atmosphere

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.822 align:middle line:90%
and putting it into the ground.

00:42:46.822 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a watery grave,
and it'll stay there.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Mangroves are clearly a
great place to store carbon,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
but they're relatively
few in number.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:84%
To store all the carbon we need
to draw out of the atmosphere,

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:90%
something much bigger is needed.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
So can the deep oceans do it?

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:90%
The answers won't come easily.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:14.020 align:middle line:84%
The deep ocean is more alien
than anything on Earth.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But if seaweed gets
into the deep ocean,

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.710 align:middle line:90%
there should be evidence of it.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:84%
One team has scoured deep sea
surveys from around the world,

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and they think
there is evidence.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:10%
>> And we were surprised to
find many records of seaweeds

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.540 align:middle line:10%
in the deep ocean, on
the deep sea floor,

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.860 align:middle line:10%
several thousand meters down.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.990 align:middle line:10%
So not only are they able to
be exported there, but also

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:10%
really fast, since
they're not decomposed

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:10%
before getting there.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.710 align:middle line:10%
That's deeper than
one kilometer.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:10%
Then we talk about
it being sequestered

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:10%

That's fantastic, Dorte.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Dorte thinks that 173 million
tons of seaweed carbon

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.600 align:middle line:84%
is naturally sequestered in
ocean sediment every year,

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:90%
90% in the deep oceans.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Dorte's study is showing
that lots of coastal seaweed

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.732 align:middle line:84%
is already finding its
way into the deep ocean,

00:44:12.732 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and that the carbon
in that seaweed

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:18.132 align:middle line:84%
is staying down there out of
the atmospheric carbon cycle.

I guess the big
thing we don't know

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.510 align:middle line:84%
is, if we do this on
an industrial scale

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and grow seaweed farms that are
transporting lots of seaweed

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
into the deep oceans, what the
consequence of that will be.

>> Yeah, looking at it, I'm
quite amazed by how it looks,

00:47:37.585 --> 00:47:38.470 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So it will be really
interesting to how

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.562 align:middle line:90%
the tests go with it all.

00:47:40.562 --> 00:47:45.370 align:middle line:10%
And if it can get the same
strength ratings as bricks,

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.620 align:middle line:10%
I can't see why there's--
what the limitations to this

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.550 align:middle line:10%
material would be.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Sustainability is something
that is in the agenda.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:10%
And we have the responsibility
to actually tell

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.930 align:middle line:10%
the client this exists,
and we could use it,

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.400 align:middle line:10%
and these are the benefits.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And perhaps this is how
we push back against climate

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.500 align:middle line:90%
change, brick by brick.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I've taken this journey to find
out if this humble weed could

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.150 align:middle line:90%
save the world.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there we go.

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
healthy-looking specimen.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh yeah, that's a
beautiful fish, isn't it?

00:48:22.887 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I've see how we could be
feeding the world on protein

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.940 align:middle line:84%
from seafood farmed with
the help of seaweed--

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So what volume can you
put through this plant?

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.257 align:middle line:84%
--how seaweed could help
clean up polluted water--

00:48:33.257 --> 00:48:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> A million liters a day.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> A million liters a day.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Go through this?

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> --how seaweed carbon
can be stored in biochar--

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful stuff there.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:84%
--and could help reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:44.770 align:middle line:90%
cattle--

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you can feed
seaweed to cows,

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and they reduce their
production of methane.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the many unlikely
things that could be used

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:52.880 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at this one.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:54.890 align:middle line:90%
It's just like leather.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So this as a
building material.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a building material.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But I've been most excited
by the potential to grow seaweed

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.810 align:middle line:84%
to slow climate change by
absorbing carbon dioxide from

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere in
huge, open-ocean farms.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Wow, the scale of this
is almost unbelievable.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I think these technologies hint
at solutions our world needs.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:20.750 align:middle line:90%
But how much might they help?

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.055 align:middle line:90%


00:49:23.055 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So Tim, you've been all
over the world looking at this

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.820 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to know
what it all adds up to.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've got to
get some numbers down.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:30.085 align:middle line:90%
>> We do, yeah, yeah.

00:49:30.085 --> 00:49:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, why don't
we pop in here?

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Try and see if we can
find a room, and we'll--

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> --we'll get it down.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Adam's a carbon economy
and innovation expert.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We can't be exact,
but some estimates

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.840 align:middle line:84%
will help gauge the potential
of the technologies I've seen.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So Adam, I'd love to get some
figures around these areas

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to see how much carbon we
could sequester from seaweed.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, good call.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's an interesting
one for protein.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It seems like if people change
their diets, potentially,

00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:01.880 align:middle line:84%
we can actually use sustainable
fish associated with these

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:08.690 align:middle line:84%
seaweed farms that could produce
around about 11.8ish gigatons

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:09.803 align:middle line:90%
of savings per year.

00:50:09.803 --> 00:50:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That is a massive number.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:11.928 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a big number.

00:50:11.928 --> 00:50:12.728 align:middle line:90%
>> That's huge.

00:50:12.728 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is assuming that
9 billion people on Earth each

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.930 align:middle line:84%
eat 200 kilograms
of fish a year.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:17.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So probably it's going to be
quite a bit less than that.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we say maybe it's
going to be a third of that.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.690 align:middle line:90%
So let's call it three?

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe three.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, three, yeah,
that sounds good.

00:50:25.685 --> 00:50:27.402 align:middle line:90%
>> So three gigatons per year.

00:50:27.402 --> 00:50:28.985 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're then
looking at feedstock.

00:50:28.985 --> 00:50:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of the figures
I've seen are huge.

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It seemed like something
around about 2.4 gigatons.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:90%
per year saved.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> See, these are very
big savings, Adam,

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
much bigger than I was thinking
you'd be getting from that.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> If all of the cattle in the
world ate a bit of seaweed.

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's encouraging.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very good.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be good, yeah.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.665 align:middle line:84%
>> So the other area we
were looking at was biochar.

00:50:48.665 --> 00:50:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It is incredibly promising,
because it's not just

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.610 align:middle line:84%
sequestering the
carbon, it's also

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.027 align:middle line:84%
helping productivity
in nutrients.

00:50:54.027 --> 00:50:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't be averse
to sort of a very,

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.490 align:middle line:84%
very rounded preliminary
figure of one.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> One.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.290 align:middle line:90%
All right, well, let's--

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm thinking one gigaton.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.842 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so we're going
to put on a gigaton there.

00:51:03.842 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the other thing we
saw is of course manufacture

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.425 align:middle line:90%
of plastics, clothing.

00:51:08.425 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:84%
What sort of
figures do you think

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.883 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at for that?

00:51:10.883 --> 00:51:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Plastics and clothing, it's--
it's difficult to understand.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But of course you
also don't have

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.635 align:middle line:84%
to use oil for the
plastics and clothing now.

00:51:17.635 --> 00:51:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of saving there.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:20.385 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
sequestering of it,

00:51:20.385 --> 00:51:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is the supplanting of these
emissions we have right now.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Pfft, why don't we stick
on a gigaton for each?

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds reasonable.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.003 align:middle line:90%
I think that's good.

00:51:27.003 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's do that.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.268 align:middle line:84%
>> And finally, this
issue of storage,

00:51:30.268 --> 00:51:31.810 align:middle line:84%
which I think is
one of the big ones,

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of if we can sink the seaweed
down below a kilometer

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.480 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean, it's
stored permanently.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it, 9% of the
ocean, we could store--

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.110 align:middle line:84%
If you cover 9% of the world's
ocean in seaweed farms,

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:84%
you could offset all of current
emissions, so 53 gigatons.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> 53 gigatons.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, potentially, which is--

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a lot.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's everything
we emit right now,

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.750 align:middle line:90%
which would be amazing.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.515 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a huge
amount of ocean mass.

00:51:52.515 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like a seaweed
farm the size of Asia,

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.540 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of--

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really big.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:58.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if we took a
tenth of that, and say,

00:51:58.948 --> 00:52:00.740 align:middle line:84%
let's say a tenth, that
would be ambitious.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.775 align:middle line:84%
But a tenth is still
live five gigatons, huh?

00:52:02.775 --> 00:52:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's put that in.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Give it a go.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what do we get there?

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We got five, six, seven,
eight, 10.4, 13.4 gigatons.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course 13 billion
tons is just an estimate.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But if this were
possible, then it

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.148 align:middle line:84%
would have an impact
on climate change.

00:52:24.148 --> 00:52:25.440 align:middle line:90%
This is not an impossible task.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> These are real.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.500 align:middle line:90%
They can happen now.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Biodegradable plastics
from seaweed, new feedstocks.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.337 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is a big future.

00:52:32.337 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is exciting.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to work.

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:35.874 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Tim.

to bear fruit than others.

But scaling up any
of these concepts

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.810 align:middle line:84%

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.830 align:middle line:84%
We humans are
really intelligent.

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it seems to me
we can do almost anything.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.810 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to climate
change and seaweed,

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:15.006 align:middle line:84%
I think we're really
onto something.

00:53:15.006 --> 00:53:17.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.480 align:middle line:84%
My last stop is the
most personal of all.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Alecia Bellgrove
is a seaweed scientist

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.850 align:middle line:84%
who's developing a
project to farm seaweed

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:31.990 align:middle line:84%
right here in Melbourne's
Port Phillip Bay.

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.680 align:middle line:90%
It's where I grew up.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to see it once
again the flourishing habitat

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.870 align:middle line:90%
I remember as a child.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, you know, this place used
to be my playground as a kid.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there's
huge possibility.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.490 align:middle line:10%
So we need to think
carefully about where

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:51.410 align:middle line:10%
we're farming the
seaweeds, what we're

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.960 align:middle line:10%
going to do with the
seaweeds once we harvest them

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.630 align:middle line:10%
from those farms.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:59.480 align:middle line:84%
My concern as an
ecologist and someone

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.430 align:middle line:84%
that's also really excited
about the prospects

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that seaweed farming
can bring is that we

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:06.560 align:middle line:90%
need to just tread cautiously.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And we can often go into
things hammer and tongs

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:13.073 align:middle line:84%
before we understand fully how
these things-- systems work.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Ocean farms are
yet to be tested.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But I feel they present a big
opportunity for Australia,

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.615 align:middle line:84%
especially as our seaweed
stocks are so rich.

00:54:26.615 --> 00:54:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're sitting in a part
of the world that has got

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.760 align:middle line:90%
the highest biodiversity.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is a hotspot of
biodiversity for seaweeds.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.160 align:middle line:84%
There's more seaweeds in
southeastern Australia

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.450 align:middle line:84%
than there is in any
other part of the world.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:90%
So the potential is huge.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:43.120 align:middle line:84%
The understanding of what
we've got is very small.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you be surprised
if, within 500 meters of us,

00:54:46.427 --> 00:54:49.010 align:middle line:84%
there was a species of seaweed
that hadn't been described yet.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Not at all.

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So just projecting
out 50 years,

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.200 align:middle line:84%
how important do you think
the seaweeds growing within

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.220 align:middle line:84%
a kilometer of us
here are going to be.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they've got
huge potential to be part

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.988 align:middle line:90%
of our food security solutions.

00:55:01.988 --> 00:55:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Sounds to me is if you think
we've got a national treasure

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.330 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> When I think about what
wonders might be found

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.200 align:middle line:84%
in Australia's seaweed
treasure trove,

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.080 align:middle line:90%
it brings me a lot of hope.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.840 align:middle line:84%
The age of seaweed
may be upon us,

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and I can't wait to see these
solutions start to unfold.
