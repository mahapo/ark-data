it's a technique

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
is utilizing people going
into a trance-like state.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:84%

another projecting themselves

over tens of thousands
of kilometers

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%

the feeling for
the place-- doing

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
the notes, and the photographs,
and the measurements;

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd often become
aware of the fact

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:90%
that I was being looked at.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.744 align:middle line:90%
And I'd do the old trick.

00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd just try and whip around
quickly to see who was there.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But there was
never anyone there.

we're all in at the moment

natural shape enhanced

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
by the spirit which resides
within the human body.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But we are, after all,
part of the Earth.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
We're part of
Papatuanuku-- the Mother

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Earth-- we're part of Gaia.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that if we're
able to open ourselves

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to these possibilities
when we're within nature,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
then we'll start to
observe ourselves--

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:90%
we'll start to get the feeling.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We'll start to
hear the messages.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:90%
We'll start to hear the song.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>We are developing an
awareness and a range of talents

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
that we've hardly touched.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is becoming
more and more common.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.215 align:middle line:84%
So without even
trying, some people

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:84%
are seeing things that
they haven't seen before

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and feeling things they
haven't felt before.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
And it's rather like
what's happening

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:84%
is that we're
extending our senses.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing,
boom-crash, a group of people

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
came flying out of some
vegetation beside the road.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:90%
I had my daughter alongside.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.522 align:middle line:84%
And we were both quite amazed
to see 15 people burst out

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of these bushes walking
single file very quickly

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
up toward the
summit of Tua Maori.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that was remarkable to me

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
was that they were
wearing loin clothes.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:15.239 align:middle line:84%
And the one woman that was with
the group of 13 men, one child

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:90%
was brunette.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
The rest of them were blonde--
slightly wavy, curly hair--

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
sort of like the
stuff that you see

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
emblazoned onto
the Greek statues.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
They were a bluey, greeny-eyed
people from what I could see.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.379 align:middle line:84%
I stuck my hand out
the window and my head.

00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.904 align:middle line:84%
The woman had a
possum-skin halter.

00:09:40.904 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And I stuck my
arm out the window

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
in a big, wide
arc-- in a greeting.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
The woman and the child at
the end of the group turned.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The child looked very
apprehensive at first,

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
but then this feeling of
peacefulness came over his face

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
as they both turned and
walked back to the vehicle

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
where myself and my daughter
were-- still driving along

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:90%
very slowly.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And her arm went--
right arm went out

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
in a big, wide arc-- a
big smile on their face.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:90%
The child's face lit up.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything was all good.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I could tell that the men-folk
that were hidden up this track

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
knew of my presence, even
though no eye contact was made.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that their
backs didn't stiffen up,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.905 align:middle line:84%
even when the woman
and child turned around

00:10:29.905 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to come back toward
us to have a meeting.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:84%
With my daughter
alongside me in the car,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to expect.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept on
going, regretfully.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I wish I would have
turned around and stopped.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Over the years I've had a
number of people share stories

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like I remember the
story a lady told tell me

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago of the
time she was tramping

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:90%
on one of the main tracks.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And as she moved up the
track with her backpack on

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and her walking
stick, she became

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
aware of a sound in the
forest alongside her.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And she explained to me it
was like children laughing.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said I didn't
take much notice.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd only just
started on the track.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I assumed that
there may have

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
been children around
somewhere or something.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.431 align:middle line:84%
And away I went further and
further into the forest.

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:25.868 align:middle line:90%
[CHILDREN  LAUGHING]

00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, what's so funny?

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.188 align:middle line:90%
[CHILDREN  LAUGHING]

00:11:54.188 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>She said that's
when I realized

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't dealing
with children.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with
something else.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm often asked what is the
difference between Turehu

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and Patupairarehe, the names
that we use by ancient Maori

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:90%
to describe the forest dwellers.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference
in those names.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It just depends what
Iwi you come from

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and what term you use.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Turehu has sometimes
been interpreted

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:84%
as meaning people
more with red hair.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Patupairarehe describes
the fairy folk

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
of the forest who are
small in stature-- three

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.255 align:middle line:84%
to four-foot tall perhaps,
fair of complexion,

00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
and fair of hair.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And they are flute playing.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The putorino or the koauau
which are two flutes,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:84%
which are known
to Maori of today.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed
that they were taught,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:84%
the Maori were taught,
the flute-making skills

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:90%
by the Patupairarehe.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, so that then goes
in with the stories

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.689 align:middle line:84%
of them being taught how to
make fishing nets as well.

00:13:26.689 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Annette and I have made
plans to bring together

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:84%
a group of fellow researchers
to spend the night in a forest

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:84%
where we hope to have
a personal encounter.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:84%
The coordinates given to
us by the remote viewer

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
have directed us to a
specific forest location.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>What I have
heard is that there

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
have been several
attempts to make

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:84%
a documentary about this--
one by a TV channel.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these
attempts was shut down

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
by the Department
of Conservation.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>There has been a
degree of sensitivity.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.185 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of it is
that a lot of the stories

00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
are outside the
area of the forest.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we actually may
not and probably won't

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:90%
be filming in the forest at all.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll be at other
private forestry

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:84%
blocks in which we
are permitted access.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And so we'll have no trouble.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Over the years there have been
many sightings at our suggested

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
research location.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Yet, when we ask locals to
share their stories with us,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be a
general reluctance

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and an air of secrecy.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.625 align:middle line:84%
We are doing
something which I don'

00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:90%
think has ever been done before.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:84%
What I'm searching
for is whether or not

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
these people in the forests,
as I like to call them,

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:90%
exist in the physical form.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.349 align:middle line:84%
Are they indeed a
lost race of people?

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Are they out there?

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Have they been living
in these forested parts

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
of New Zealand for
all these years and we

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:90%
haven't stumbled across them?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Or they haven't
stumbled across us?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.555 align:middle line:84%
Or are they indeed truly a
mystical, mythical fairy folk

00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
who exist in another dimension,
in another little universe

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:90%
which is parallel to ours.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:90%
And on occasions we see them.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And occasions they see us.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I've set off on my
journey into the forest.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:84%
On my way I stop at the
workshop of dear friend

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Kerry Strongman,
a woodcarver who

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
wishes to give me
some offerings that

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
may entice the little people to
come and show themselves to us.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey!

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey!

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.654 align:middle line:90%
Hey brother.

00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm here.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.445 align:middle line:84%
>>I've got something
awesome for you.

00:15:39.445 --> 00:15:39.945 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:15:39.945 --> 00:15:41.778 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I know you're
on a special journey .

00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But I've got this
really awesome.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I've put this whole collection
of stuff to assist you.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
These are treasures that
I know that will help you

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
in your journey.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
It's important that I
contribute by giving you

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
as many things that will bring
forth these elusive people.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to let the world
know that they're here,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that they will manifest
themselves to us

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and maybe share a little
of their great wisdom.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.214 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.214 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
As you remember, I
spent a lot of time

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
with aboriginals in Australia.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were great
teachers to me.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
When I par-- when I parted
with them to come here,

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%
they made me the
gift of their hair.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Aye.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>And they wove it
together in this cord

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:90%
that we would be all joined.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that my old,
white whiskers are in there too.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.205 align:middle line:10%
But I was so humbled
when they gave this

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:10%
to me, when the women wove it.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:10%
All the tribal people that I
was with, it was a small group.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing very
sacred journeying with it.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But I included this
in the treasure box

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
because they taught
me a lot of what

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:90%
I know about spiritual things.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful to them.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that they journey with us.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's the box
to put that in.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Like all indigenous people,
I'm sure they're musical.

>>Yes, I wouldn't normally get
you to come over all the way

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:10%
to Auckland if it wasn't for
something really important.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I knew it would be
for something quite special.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:90%
I am sure.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh yeah, are you
ready to have a look?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>I can't wait.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah?

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Let us go.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.370 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously the
reenactment bit.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And a shot that we didn't use.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>And I've marked a circle.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.661 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, my gosh.

00:40:06.661 --> 00:40:07.160 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.435 align:middle line:84%
>>I saw it straight away when
I was uploading the footage.

00:40:14.435 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:24.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, and watch
the zoom in, Gary.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.745 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot more detail.

00:40:29.745 --> 00:40:30.286 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:40:30.286 --> 00:40:30.786 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, my--

00:40:30.786 --> 00:40:33.680 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.536 align:middle line:84%
>>And then there's
a little slow-mo--

00:40:36.536 --> 00:40:37.468 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.332 align:middle line:90%
>>Zoomed in.

00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, well, what
on earth is that?

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>So basically,
what do you think?

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>What can I think?

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:90%
This is just amazing.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And the fact we set
out to find something.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.140 align:middle line:90%
And we have.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.894 align:middle line:84%
What it is I can't
really say at this stage.

00:40:58.894 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have a
closer look at this.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:90%
But this is just amazing.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not an animal.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's not people.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.700 align:middle line:90%
There were no people there.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.235 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, so if it's not human,
and it's not an animal--

00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, what have we got?

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Then what is it?

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>What is it indeed?

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.730 align:middle line:90%
What is it indeed?

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:10%
>>I've been looking at
footage in New Zealand

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:10%
for about 30 years now--
photographs and footage

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:10%
of anomalous things
and anomalous objects.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly think that this
piece of footage is unusual.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It looks to me to be too bright
to be sunlight reflecting off

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:90%
leaves.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.830 align:middle line:84%
The patches of light are
too big and too bright.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:41.810 align:middle line:84%
They appear to intensify in
certain parts of the footage

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:90%
almost to the point of glowing.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:84%
There appear to be
several objects or figures

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that some closer to the
foreground, some behind,

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:57.030 align:middle line:84%
moving not in unison,
moving in random fashion.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.655 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
brain and the eye

00:41:58.655 --> 00:42:00.030 align:middle line:84%
can trick us into
believing we're

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.210 align:middle line:84%
seeing what we want
to believe is there.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So I can't categorically
state what it is.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But there is one point in the
footage where, to me, there

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.680 align:middle line:84%
is quite clearly a
rotation of something that

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.600 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a
large, white head.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.340 align:middle line:10%
We see a patch of
light side view

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:10%
and it appears to be an object.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we quite clearly
see that object rotate.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me that we're
not necessarily just looking

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.960 align:middle line:84%
at sunlight reflecting
off leaves in the forest,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.430 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at something
that's actually in there

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.740 align:middle line:90%
behind the trees moving.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:10%
I would suggest
that the footage be

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:10%
sent to a professional
photographic data analyst

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:10%
to have a closer look at it and
run it through their programs

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:10%
and see if they're
able to ascertain

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.980 align:middle line:10%
any further details
that might be useful.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly is anomalous
given the bush environment

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:90%
that this footage was taken in.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.280 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fit.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a very interesting
capture indeed.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:10%
The humanoid, to me,
is-- looks very--

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:10%
it's very small for one thing.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And the body is just
proportionally smaller

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.850 align:middle line:90%
than the head.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.575 align:middle line:84%
The head is not bulbous,
but it kind of almost

00:43:17.575 --> 00:43:18.820 align:middle line:90%
looks kind of block-headed.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.440 align:middle line:90%
This is what I call a Watcher.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:10%
A very close friend of mine,
who is also a photoanalyst,

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:10%
has been researching the
Sasquatch for about 30 years.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:10%
And he found one in New Zealand.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, it seems
like he found more than one,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:41.710 align:middle line:10%
but one really excellent
shot that is undeniable.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.000 align:middle line:10%
Now what I think
is going here is

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.110 align:middle line:10%
that there's a
symbiotic relationship

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:53.716 align:middle line:10%
between the Sasquatch
and the Watchers.

00:43:53.716 --> 00:43:56.174 align:middle line:10%
The Watchers, of course, are
looking out for the Sasquatch,

00:43:56.174 --> 00:43:59.660 align:middle line:10%
warning them of any
impending danger.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:10%
And the Sasquatch
are their protectors.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:08.220 align:middle line:10%
It's possible-- probable
based on the research

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:15.420 align:middle line:10%
I've done-- that these
creatures are inter-dimensional.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.550 align:middle line:10%
But they're becoming less so
at this time, and more of them

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:10%
are being seen.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>To our amazement,
psychic dowser Gordon

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:84%
had picked up on the whereabouts
of the beings about 15 minutes

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.775 align:middle line:84%
after the recording of
the anomalous footage.

00:44:30.775 --> 00:44:32.274 align:middle line:84%
>>You're looking
over your shoulder.

00:44:32.274 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:90%
What's behind us, Gordon?

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Someone is back there.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Back there?

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.635 align:middle line:84%
>>There's someone
back there now.

00:44:37.635 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll do distance of
the one behind us now.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.894 align:middle line:90%
About 52 meters.

00:44:41.894 --> 00:44:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>52 meters.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd be very surprised
if we even saw them today.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>In order to be successful
in life in our society

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:84%
as we have constructed
it, you have to fit in.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:59.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a set of
beliefs that are acceptable.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And the beliefs that
are primarily acceptable

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.170 align:middle line:84%
are things that can
be shown, and proved,

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and other people can
see for their own eyes.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:12.496 align:middle line:84%
>>As I arrive home, another
unexpected surprise awaits me.

00:45:12.496 --> 00:45:15.250 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Dear Mr. Cook, I've heard that
you're looking for information

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:84%
on the fairy folk or
the Patupairarehe.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I've enclosed photographs
of small skulls.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Measurements have shown that
these small skulls are indeed

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:90%
mature adult beings.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:84%
As you may be well aware,
due to cultural sensitivity,

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it is not permitted in New
Zealand to handle human bones,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.660 align:middle line:84%
or send them for
radiocarbon dating, or DNA.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I hope that this
information will help you

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:90%
in your invaluable research.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Kind regards, a supporter.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:51.357 align:middle line:90%


00:45:51.357 --> 00:45:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm feeling grateful
for the answers

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been given
during this quest.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:10%
Yet I'm also amazed at
how, in this day and age,

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.335 align:middle line:10%
there's still so much
secrecy around subjects

00:46:00.335 --> 00:46:03.040 align:middle line:10%
that should be transparent.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:10%
For it is my belief that the
truth will sit all creatures

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.220 align:middle line:10%
free, both humans
and other beings.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.690 align:middle line:10%
So my journey continues.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:18.210 align:middle line:10%
This is not the last you have
heard from me-- or from them.
