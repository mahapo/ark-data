>> Mel Gibson's arrest for
driving under the influence was

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:57.848 align:middle line:84%
followed by an abusive
verbal outburst.

--made fun of Irish,
Jews, Italians,

>> All of the drugs in
in the victims' body,

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:14.155 align:middle line:84%
which were discovered in
nearby prescription bottles,

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:84%
were legally obtained
from two physicians.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.105 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really bizarre to me
when someone does something

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:22.075 align:middle line:90%
so stupid.

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:23.065 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>> 25 years ago, I woke
up on a cold marble floor,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:10%
and I had passed
out after a night--

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:10%
I should say another night--

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:10%
of drugs.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But something had
shifted, and I knew

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that if I didn't make a
dramatic change in my life

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
that I was going to die.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
And I called my
mother, and I said,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I need to go back
into treatment.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'd already been in
treatment three or four times.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:90%
All these other times, I left.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
On day 10, I started
to feel great.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm drug-free.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not like any
of these people.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would pack
up my little bag,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
put my little arrogant suit
on, and march myself out

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of treatment, and I was free.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I was going to make
it to the other side.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
By day 6 or 7, I'd be on the
phone, looking for my drugs,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and end up right back in rehab.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So instead of running away this
time, I went into the bathroom,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and I got down on
my hands and knees.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I started begging, please
relieve me of this pain.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I cannot change my
desire to leave.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
on that floor,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:90%
something happened to me.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Something that was like magic.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:90%
It was mind-blowing to me.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the sudden,
after a few minutes,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I knew I could
stay one more day.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
How could I go from
terrified and my mind going

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
a million miles a minute to
this place of complete peace?

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of there
on day 28, knowing

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
that I had to find out about.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> The shadow is dark.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:90%
It's secretive.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It can be dangerous.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The shadow is everything
that we don't want other people

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:90%
to see.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Things we hide,
things that we lie about.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Not only to us,
but to ourselves.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And they are the sort
of monsters that come out

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
of the caves in the
middle of the night.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It is that dark, intrinsic
side of us that each and every

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:90%
one of us tries to hide.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we've been told from
such an early age that these

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
are not acceptable
components of who we are.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> To have one
aspect of the soul,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.675 align:middle line:84%
you have to experience the
other aspect of the soul

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:90%
to counterbalance it.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> "Hello darkness,
my old friend.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I've come to talk to you again."

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
They we're talking
about the shadow.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The only time you don't have
a shadow is if you're standing

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
in the darkness.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The shadow shows
up in so many ways.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Writing bad checks,
drinking too much,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
cheating on our tax
returns, dipping

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
into our expense account
or the family trust,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:84%
eating chocolate cake in
the middle of the night

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
after three days of dieting,
and depriving ourselves.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Screaming at our kids or
verbally abusing our partners

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
after being the nice guy at work
all day, surfing the internet

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and visiting porn sites while
our wife makes us dinner.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:10%
Cheating on our husband
while he is hard at work,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:10%
trying to provide all
the extra pleasures

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:10%
in life for our family.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Stealing our coworkers' ideas
and claiming them as our own.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
The shadow is made up of
the thoughts, emotions,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and impulses that we find
too painful, embarrassing,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:90%
or distasteful to accept.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So instead of dealing with
them, we repress them.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Right now, hundreds
of millions of people

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
are living in denial of
their individual shadow,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and all of us are being affected
by the collective shadow

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:84%
in more ways than
we can imagine.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The collective shadow
manifests as evil, as war,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
as terrorism, as
social injustice,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
as radical inequities
in our economic status.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:10%
You know, right now, we
have 50% of the world living

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:10%
on less than $2 a day,
20% of the world living

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:10%
on less than $1 a day.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We are totally in
denial of the fact

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that this is also
a manifestation

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:90%
of our collective shadow.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Because people in
social institutions

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and financial institutions,
political institutions,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
corporate institutions
are in total denial

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:90%
of the shadow energy.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:90%
They don't even understand it.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean what we
call evil in the world

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is the manifestation of our
collective shadow, turned

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
pathological.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Repressed, in rage, in denial.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
People who express
self-righteous morality

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
are usually the ones who have
the darkest, deepest shadows.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:10%
The shadow of the
Catholic church,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:10%
which pronounces on
homosexuality as evil and calls

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:10%
gays sinners while hiding
pedophiles in its own clergy.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
These are all expressions
of the shadow.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The entire trajectory of
human history at this point is

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:90%
like the "Titanic."

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:90%
It is headed for an iceberg.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.622 align:middle line:84%
It is going in a direction
that is unsustainable,

00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and it is going in
a direction that

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is unsurvivable if
not for us, then

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
at least for our children
or our grandchildren.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And from an archetypal
perspective,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:84%
each and every one
of us is the captain.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And the temptation
is, it's too painful.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.756 align:middle line:84%
The temptation is to
just distract ourselves.

00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:22.755 align:middle line:84%
The temptation is to
pretend it's not happening,

00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
or the temptation is
to go into cynicism,

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
or the temptation is
to just go into anger

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and indulge that
and not do anything.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one of us
are challenged at this point.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Don't be the captain who
just goes downstairs and goes

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:90%
to sleep.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that expands
has got to contract.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.133 align:middle line:90%
What goes up's got to come down.

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
People are going to be
confronted with their shadow

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:90%
all of the sudden.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Have been living high,
living wonderful,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
everything's been
exorbitantly exuding.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And now suddenly, there's going
to be a contractive phase.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't
met yourself, if you

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
haven't done your self work, if
you haven't been on the inside

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and done some exploration
and cleaned up--

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, cleaned your
house and detoxed it,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be in trouble.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The birth of our shadow
occurs when we are very young,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
before our logical thinking mind
has developed enough to filter

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
the messages we receive
from parents, caregivers,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:90%
and the world at large.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Even if we had the
best of parents,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
we inevitably got shamed for
displaying certain qualities

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and received the message
that something about us

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
was not OK, that something
was wrong with us,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
or that we were bad.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You greedy little toot.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to eat
all those before dinner?

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> These messages getting
ingrained in our subconscious

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
like a computer virus, altering
our perception of ourselves,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and wounding our
healthy sense of ego.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
When we suppress any
of these qualities,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
we are living in denial
of all of who we are.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.751 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, it's different
based upon our environment.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're raised in a family
of blue collar workers

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and you declare that you
want to play the piano

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
or you want to become an
artist, that artistic quality

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
will be negatively
received, and you may end up

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:90%
having to suppress that.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you're raised

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
in a family of artists
and intellectuals

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and you declare that you want
to start working on construction

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
or you want to be
really athletic,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.161 align:middle line:84%
that may also be
perceived of as negative.

00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We try with all our might
to pretend that we are not that

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:90%
which we hate.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, proving this
is an all-important task

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
for the wounded ego, a
task which the ego believes

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:90%
is vital to its existence.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The wounded ego must
hide all that we

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
believe is unacceptable
about ourselves.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
To accomplish this task,
it constructs a mask

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to prove to others that we are
not as defective, inferior,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
worthless, and bad as
we might fear we are.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:10%
None of us likes to admit
that we have these flaws

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:10%
and insecurities,
so to hide them,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:10%
we create a persona
at a very young age.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:10%
We start to wrap ourselves
up in a new package

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:10%
that we believe will bring
us the love, attention,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.745 align:middle line:10%
and acceptance
that we hunger for.

00:10:26.745 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
We create personas so
that we can belong.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have a public
life and a secret life.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We work hard to feel
good about ourselves,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and a moment later,
we do something

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.245 align:middle line:90%
to sabotage those good feelings.

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
We wear masks that we
believe will take us

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.285 align:middle line:84%
where we want to go, and
these masks take many forms.

00:11:56.285 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Which one do you wear?

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Our masks become our prison.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Beneath the mask that
we show the world,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:90%
our wounded egos are in pain.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
The parts of us that were
deemed bad and wrong by others

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and now by ourselves
are literally

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
screaming to get
out, to be set free,

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and to be accepted and loved as
a valuable part of who we are.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
When we deny ourselves
a safe outlet

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
to express our dark
side, it builds up

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a
powerful force that

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
is capable of
destroying our lives

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:90%
as well as the lives of others.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:10%
This is what I call
the beach ball effect.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:10%
So everything that
we reject, we have

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:10%
to keep beneath
our consciousness.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:90%
We try to bury it, so to speak.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You know how much
energy it takes

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:90%
to put a beach ball underwater?

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
You take your selfish self,
you take your angry self,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:84%
you take your too good self,
your not good enough self,

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:90%
you take all of it.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you have 40 beach
balls you're trying to manage.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens when
you're holding that beach ball

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:90%
underwater?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
When you're young, you've
got lots of energy,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
so you can manage a
lot of beach balls.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But then when you're not in
the midst of possibility,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
when your defenses are down,
when you have your attention

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
on some big prize you're going
to win, all of a sudden, boom!

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Somebody does something.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
What happens to the beach ball?

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Pops up and it hits
you in the face.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:90%
What's road rage?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it anything more than
that each ball coming up?

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
We see it in the
media all the time.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
A filmmaker is making
deep Christian films.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden gets drunk,
shouts anti-Semitic comments

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in a drunken rage, right?

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:84%
A radio star makes his living
being a great communicator.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, makes a
comment, a racial slur.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So all of these beach balls
that you are trying to manage,

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:90%
are you successful at it?

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all, but not anymore.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When you don't deal with the
shadow, that part comes out,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:90%
and it'll creep up.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It'll creep up in workplaces.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It can creep up
in relationships.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we try to suppress
those societally determined

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
undesirable qualities, the
more they find interesting,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
often mischievous ways
to express themselves.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And it would be like locking
somebody in the basement who

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
wants to get out.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So they do things
down there to get

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
our attention until we
recognize them and let them out.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Because those aspects of
ourselves that we don't like

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
exit through a kind
of detox process.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It's got to come out in
order to be released.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my beach balls
happened in front of a room

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
full of people.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm out of
treatment five years.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been floating
around, trying to become

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:90%
the most perfect person.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
How could I have people
want to be my friend?

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
How could I be a
little more spiritual?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I was on a quest,
and I thought I was

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:90%
doing a really beautiful job.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:90%
And I went to another workshop.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
We had to get up in
front of the room

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and say what we were
committed to in the world.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
just being wonderful,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was looking at me
like, you're all looking at me.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And from the back of the
room this woman screams out,

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:90%
you're a bitch!

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, I know that.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:90%
How does she know?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was horrified.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:90%
I was so humiliated.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:84%
It was the one word that I
didn't want to be called.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
tell me something good

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.145 align:middle line:90%
about being a bitch.

00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there's
nothing good.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.811 align:middle line:90%
She goes, well, you're a bitch.

00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be something
good about being a bitch.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And all I could think of was all
the ways that that part of me

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:90%
had hurt me.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
I was a retailer.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do you ever
get damaged merchandise

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:90%
delivered to your store?

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, all the time.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
She said, is there ever a
time where they don't want

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:90%
to take back the damaged goods?

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
do you ever have

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:84%
to get a little forceful
or a little bitchy?

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh my god, yes.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was remodeling
a house at the time.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
She said, when you're
a couple of weeks late

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and $20,000 over budget, does
it help to be a little bitchy?

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Would it help you?

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
realized that when I finally

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
said to the contractor, you
need to finish my house,

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:90%
he finished my house.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And this light went
on inside of me

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that this part of me
that I had shamed,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that I had hated so much,
actually came bearing gifts.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, either
you're going to use it,

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
or it's going to use you.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
life-changing moment for me.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When we fully
understand the human soul,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
we find that it's a place of
ambiguity, of contradiction,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:90%
of paradox.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
All experience is a result of
contrast, light and shadow,

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
pleasure and pain, up and
down, backwards and forwards.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
In order to have manifestation,
you need opposing energies.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
You need your enemies
to be who you are.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
The human soul is simultaneously
divine and diabolical,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
sacred and profane,
a sinner and saint.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Eastern wisdom traditions,
we have a saying.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
The sinner and saint are
merely exchanging notes.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand that,
then first thing you realize

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.725 align:middle line:90%
is to have a shadow is normal.

00:18:38.725 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
If you had only truth,
goodness, harmony on your side

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and the complete
absence of the other,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
creative impulse.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're only the
evolutionary creative impulse

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Then the universe would
rapidly burn itself

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
into the heat death
of absolute zero.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other
hand, you're only

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
the impulse of inertia or
destruction or entropy,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
then the universe would rapidly
collapse into a big black hole

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
before you could
say Deepak Chopra.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We are the microcosm
of the macrocosm.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
This means that every quality
that we can see in another

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:90%
exists within us.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
We possess every human
characteristic and emotion,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
whether active or
dormant, whether

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:90%
conscious or unconscious.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing we can see or
conceive of that we are not.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
We are everything, that
which we consider good

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and that which we consider bad.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
How could we know courage
if we have never known fear?

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
How could we know happiness
if we never knew sadness?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
How could we know the light
if we didn't know dark?

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.790 align:middle line:84%
All of life is based
on the coexistence

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:90%
of these pairs of opposites.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Our shadow is forever
hiding from itself.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Rather than confront
our own darkness,

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
we project these unwanted
qualities onto others.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:10%
When we are projecting
our shadow selves,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:10%
it sounds like this.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:10%
She's so self-centered.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:10%
He's so full of himself.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
These people are idiots.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
What a loser.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Afraid of our own unworthiness
and simultaneously afraid

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of our own greatness,
we unconsciously

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
transfer these
qualities onto another

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
rather than owning
them ourselves.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Those we project on own pieces
of our unclaimed darkness

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as pieces of
our unclaimed light.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Until we take back all that
we have projected away,

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:84%
what we can't be
with won't let us be.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the most frequently
asked questions I get

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you know
if you're projecting?

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:90%
If it's your stuff or theirs?

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it was best said
by revered philosopher

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and psychologist Ken Wilber.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:84%
He says that if a person or
a thing in our environment

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:84%
informs us, if we receive what
is happening as information,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
a point of interest, we
probably aren't projecting.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if it affects us--

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
we're pointing our fingers,
judging, if we're plugged in--

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
chances are that we are a
victim of our own projections.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Think of someone from your
own life who disgusts, annoys,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
or repulses you, and think
of the qualities about them

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that you most hate.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine this person
standing right in front of you.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to put your hand
out, point your finger at them,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and say, you're an idiot,
or you're are a know-it-all,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
or you're selfish.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Now stop where you are.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Keep your finger
pointing at them,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and now notice that one finger
is pointing at them, and where

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
the other three
fingers pointing?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Back at you.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the phenomenon
of projection.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Instead of acknowledging
the qualities within us

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that we dislike, we project
them onto someone else.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We project them onto our
mothers, our kids, our friends,

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:84%
or even better, some
famous public figure

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:90%
who we have never even met.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
If I asked each of you what
you love about these people,

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
you would each have
a different response.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
The people that you hate
also represent some aspect

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:90%
of yourself that you don't own.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Notice what you
think and feel as you

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.009 align:middle line:90%
look at each of these people.

00:22:51.009 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we judge or
condemn in another

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:54.113 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately a disowned or
rejected part of ourselves.

00:23:54.113 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I was watching the events
of 9/11 on TV with a friend

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:90%
of mine.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we were
driving down the street,

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and turned to my friend and I
said, you know, from now on,

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:84%
the Arabs are going
to be the new blacks.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get the
brunt of a lot of projections

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that blacks have carried in
this culture for a long time.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of times,
blacks react.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
We react to those projections,
and we project back,

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and that creates
a vicious cycle.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And the ego consciousness
just responds the way

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
it should, really, because
it's designed to respond

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:90%
as a survival mechanism.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what the ego's all
about, to help us survive.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's mechanical.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:90%
It's reactive.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
When an aggressive, negative
energy is directed at us,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the ego immediately wants
to defend and react.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when you
react to a projection,

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:90%
you become that projection.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
become an angry black man.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
I don't get angry.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I certainly can
and do get angry,

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
but I express it and let it go.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an old Sufi story
about a philosopher who made

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:84%
an appointment to debate with
a Sufi wisdom teacher named

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Nasrudin.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
When the philosopher
arrived at his appointment,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:84%
he found Nasrudin
away from his home.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Infuriated, the philosopher
picked up a piece of chalk

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and wrote stupid oaf
on Nasrudin's gate.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:84%
When Nasrudin got
home and saw this,

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
he rushed right over to
the philosopher's house.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I had forgotten that
you were to call,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sorry I missed
your appointment, he said.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But I remembered it the
minute I saw that you had

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:90%
written your name on my gate.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
The great Swiss
psychologist Carl Jung

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:84%
who coined the word
shadow and shadow

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
work said that is the shadow,
the person we'd rather not be.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Rush Limbaugh
hated drug addicts,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and then it was revealed
that he was one himself.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Reverend Ted Haggard
railed against homosexuals,

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:10%
and was later caught in a drug
and male prostitute scandal.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
A powerful example
of projection at play

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
is that of the ex-governor
of New York, Eliot Spitzer.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:84%
As a public official,
Spitzer worked tirelessly

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:84%
to rid the streets of
prostitution rings.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, he wound
up getting busted

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
for having a
relationship with a call

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
girl, which ruined
his reputation

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and his political future.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
If we look at this through
the eyes of the shadow,

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that some
time long ago, probably

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
as a young man, he had the
impulse to sleep with a hooker.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Since this wasn't politically
or socially acceptable,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:84%
he buried this
impulse deep inside,

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
only to be brought down by
this very unconscious urge.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating to
see that he tried

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the temptation
in the outer world

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.690 align:middle line:84%
because unconsciously, he knew
that the real danger lurked

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
in his inner world.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.159 align:middle line:84%
This is why we want to
deal with the shadow.

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying
to convince you

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
that you're not all
those negative things

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging you to
think a good thought,

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
shadow work urges
you to get in there

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and to be with what you
are resisting, because what

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:90%
you resist will persist.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't deal with your
shadow, it will deal with you.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The cost of ignoring a
destructive pattern is that

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:90%
you're going to self-destruct.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You will implode
rather than explode.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.625 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, my training
is as a neurologist,

00:28:07.625 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
so I've spent well over
three decades studying how

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system
organizes this information.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
quite interesting

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the
fact that really,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
even though we think of
having one brain, we actually

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:90%
have three different brains.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
We have this very
primitive brain,

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
which some people call
the reptilian brain.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at a reptile
or look at a crocodile,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:84%
it really just has two
responses, on or off.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever watched
a crocodile try and eat

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:84%
a wildebeest, it seems
to be very quiet,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.360 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly explodes.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes back
into its quiet state.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So that response is really a
very basic survival response.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But the mammalian brain,
which is sometimes

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:84%
known as the limbic brain, has
created a modulating effect

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:90%
on that reptilian brain.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So the limbic system has
brought into this very primitive

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
on/off response
gradations, meaning

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:84%
you can be a little bit on,
significantly on, really on.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But then on top of that
mammalian brain, really

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:84%
just for the last
couple 100,000 years,

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:84%
we've evolved this human brain,
which is called the neocortex,

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:84%
neo meaning new cortex,
new covering of the brain.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And that actually allows
us, for the first time

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
in evolutionary history,
to decide whether or not

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:90%
we want to react at all.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If we look at brain
scans, we can actually see

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:84%
in a traumatized brain this part
of the brain kind of shutting

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:90%
down, becoming dark.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:84%
The part of the brain that
is associated with emotions

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is that part you might
be familiar with,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:84%
the fight or flight
or freeze response.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:84%
The amygdala, which
is the fear processing

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:84%
center in this part of the
brain, really becomes bright.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is trauma
changes brain functioning,

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and then that triggers changes
in stress hormones in the body,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:90%
which are not a good thing.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's crucial to be able to
recognize and express any kind

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:90%
of pain.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Without that, it stays with us.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:90%
It lodges in the body.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And it causes us to react,
to live unconsciously.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The unresolved issues that
people have in their bodies,

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:84%
their emotions, has an absolute
direct correlation with

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.440 align:middle line:84%
their physical bodies, their
health, and their well-being,

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.085 align:middle line:84%
their expression of
wellness overall.

00:30:17.085 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
They think that their
health is somehow

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:90%
separate from their emotions.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:90%
They are intimately connected.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Obesity, diabetes,
heart disease, and cancer.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
They're all the
result significantly

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
of chronic, unprocessed,
inflammatory molecules

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that have their correlates
in the psychologic world

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:84%
of chronic, unprocessed
emotions and experiences.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Every single one of those
conditions is a byproduct

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.660 align:middle line:90%
of our stress levels.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It affects our
health intimately.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Most people are aware
that what they eat

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and what they drink affect
their toxicity levels.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
What they don't realize
is that what they think

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions that
they've built up over years

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.910 align:middle line:90%
are really the most toxic.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The ways that people have
dealt with this traditionally

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:90%
and historically are inadequate.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.434 align:middle line:90%
My patients are in overwhelm.

00:31:04.434 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:90%
This is not new age mumbo jumbo.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:90%
This is actually hard science.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The science here now is
indisputable that thoughts,

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that emotions affect
the organs of the body.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to be mindful with
every single thought that we

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:90%
have every single day.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:84%
How do we want to create
our heaven or our hell?

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.670 align:middle line:90%
How do we treat one another?

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we are the source
of everything within us.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a poem by Rumi
called "The Guest House,"

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.360 align:middle line:84%
which in many ways
describes the human journey.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> "This being human
is a guest house.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Every morning, a new arrival.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.490 align:middle line:84%
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.520 align:middle line:90%
comes as an unexpected visitor.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Welcome and entertain
them all, even

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
if they are a crowd of sorrows
who violently sweep your house

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:90%
empty of its furniture.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Still treat each
guest honorably.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
He may be clearing you
out for some new delight.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The dark thought, the
shade, the malice,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:84%
meet them at the door
laughing, and invite them in.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Be grateful for whoever
comes, because each has been

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:90%
sent as a guide from beyond."

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Repressing our anger may
seem like a good solution,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:84%
but pretty soon, we run
out of places to hide.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Divorce, stress at work,
financial trouble, or tension

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:84%
within our families
provoke the shadow

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:90%
until finally, it erupts.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.670 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Vedic text
known as the Bhagavad Gita

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:07.730 align:middle line:84%
states that man should
discover his own reality,

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:84%
not thwart himself, for he
has himself as his only friend

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.830 align:middle line:90%
or as his only enemy.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But if he rejects
his own reality,

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:90%
the self will war against him.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to love
yourself when you wake up

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
feeling strong and worthy,
and you have enough money

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:90%
in the bank and you feel great.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But how do you love yourself
when you feel broke,

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:84%
or when you've been
hurt or abused?

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And that sets up the
conflict which, as we get older,

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
those wonderful forces that
we've locked up in our shadow

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:90%
are rattling the cages.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes if we're
distracted, they sneak out

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and we think and
the people around us

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:90%
think, what were we thinking?

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
we weren't thinking.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.914 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're pressed, the
shadow can look like this.

00:34:01.914 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:90%


00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We have to resolve the
undigested emotions that

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.160 align:middle line:84%
are buried in our bodies and
lodged as stress in our minds.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to unearth,
own, and embrace

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:30.240 align:middle line:84%
the very parts of ourselves that
have caused us the most pain.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we do, the
light of our awareness

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:84%
will begin the process
of transforming them.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:90%
We think we're alone.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.390 align:middle line:90%
We think we're different.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:90%
We feel isolated or abandoned.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
come together, we

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.090 align:middle line:84%
find out that we all
go through traumas,

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:84%
that to be human is
to be challenged,

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and that everyone has
gone through some trauma.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And if we're courageous,
we see that there

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is gold to be mined
in every experience.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:09.247 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.247 --> 00:36:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very interesting,
because I don't remember

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.270 align:middle line:84%
a single day where my mother
was not drunk, you know?

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.055 align:middle line:90%
And I had to live through this.

00:36:16.055 --> 00:36:17.750 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't understand it.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Very, very confused by it all.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Because as she would drink and
as she became into that space,

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew I didn't know her, and
I just wished she was dead.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.965 align:middle line:90%
I said, I wish you were dead.

00:36:29.965 --> 00:36:30.949 align:middle line:90%
I wish you were dead.

00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the pain out of
my life, out of my life.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Because you don't belong here.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you are, this
intoxicated person, and as

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
a child looking at this, because
my father wasn't there either,

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:90%
I had to figure this out.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But all I did was
wish she was dead.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, not till 30, 40 years
later after she had passed

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:84%
over-- she was many,
many years after that--

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and after getting
involved in this work,

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
that was indeed one

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of the most incredible
blessings of my life.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I learned from that
situation about compassion,

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.121 align:middle line:90%
and I learned about forgiveness.

00:37:05.121 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pretty
big one, to have

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.230 align:middle line:90%
to learn about forgiveness.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, we see these things
as horrific experiences,

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.870 align:middle line:84%
terrible experiences,
dark experiences, when

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
in truth, they're really
enlightened experiences,

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:84%
because they help
us to be who we are.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:84%
They help us to
be compassionate.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:90%
They help us to be forgiving.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.692 align:middle line:84%
They help us to look at
someone very, very differently.

00:37:26.692 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.455 align:middle line:84%
>> What doesn't kill
us makes us stronger.

00:37:31.455 --> 00:37:35.229 align:middle line:90%


00:37:35.229 --> 00:37:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> At a certain point in
life, it's about saying,

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.061 align:middle line:84%
I have been through
what I've been through.

00:37:39.061 --> 00:37:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I've succeeded in
some ways, perhaps,

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:84%
but I've also
failed in some ways.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been strong at times, but
I've also been weak at times.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten some things
right, and other things,

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.947 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten wrong.

00:37:48.947 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And some things have
gone well for me,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.392 align:middle line:84%
and some things have
been damn awful.

00:37:53.392 --> 00:37:55.600 align:middle line:84%
The issue is, what am I
going to do with all of that?

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.058 align:middle line:84%
You know, two people
can go through

00:37:57.058 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:84%
the exact same situation
on a external level,

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.200 align:middle line:84%
but internally, they do two
completely different things

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.599 align:middle line:84%
That's why we read
incredible stories

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:84%
about people who went
through the Holocaust

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.180 align:middle line:84%
or people who were
victims of genocide,

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and yet they survived.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they go on to
live extraordinary lives.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.926 align:middle line:84%
And then you meet
other people who

00:38:14.926 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:84%
went through a fraction of that
in terms of an internal trauma,

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
but they stay stuck
in it forever.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:84%
We begin to ask ourselves,
what am I getting

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:90%
from staying stuck there?

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
What am I avoiding from
staying stuck there?

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we are avoiding is
the greatest challenge of all,

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and that is to be who we can
be in order to serve the world.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked a few people to
share their own shadow stories.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are complete,
others are ongoing.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
All of them are portraits
of a fearless commitment

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:45.460 align:middle line:90%
to transformation.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Swee is like that beautiful
combination of a miracle.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:84%
That part of her that she deems
so worthless and unlovable

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
actually comes bearing
the greatest gifts

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and makes her the shining
light that she is today.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The pain that I've been
carrying throughout my life was

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:84%
the pain of believing that I
was abandoned by my parents

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:90%
because I wasn't pure enough.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually mixed in terms of
half-Japanese, half-Chinese.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I was considered mixed
and impure enough

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:90%
to be raised in Japan.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, my parents
live in Japan,

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and they left me with my
grandparents in Malaysia.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I just felt so
abandoned and rejected.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:84%
My father ended up getting
a divorce from my mother.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
He remarried a Japanese
woman, but nobody ever

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:84%
told me that when my father
came back with his wife

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:90%
that she's not my mother.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.865 align:middle line:84%
I felt the immediate rejection
that they didn't want me

00:39:55.865 --> 00:39:57.970 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, and
that they would rather

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:02.940 align:middle line:84%
have two dogs than
have me with them.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I have always discarded
my Japanese identity in

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.960 align:middle line:84%
favor of my Malaysian
Chinese identity.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I felt like the country
has betrayed me,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and I used that pain to
really put it into my work.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I heard a project was
in trouble in Japan,

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and I volunteered to go to
Japan to fix this problem,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.690 align:middle line:84%
because I know
that I could do it.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.710 align:middle line:84%
That one day I
stepped into Tokyo

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt
that, this is where

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I need to be to really
discover and explore

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.230 align:middle line:90%
the Japanese half of me.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
In less than three years,
I create a business

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:84%
from $40 million to
over $200 million

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:90%
in a country dominated by men.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, never heard of a
half-Japanese, half-Chinese

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:84%
woman being a business leader
in a big US telecom world.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't be the
leader I am today

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
without going
through the emotions,

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and the pain that I went
through my whole life.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.165 align:middle line:84%
>> If we look deeper, we will
see that we all have a divine

00:41:10.165 --> 00:41:10.965 align:middle line:90%
recipe.

00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.690 align:middle line:84%
All of us have
shame about things

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that have happened to us.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We've all gone through
difficult times.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We address these issues
so we can quiet our minds,

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
heal our bodies, and get
closer to our hearts' desires.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Hector had to let go
of his macho persona

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to make peace with
the one that he loved

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.594 align:middle line:90%
the most, which was his father.

00:42:15.594 --> 00:42:18.250 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> My father was your
traditional Mexican man

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.040 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of working
hard, wanting to get ahead,

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:84%
wanting to provide
for his family.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And as a young boy, I
was looking for his love.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I wanted his attention.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
The challenge was
trying to figure out

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:90%
what was wrong with me.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
something's wrong with me

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:84%
if, number one, he's not
giving me the attention

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I want as a little boy,
not giving me the love.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Yelling at me, you know,
being verbally abusive.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I did
something wrong.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.463 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong with me.

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So I carried that story from
that point on for a long time.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And I realized he
probably wasn't going

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:90%
to do it the way I wanted.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.250 align:middle line:84%
He probably wasn't
going to tell me

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.720 align:middle line:84%
what I wanted when
I was a little boy.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Mi te quiero, [SPANISH],,
I love you, son.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:09.890 align:middle line:90%
I did some personal growth work.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.747 align:middle line:84%
I went inside, looked at the
shame, the guilt, the pain.

00:43:12.747 --> 00:43:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I went through that.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I healed that.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to have that
forgiveness with my dad,

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:90%
and let that go.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to tell
him I love you for him.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I was going to tell
him I love you for me.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:84%
My dad passed on, and I'm
really grateful that I listened

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.666 align:middle line:84%
to that inner voice that said,
you know, go ahead and tell

00:43:38.666 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:90%
your dad that you love him.

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Do it for yourself.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Edie Eger is one
of the most beautiful,

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:84%
divine women on
the planet today.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And she survived the
worst circumstances,

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
something that most of us
can't even ever imagine.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> May 22, 1944.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.090 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived in
Auschwitz, there was chaos.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.440 align:middle line:90%
My father was separated from us.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And my sister and I
facing Dr. Mengele.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who
he was until later.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed to my mom to
go to the left, and my sister

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and I to the right.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I asked an inmate, when
will I see my mother?

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And she pointed at the
chimney, and the fire

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.820 align:middle line:90%
was coming out of the chimney.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you better
talk about your mother

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.120 align:middle line:90%
in past tense.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.580 align:middle line:90%
She's burning there.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
My sister and I held
each other and said,

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.220 align:middle line:90%
the spirit never dies.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.160 align:middle line:90%
The spirit never dies.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember that so
vividly even today.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:84%
In Auschwitz, we
didn't know when

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we took a shower whether water
is going to come out or gas.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there were others
who ran into the barbed wires.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:90%
They got electrocuted.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that night, Dr. Mengele
came to the barracks

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.120 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to be entertained.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And my friends knew that I
was a very talented gymnast,

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and so they volunteered
me, and I ended up

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:90%
dancing for Dr. Mengele.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes, and the
music was Tchaikovsky.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was dancing in Budapest
to "Romeo and Juliet."

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:90%
I completely dissociated.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And we had choices.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.950 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I chose to look at the guards
that they were more in prison

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.120 align:middle line:90%
than I was.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember they took my
blood about twice a week.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, why are
you taking my blood?

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.535 align:middle line:84%
And the man said,
I'm taking your blood

00:45:56.535 --> 00:46:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to aid the German soldiers
so we can win the war.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I said to my myself,
I was a pacifist.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I was [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I bet with my blood, you're
never going to win the war.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So I created the
part in me that I

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
was able to still
be in charge of,

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and not allowing anything
that happened externally

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to murder my spirit.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember I said,
if I survive today,

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.180 align:middle line:90%
then tomorrow, I'll be free.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember when Marita
came to the shadow process,

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was looking for
the negative qualities they

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.330 align:middle line:90%
needed to embrace.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Marita couldn't even say
hers, and I kept asking,

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.710 align:middle line:84%
what is so horrible that
you can't even say it?

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because
of my background,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.660 align:middle line:90%
mine is that I'm a Nazi.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I was born in Germany in
1955, 10 years after the war.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I found out when I was 11 or
12 what my country had done.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject we
never talked about.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather wouldn't tell
me about his experience.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.170 align:middle line:84%
My mother wants nothing
to do with this.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only German
that holds this and lives

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.500 align:middle line:90%
this and hides this.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I found many ways
to sabotage myself

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.120 align:middle line:84%
from ever tasting
power or success,

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.000 align:middle line:84%
because Hitler was successful
to come into power,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and that power was
horribly abused.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't interact with
any Germans at all.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I stayed away from them.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And I did not want to interact
with any Jewish person,

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.025 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want
to cause any more pain,

00:47:50.025 --> 00:47:51.144 align:middle line:90%
and I was ashamed.

00:47:51.144 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Samia was willing to
shine light on the darkness

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and willing to take back her own
projections for the good of all

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.640 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2006, when Israel
bombed Lebanon, at the time,

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to evacuate members
of my family and try to bring

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:13.952 align:middle line:90%
them over to the US.

00:48:13.952 --> 00:48:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And there were no news.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You've got-- you
needed to figure out

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.940 align:middle line:90%
how to reach to them.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I became so angry
again, because here

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:90%
is my family in the bombing.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.400 align:middle line:90%
One day I was watching TV.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw girls crying,
little girls.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.042 align:middle line:90%
I saw they were Lebanese girls.

00:48:27.042 --> 00:48:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
know, every time

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I saw Lebanese kids being
bombed and everything,

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.910 align:middle line:90%
I was really, really angry.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you
know, yes, yes, yes.

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's bomb the
bastards kind of thing.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And at the end, I realized
they were reporting

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:46.920 align:middle line:10%
from the Israeli border, on
the other side of the border,

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.850 align:middle line:10%
and they looked exactly the
same as the Lebanese girls that

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:57.090 align:middle line:10%
were killed on the other side of
the border, and I saw the pain.

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And that day, that day I
made a commitment to myself

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:84%
that I will no longer
tolerate that kind of cruelty,

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:11.070 align:middle line:84%
irrespective of which side
of the border it's happening.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I'm not saying that if
you and I rise up to become

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.560 align:middle line:84%
the people that we are capable
of being that we will rid this

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.370 align:middle line:90%
planet of war in our lifetime.

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But I believe with
all my heart, we

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.630 align:middle line:84%
will achieve enough
this lifetime

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.120 align:middle line:84%
that humanity will
go in that direction.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's embracing
authentically who you are,

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and not being ashamed of it.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.860 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
to be ashamed of,

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:90%
because everybody has a shadow.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.530 align:middle line:84%
If somebody doesn't, they
must be pathological.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:90%


00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When I'm leading
the shadow process,

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.825 align:middle line:84%
it feels like my own journey
has come full circle.

00:49:48.825 --> 00:49:51.285 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been very
judgmental over the years.

00:49:51.285 --> 00:49:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I was having some really dark
dreams about you last night.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.352 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all true.

00:49:58.352 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> When we embrace our
totality, we experience freedom.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> My heart feels
as big as my body.

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer,
like, little anymore.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like, it's me.

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And embrace it with love.

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what we're here
for, to give and receive love.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Can't even believe
that you, Margaret.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.445 align:middle line:90%
I figured out who you were.

00:50:21.445 --> 00:50:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I-- I remember.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.887 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't faced
my darkness, I never

00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:27.970 align:middle line:90%
would have found my light.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:29.950 align:middle line:84%
(WHISPERING) I can't
let my makeup run.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.415 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:33.415 --> 00:51:01.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Our deepest fear is that we
are powerful beyond measure.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:15.300 align:middle line:84%
It's our light, not our
darkness that most frightens us.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.720 align:middle line:84%
We ask ourselves, who am I to be
brilliant, gorgeous, talented,

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and fabulous?

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But actually, who
are you not to be?

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.380 align:middle line:10%
You are a child of God.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Your playing small
doesn't serve the world.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.100 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing
enlightened about shrinking

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:10%
so that other people won't
feel insecure around you.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:40.540 align:middle line:84%
We are all meant to
shine as children do.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.300 align:middle line:84%
We were born to make manifest
the glory of God that

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.480 align:middle line:90%
is within us.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in some of us.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.960 align:middle line:90%
It's in everyone.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we let our
own light shine,

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we unconsciously
give other people

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.630 align:middle line:90%
permission to do the same.

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:00.010 align:middle line:84%
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.185 align:middle line:84%
our presence automatically
liberates others.

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Consider the story
of the Golden Buddha.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:84%
In 1957, a monastery in
Thailand was being relocated,

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and a group of monks
was put in charge

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.650 align:middle line:90%
of moving a giant clay Buddha.

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.080 align:middle line:84%
In the myths of the
move, one of the monks

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.060 align:middle line:90%
noticed a crack in the Buddha.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Concerned about
damaging the idol,

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:31.630 align:middle line:84%
the monks decided to wait
a day before continuing

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.980 align:middle line:90%
with their task.

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Later on, one of the monks came
to check on the giant statue.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:84%
He shined his flashlight
over the entire Buddha,

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and when he reached
the crack, he

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.740 align:middle line:84%
saw something
reflected back at him.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.230 align:middle line:84%
His curiosity aroused, the
monk got a hammer and a chisel

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and began chipping away
at the clay Buddha.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:56.770 align:middle line:84%
As he knocked off piece
after piece of clay,

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.770 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha got
brighter and brighter.

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:03.790 align:middle line:84%
After hours of work, the
monk looked up in amazement

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:84%
to see standing before him
a huge, solid gold Buddha.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Historians believe the Buddha
had been covered with clay

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
by Thai monks several hundred
years earlier before an attack

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.750 align:middle line:90%
by the Burmese army.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:23.370 align:middle line:84%
They covered the
Buddha to protect it.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.620 align:middle line:84%
In the attack, all
the monks were killed,

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:33.130 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't until 1957 that the
great treasure was discovered.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Like the Buddha, our outer shell
protects us from the world.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Our real treasure
is hidden within.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We human beings unconsciously
hide our inner gold

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.500 align:middle line:90%
under a layer of clay.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.890 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do
to uncover our gold

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.395 align:middle line:84%
is to have the courage to chip
away at our outer shell, piece

00:53:55.395 --> 00:53:56.195 align:middle line:90%
by piece.

00:53:56.195 --> 00:54:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't fight
darkness with darkness,

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.130 align:middle line:90%
but you can switch on the light.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the work we do on
the shadow is to get us to this

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:13.360 align:middle line:90%
point where we can forgive.

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.780 align:middle line:84%
To do forgiveness, we put
blindfolds on to make it safe

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.955 align:middle line:84%
for people to share
their deepest secrets.

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:31.996 align:middle line:90%


00:54:31.996 --> 00:54:33.454 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING)
I forgive myself.

00:54:33.454 --> 00:54:34.450 align:middle line:84%

I forgive myself.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.520 align:middle line:84%

not finishing college.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.510 align:middle line:84%

forgive myself--

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:38.680 align:middle line:90%

>> (WHISPERING)
I forgive myself.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I forgive myself
for hating my body.

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.395 align:middle line:90%
>> For screaming at my kids.

00:54:44.395 --> 00:54:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> For not laughing enough.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Or for thinking that I'm a
stupid, incompetent asshole.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> For stealing
from my first boss.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> For being rich.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> For being beautiful.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> For drinking too much.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Not speaking out.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I forgive myself.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I forgive myself.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The light.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.266 align:middle line:84%
>> For cheating,
binging on my diet.

00:55:02.266 --> 00:55:03.640 align:middle line:84%

I forgive myself.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.390 align:middle line:84%

I forgive myself.

00:55:05.765 --> 00:55:08.016 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING)
I forgive myself.

00:55:08.016 --> 00:55:11.944 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING) I forgive
myself for everything.

00:55:11.944 --> 00:55:14.399 align:middle line:10%
>> (WHISPERING)
You are forgiven.

00:55:14.399 --> 00:55:16.854 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING)
You are forgiven.

00:55:16.854 --> 00:55:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING)
You are forgiven.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.191 align:middle line:84%
>> (WHISPERING) You are
completely forgiven.

00:55:21.191 --> 00:55:28.020 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people are
very afraid of their shadow.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.095 align:middle line:84%
They don't even want to
consider that they have one.

00:55:35.095 --> 00:55:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Brent is one of the
holiest men that I know,

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:44.010 align:middle line:84%
he is so spiritually evolved
because he uses the pain of his

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:48.690 align:middle line:84%
past to be the greatest
expression of himself today.

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> This story really began for
me when I was nine years old,

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was attending a
summer camp that was managed

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:59.520 align:middle line:90%
by an order of religious men.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:05.040 align:middle line:84%
During that summer,
I was molested

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.100 align:middle line:90%
by one of the religious men.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember that experience being
a beginning of a split for me

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.480 align:middle line:90%
from myself.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It happened a number
of other times

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.340 align:middle line:84%
during that period of
time I was at that camp.

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I was always afraid
that that guy

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.210 align:middle line:84%
was going to come in in
the middle of the night.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I even went so far as to
borrow a knife from someone

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.440 align:middle line:90%
that I kept under the pillow.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I was a nine-year-old kid.

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember I just felt like some
part of me died at that time.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I went on with my life,
holding onto that secret,

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:43.170 align:middle line:84%
holding onto that shame
of not really being

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.193 align:middle line:90%
connected with myself anymore.

00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The difference between forgiving
and condoning, forgiving

00:56:55.190 --> 00:57:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is seeing the true
heart of another person.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond all the action.

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.856 align:middle line:84%
In holding anybody to blame,
we limit our own love.

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:18.990 align:middle line:84%
People need to know
that they can get help,

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have to carry
their shame alone, that they

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:26.490 align:middle line:90%
don't have to live in a secret.

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And that there are people that
are holding the light for them,

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that are willing to see them
as they are through the shadow.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
to see yourself

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the light and the
darkness, and to embrace it.

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I use that analogy of being
like a drowning person where

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:53.150 align:middle line:84%
someone's holding
your head underwater.

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
you realize that you

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.580 align:middle line:84%
have to be the one that fights
your way back to the surface.

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.210 align:middle line:84%
What happened to me as
a child has given me

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.320 align:middle line:84%
a real depth of
compassion, which

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful for,
because it's so clear to me

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.670 align:middle line:84%
when I work with
people how they're

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:13.001 align:middle line:90%
suffering, how they're hiding.

00:58:13.001 --> 00:58:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's been the
greatest gift of my life

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that I'm in a
position where I can--

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:19.266 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:58:19.266 --> 00:58:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:24.160 align:middle line:84%
--where I can honor
people in that way.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so grateful to be
able to connect with people

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on that most vulnerable level,
that deepest level of the soul.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I regained my faith
because I asked for it.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Forgiveness doesn't happen
in your head until it happens

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.226 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:58:49.226 --> 00:58:52.400 align:middle line:90%


00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> My mom was walking downtown
Beirut with the young Israelis.

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.207 align:middle line:84%
And she turns to my
dad, and her mother

00:58:59.207 --> 00:59:00.540 align:middle line:90%
had been killed by the Israelis.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.979 align:middle line:84%
She goes, Mustafa, these
are young soldiers.

00:59:02.979 --> 00:59:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Don't they have a mother?

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.540 align:middle line:90%


00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And if she can forgive,
who are we not to forgive?

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you can't move
on if you don't forgive.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The train stops if
you don't forgive.

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, you've got
to forgive yourself

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.720 align:middle line:84%
for taking whatever happened to
you too deep, to a deep place

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.100 align:middle line:90%
that it shut you down.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.305 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe will deal
with that person's karma.

00:59:28.305 --> 00:59:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry
that if you quote, unquote,

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.450 align:middle line:84%
"forgive" them that they're
going to somehow live

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:35.130 align:middle line:90%
an undeserved, wonderful life.

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Each and every one of
us needs to work full time

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.770 align:middle line:90%
on self-forgiveness.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Our motivation to forgive
is increased when we understand

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:45.640 align:middle line:90%
why it's so important.

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to make
their day better.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It's to free you.

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And forgiveness is the
hallway between the past

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and the future.

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The future expression
of who we are as a planet,

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:03.100 align:middle line:84%
as our country and America
depends on the people that grow

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.600 align:middle line:84%
up, that become the
next presidents,

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.487 align:middle line:84%
that become the next
politicians, economists.

01:00:07.487 --> 01:00:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We want to make a difference.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.780 align:middle line:84%
We want to somehow get
it right, you know?

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.270 align:middle line:84%
To feel like we
did or at least we

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:17.300 align:middle line:84%
tried to do what
we came here to do.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.509 align:middle line:84%
That is the gold that
a being mined today.

01:00:19.509 --> 01:00:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's because
the world is growing.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.742 align:middle line:90%
We are entering a new age.

01:00:22.742 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.199 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
talking about this.

01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> You are a force of love.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.970 align:middle line:90%
You are made from love.

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And love is the most forceful
energy you could ever have.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Accept that energy.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Accept who you are.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Accept your inheritance,
if you will.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You're the total
being of love,

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.380 align:middle line:90%
and don't waste a minute of it.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I've come full circle.

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the external of
what was going on inside of me.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's how we are able to
perceive everything in life

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:53.088 align:middle line:90%
as an opportunity for growth.

01:00:53.088 --> 01:01:02.052 align:middle line:90%


01:01:02.052 --> 01:01:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I got married.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I have three children
and five grandchildren,

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.530 align:middle line:90%
and one great grandson.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:10.837 align:middle line:84%
And that's the best
revenge to Hitler.

01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:13.272 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:01:13.272 --> 01:01:15.068 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:15.068 --> 01:01:16.044 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:01:16.044 --> 01:01:27.268 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:31.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So if you want authentic
peace of mind, creativity,

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:36.580 align:middle line:10%
kindness, compassion, joy,
then you've got to understand

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.665 align:middle line:10%
your shadow and be OK with it.

01:01:38.665 --> 01:01:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Celebrate it.

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If shadows could talk,
they would tell us that

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we're as precious as a
million pounds of gold,

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that our brightest light can
shine only when we've accepted

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
our darkness, that there
is wisdom in every wound,

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that there is a greater
future waiting for us,

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that we are children of God
and have a right to be here,

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that we were all created equal,
that our pain is not personal,

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
but belongs to every
man and woman alive.

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And life is a magical journey
of making peace with both

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.270 align:middle line:90%
our humanity and divinity.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
They would tell us that we
deserve better, that we matter,

01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
that we are more than we
ever dreamed possible.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And that there's light
at the end of the tunnel,

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that there is nobody in
the world quite like you.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
What if you knew in
every cell of your body

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that you were living a divine
plan, a plan so important,

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
