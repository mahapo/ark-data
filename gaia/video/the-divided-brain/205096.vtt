>> The brain is, of course, an
enormously complex structure.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's kind of
redundantly complex.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:10%
We have two cerebral
hemispheres.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes a
fascinating question

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to know whether the two
cerebral hemispheres can

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:90%
operate separately.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In the '60s and '70s
in California at Caltech,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
there was some incredibly
important and fascinating work.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
trying to do was

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
to improve the quality
of life for people

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:90%
with intractable epilepsy.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now these people might
have almost continuous

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
epileptic seizures.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Which meant that
they couldn't really

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
carry on any kind
of normal life.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The original idea was based
on the notion that if you

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
isolated a seizure to one
half the brain so it could not

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:84%
spread to the other half
brain, when a seizure occurred,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.283 align:middle line:84%
you would prevent a
generalized convulsion.

00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't spread
throughout the brain.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.075 align:middle line:84%
The patient wouldn't lose
generalized consciousness

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:90%
and you would have helped.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Today Michael Gazzaniga is
a world-renowned neuroscientist

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and vineyard owner.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, he was a
grad student participating

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%
in radical brain experiments.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> By sectioning this structure,
as can be seen in this half

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
brain section, called the corpus
callosum and it has over 2

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:90%
million nerve fibers.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And they richly interconnect
the two halves of the brain.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
What they did was, with
some trepidation initially,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to divide this corpus
callosum, the main pathway

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
by which the two
hemispheres communicate.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And what they found after the
operation was that the seizures

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:90%
largely stopped.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
The other thing was it
was possible by setting

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
it up carefully
controlled experiments

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to find out what the
reactions of the left

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and the right hemisphere
were independently.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Each side of the brain
controls the opposite side

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So the left hemisphere
controls the right side

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
of the body and the right
hemisphere communicates

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:90%
with the left.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The patient
looks at a screen.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine fixating on a dot.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And over here, we flash
a picture of an apple.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in the
right visual field.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:90%
That goes to your left brain.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Left brain's got
language and speech.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Patient said that's an apple.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
This time, you put the apple
over in the left visual field.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.890 align:middle line:84%
That now goes to the
right disconnected brain.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And you say to the
patient, what did you see?

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.268 align:middle line:84%
And the patient says,
I didn't see anything.

00:11:55.268 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Something on the left.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:10%
I know what it is.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:10%
I can't say it.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.796 align:middle line:10%
I want to, but I can't.

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:10%
I know what it is.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:10%
>> What's it have to do with?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I can't tell
you that, either.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>> They found that the left arm
and the right arm seem to be

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:90%
contradicting one another.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.147 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody would select
a dress with her right arm,

00:12:16.147 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
then the left arm would take it
back, and put it on the shelf,

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and take out another one.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Frustrated.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The experiments proved
that we have two brains

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:90%
in our heads.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Not just one.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But they do not see
the world the same way.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> When I started
to do psychiatry,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:84%
nothing much was said about
what the mass of the right

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere did.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
My training was that
the left hemisphere

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:84%
was very important for
understanding and language

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
and for speaking language.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But that really, what went
on in the right hemisphere

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
was not that significant.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Michael Gazzaniga had said
that the right hemisphere

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
of the human brain had
about as much intelligence

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:90%
as a chimpanzee.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And so that wasn't encouraging.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I used
to give a lecture.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The left hemisphere, don't
leave home without it.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And that summarized
the importance

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I saw to the special
modules, we call now systems,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:90%
in the left hemisphere.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
That's where the heavy
duty lifting comes

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:90%
for our complex cognitive life.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But in this experiment
with a split brain patient,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
while the right hemisphere
is trying to make the cube,

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
the left hemisphere's
hand keeps interfering.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
know what it's doing.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the right
hemisphere on its own

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.065 align:middle line:90%
solves the problem in seconds.

00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> All of those who were
involved in the team came

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to the conclusion that each
hemisphere had, if you like,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:84%
like a different way of
looking at the world.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You separate the
two hemispheres,

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
you've got mine left,
you got mine right.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It's what grabbed
everybody's interest.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can understand that.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the left talks
and is analytical

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and the right is creative
and pulls stuff together.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And boom.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:90%
It was an industry.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks to pop psychology,
the right and left hemispheres

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:90%
became cartoon characters.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
It was no longer
considered serious science.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The left does language and
reason and the right does airy,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.315 align:middle line:10%
fairy pictures of image.

00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And that turned out
not to be right.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Because what people
found was that over time,

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:84%
it was obvious that
each hemisphere

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:90%
engages in everything.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So each hemisphere--
right and left--

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
is involved in reason and
in language and in emotion.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:90%
But in crucially different ways.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the pop culture
understanding of the left

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and right hemisphere
was eventually rejected,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
a central question
still remained.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Why does the brain have
two centers of consciousness,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:84%
each capable of maintaining
consciousness on its own

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
involved in everything,
but in a different way?

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was only when I came to
look at the animal literature

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:90%
that just, the penny dropped.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Professor Gunturkun.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Iain.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> How nice of you to see me.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:90%
How are you, Iain?

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely to meet you.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Same with me.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I apologize for delays.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No problem at all.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:10%
This university is a maze.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Just completely lost.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an absolute maze.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Onur Gunturkun is a
leading researcher in the field

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:90%
of animal neurology.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:84%
He focuses on how birds use
each half of their brain.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the animals
with the eye rings.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Using the Velcro, you
can cover one eye at a time.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:57.325 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So there is a little
cap that we have.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the animal just sees
with its left or right eye.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you know, the
optic nerves cross completely.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything the right
eye sees goes to the left

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere and vise versa.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Gunturkun devised a test
where pigeons were trained

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
to recognize human beings
in vacation photos.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Each time the birds
recognized there

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
was a person in a picture,
they were rewarded.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>> After a while, they start to
understand there are pictures

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.840 align:middle line:10%
with humans and there are
pictures without humans.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:10%
>> But then the birds were
given a harder challenge.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Now we can start
to alter the pictures.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:10%
We cut out the head, we cut out
the arm, we cut out the trunk,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:10%
and spread it
across the picture.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
It is like a slaughtering scene.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
We take the pictures
and chop them

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
in smaller and smaller
and smaller pieces.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:90%
The left hemisphere says, OK.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I see a head.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I see eyes.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:90%
I see a nose.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a human.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm packing on it.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:10%
The right hemisphere now says,
this is no human anymore.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:10%
The right hemisphere
requires the correct position

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:10%
of the human body to
recognize the human.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So that means both hemispheres
are doing an excellent job.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Both hemispheres contribute.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And both hemispheres can
decide human or non-human,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
but they do it with different
cognitive strategies.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
When pigeons are
up to find food,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
they have to discriminate
grain from pebbles.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So that one hemisphere
is really concentrating

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
on the tiny little
details of the food,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
while the other one is
glancing into the environment.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And is on quick alert if an
aerial predator is coming.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> This is fundamental
to survival.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment
at which I realized

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
this is profoundly
important to all beings that

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
have to solve the conundrum
of how to eat and stay alive.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> McGilchrist realized
that in human beings,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
these two different kinds of
attention played out in much

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:90%
more complex ways.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You won't find a neurologist
anywhere in the world who will

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:84%
dispute that there is different
kinds of attention paid

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
by the left and
right hemisphere.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Then, very clearly,
each hemisphere

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:90%
must find a different world.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
What would those two
worlds look like?

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> McGilchrist observed that the
left hemisphere gives a narrow,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
sharply-focused
attention to detail.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:10%
Without understanding
the larger context.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:10%
It sees objects in relation
to their usefulness.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
It's in charge of
the right hand, which

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
has the power to
manipulate things

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:90%
such as tools and technology.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But it can't make
human connections.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't understand
relationships, humor,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:90%
tone of voice.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Things and people are not
unique and individual.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But groups that it
can organize, sort,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and file in a system of
rules and linear connections.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.780 align:middle line:84%
On its own, it has no
sense of the whole.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Even people are
seen as body parts.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:84%
The world of the left
hemisphere is lifeless.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It shatters the world
into an assortment of bits

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:90%
without meaning.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
The right hemisphere,
by contrast,

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
sees the broad
view of the world.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:90%
It is the master of the brain.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
It perceives an
interconnected world.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
It understands
relationships, body language,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:84%
facial expression,
and implicit meaning.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:84%
The right hemisphere
engages with life,

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.455 align:middle line:84%
understands movement,
story, and metaphor.

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.515 align:middle line:84%
It forces how humanity fits
into the whole of creation.

00:20:19.515 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:84%
The divided brain
gives us two types

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
of attention, two ways of
engaging with the world.

But the left hemisphere's
narrow kind of attention

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
reminded McGilchrist of
something else, our world.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
For the last 100 years, a way
of thinking which is reductive,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:90%
mechanistic has taken us over.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's enabled us to manipulate
the world, to grab resources,

The left hemisphere is
the quick and dirty one.

Because it has to make action.

But actually, this

Another important difference--
a very important one--

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
is that between fixity
and flow, so things

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
in the left
hemisphere are fixed.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the right
hemisphere, flow

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:90%
is what it sees and understands.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, that is very profound.

That actually changes the

Nothing is just isolated.

Iain's saying things that
other people haven't seen.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental
thing he's saying

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.668 align:middle line:84%
is the philosophical
notion that what matters

00:24:27.668 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:90%

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.562 align:middle line:10%
There are times when we're

when we're more

the, sort of, fetishization

>> These are not
people who are mad.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
These delusions are
mostly due to problems

in the right hemisphere.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So if anyone talks about
the right side of the brain

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and the left side of the brain,
that is my goal in life to find

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
a good balance between these
two ways of looking at the world

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:90%
and acting upon the world.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm convinced,
of course, that many

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of us with the two hemispheres
functioning beautifully

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.975 align:middle line:84%
have neglect for great
parts of the world.

00:31:53.975 --> 00:32:03.262 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.262 --> 00:32:05.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, one of the primary
features of the left hemisphere

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:10%
is that you often find this
enormous capacity for denial,

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.550 align:middle line:10%
this capacity to just ignore
things and keep them shut out.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I think what Iain's
trying to say

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
certain disconnection

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
from the natural world
gradually happening.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:84%
We're living in
cities much more.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.640 align:middle line:90%
We are distracted much more.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.367 align:middle line:84%
We have more claims
on our attention.

00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The problem is when a completely
urban life shuts you off

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:84%
from the ecological resources
that sustain the life you have.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.270 align:middle line:90%
They're all hidden from us.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our electricity,
our gas, our water,

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:84%
our food sources, we don't
know where they're coming from.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:10%
So there's a kind of
delusion, really, at the heart

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:10%
of modern urban life.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
This sort of implicit
understanding

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're a part of nature is
no longer a default position.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
People broadly accept climate
change as a global phenomenon,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
that humans are causing
it, that it's very serious,

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can and should
do something quickly,

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and that if we don't, there'll
be very serious effects.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But we live as if that
knowledge was not there.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.698 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.698 --> 00:33:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We've got to look at it from
the perspective of science

and perspective of technology,
from law, from culture,

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
from democracy, from
behavior, from money.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And to do that requires a form
of perception and understanding

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that isn't going to come
from the left hemisphere that

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.795 align:middle line:84%

But in each case, it
ended up with a movement

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.730 align:middle line:84%
further and further towards
that of the left hemisphere,

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:32.010 align:middle line:84%
after which the
civilization collapsed.

statues and paintings portrayed

individuals, people
with character.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.300 align:middle line:10%
But as the Roman
Empire declined,

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:50.930 align:middle line:10%
subjects often faced
forward without emotion.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Individual character
gave way to expressions

that distinguishes the right

hemisphere is the
concept of depth.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important one,
philosophically speaking.

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And one can think in
quite concrete terms

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:18.300 align:middle line:84%
of depth in space, depth in
time, and depth of emotion.

There is no depth
to this picture.

There is no landscape
that's situated

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:35.000 align:middle line:84%
in the natural world and nothing
to situate it historically.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
criticism of it to say

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't have such
depth or any relationship

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:43.810 align:middle line:90%

sense of temporal perspective,

that this event is taking place
at some point in the past,

the arts or the sciences

as being one hemisphere
or the other.

molded by our efforts to slice
through it with railway lines,

And we don't know to what
degree those things extend

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to other members of the species.

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:56.720 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Henrich and his
colleagues decided to take

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
their psychology tests
to the rest of the world,

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.920 align:middle line:90%
people in Tahiti and the Amazon.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:11.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the tests features
an optical illusion.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.600 align:middle line:10%
Which line is longer?

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.690 align:middle line:90%
They are both the same.

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Westerners have
the biggest illusion.

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And hunter gatherers don't
actually see the illusion.

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So they accurately
see the two lines.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
of right angles,

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
so our brains get really
good at converting

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that presence of right
angles in our environment

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and using that to create
a spatial understanding

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
in our brains.

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But in the world of
hunter gatherers,

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
there might not be
any right angles.

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:44.782 align:middle line:84%
So their brains are
calibrated more accurately.

01:07:44.782 --> 01:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%


01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's a basic difference
across human societies

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
as our minds adapt to the
culturally constructed world

01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:54.530 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

>> At Queen's
University in Canada,

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.330 align:middle line:10%
research is being done on
how Asian and Western minds

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:10.230 align:middle line:10%
perceive the world differently.

01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I grew up in China.

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I spent first 20
some years there.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It was not hard for me to
get interested in culture

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
because my own background.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
People think
differently, depending

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.080 align:middle line:90%
on their cultural background.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.630 align:middle line:10%
Compared to North
Americans, East Asians

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:29.540 align:middle line:10%
are more sensitive
to the context.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.520 align:middle line:10%
They attend more to the context.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
When we show people the pictures
of panda, monkey, banana,

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Chinese actually are more likely
to put monkey and the banana

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
together because
monkeys like banana.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.069 align:middle line:84%
So they focus on
that relationship.

01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:47.450 align:middle line:90%

Next, [INAUDIBLE]
is more linear?

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.399 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say it's the
dragonfly and the bee.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:00.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they're
both flying insects.

01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:01.005 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:03.979 align:middle line:90%


01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:06.410 align:middle line:10%
In traditional Chinese
and Japanese paintings,

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:10.680 align:middle line:10%
you do see less focus on
the individual person.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.859 align:middle line:90%
You barely see the face.

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:15.899 align:middle line:90%
You see the overall scenes.

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:16.890 align:middle line:90%
You see mountains.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:19.590 align:middle line:90%
You see trees, flowers.

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.802 align:middle line:84%
The person actually
is minimized.

01:09:22.802 --> 01:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> People get very uncomfortable
with the idea that culture

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
produces biological differences.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.225 align:middle line:84%
Because normally
in our minds, we

01:09:28.225 --> 01:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
separate biology and culture.

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So it certainly gives
you an appreciation

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
the degree to which
things you take

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to be just how the world
works or how people are

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:37.390 align:middle line:90%
is not the case.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a peculiarity of this
certain cultural trajectory

that you happened
to be born into.

balanced way of seeing reality

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:49.000 align:middle line:90%
may live within Western society.

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:01.510 align:middle line:10%
Probably the best

"an inlet into the mountains."

The way we look at the world
inside the Blackfoot mind,

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
what you would see
is a panoramic view.

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we fit in
into this whole picture?

01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And kind of drawing
on some of the work

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:27.730 align:middle line:90%
you've done, hey, that's very--

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
that's very right sided,
right brain thinking,

01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
looking at this big
picture how we fit in.

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the same time,
nothing is ever at a standstill.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:47.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what we refer
to as that flux.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is related--

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
physicists say this--
to everything else.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And is that also in the
wisdom and the culture

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.650 align:middle line:90%
of First Nation people?

01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> If you hear Native prayers,
they will talk about "all

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.780 align:middle line:90%
my relations."

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So when they're talking
about all my relations,

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
they're not talking
about human relations,

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
they're talking
about these trees.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
They're talking about the water.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> They're talking about the
rocks, those birds out there.

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.610 align:middle line:84%
All those animals,
they're all my relations.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> See?

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where we fit
ourselves into that relational

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%
network.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that suggest,
as it does to me,

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that rocks and lakes and streams
and waterfalls have a life.

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:42.550 align:middle line:90%
They're not just sort of things.

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all animate.

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In our way of thinking,
in fact, in Blackfoot,

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.040 align:middle line:90%
there is no word for inanimate.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why our
elders always come out and say,

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.770 align:middle line:90%
this is my church.

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.670 align:middle line:90%

>> Yeah.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.760 align:middle line:90%
This is me.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.000 align:middle line:90%

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:19.760 align:middle line:10%
>> If there are these competing
forms of perception and there

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.250 align:middle line:10%
are mechanisms culturally that
make them compete and play out

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:29.780 align:middle line:10%
and make one usurp the other,
and I think he argued that

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.585 align:middle line:10%
pretty coherently, then
we should act on it.

01:12:32.585 --> 01:12:34.710 align:middle line:10%
You know, we should figure
out what to do about it.

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:38.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The question is whether we
as persons have agency and are

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.790 align:middle line:10%
capable to do something and
whether we can translate that

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:42.590 align:middle line:10%
into society.

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%

There's no more blood there.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'll check the aneurysm
to make sure nothing's coming

It's very important
that in your mind

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
you have to say I'm
gonna get back there

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.120 align:middle line:90%
to where I was before.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to do everything
I was doing before

and the dogmas that
some people put upon us.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.910 align:middle line:90%
If we do that, we will have--

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:59.517 align:middle line:84%
we will be around as a
species for a long time.

01:14:59.517 --> 01:15:00.600 align:middle line:90%

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.788 align:middle line:90%
Let us hope.

>> I want my ideas to be
picked up by other people

01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and internalized so that they

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.830 align:middle line:90%
at the world in a different way.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Things that were
anciently known,

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
they were embodied
in myths, in drama,

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
in poetry, the way
of thinking that

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
was kept for the
kind of knowledge

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that logic can't reach, our way
of thinking, feeling and being.

Einstein said the rational
mind is a faithful servant,

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
but the intuitive mind
is a precious gift.

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a world
which honors the servant

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
but has forgotten the gift.

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:02.470 align:middle line:90%
We do need a paradigm shift.

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not about
little things here and there.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's about the whole way we
conceive what a human being is,

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
what the world is, and what
our relationship with it is.

Love is a pure attention to
the existence of the other.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's such a simple
thing, but it's so deep.

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I found it applies to
many, many things in life.

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Really what we're
on this planet to do

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is to give attention
to that other.

It can be other
people, but it can also

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
be what until very recently
was the other that we were all

surrounded by all
the time, which

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
was the natural world,
which is our home, which

01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is this completely amazing,
beautiful, staggeringly

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.260 align:middle line:90%
expressive gift.
