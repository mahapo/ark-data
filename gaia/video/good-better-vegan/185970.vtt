The sweet lupine seeds are
easy to store and process.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:90%
This is about 30 tons.

What can you make from 30 tons?

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
30 tons make about
150,000 liters of milk,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.306 align:middle line:90%
so that it's quite effective.

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Only a few kilometers from the
fields where the lupine grew,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:90%
the lupine milk is produced.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
This is where the basis for
lupine yogurt, lupine cocoa,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
and lupine ice cream is made.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Lupine milk can be used
just like normal milk that

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:90%
comes from a cow.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I can make my rice pudding with
it, I can eat it with my muesli

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
or drink it cold
out of the fridge.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no limits
to how I can use it.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the advantage, as I
don't have to give anything up.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Plant-based nutrition
is no longer

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
associated with sacrifice,
but with pleasure.

Although the lupine
platter is limited,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:84%
there are ecological benefits
to the local lupine not offered

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
by other important protein-rich
alternatives, such as soya.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:84%
35 million tons of soya are
imported by the EU each year,

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
mainly from South America.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of it is for
livestock fodder.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Large areas of rainforest
have been burnt down

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
to make way to farm the
monoculture, surface areas that

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:90%
once soaked up CO2.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the beans have
been genetically modified,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
yet the need for new
pesticides does not abate.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Soy is an important raw
material for many food products,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
such as baked goods, dairy
products, and cereal bars.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:84%
To process the beans
into protein products,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:90%
they need to be de-oiled.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So far, the oil is dissolved
in the toxic chemical hexane,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
which is not only harmful
for the environment,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:90%

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>> For 35 years, I myself
drank liters of milk according

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to the old tradition.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:90%
It's healthy.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Because my grandmother always
said that if I ate my dairy,

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:90%
I'd grow strong.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
These are rituals passed down,
conditioned modes of behavior.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was the
old moment when

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
you have this picture of a
cow that stands in the fields

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and eats grass and
gives milk, and then

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
when you realize that it's
a mother's milk that she's

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:90%
giving, that picture is ruined.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You've realized that we
inseminate cows, take

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:84%
their calves away from
them, slaughter them,

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and then the cows stand
there for five years

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.672 align:middle line:84%
before they're sent to
the abattoir themselves.

00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
where you say,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:90%
if only I'd know that earlier.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And these things happen.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
For me it was a
wake-up call, and I

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
think it's happening to a
lot of people at the moment.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Bredack wants to combine
ethical principles

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
with business
principles, and that

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:90%
seems to be working very well.

about food.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
That's where
veganism comes from.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.440 align:middle line:84%
For 20, 30 years, it was,
I'm different, you're shit,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm better because
I eat differently.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That was the elitist
claim to be different.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
What we did is that we
opened up the vegan world

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and made plant-based nutrition
accessible to the masses.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
We tore down barriers
and the preconceptions,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and what is happening
now is remarkable.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Many people are coming to us who
aren't vegan, nor vegetarian,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
they're just curious
to try the products,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and that brings in consumers.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We're tripling our
revenue every year.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%

Why do people eat meat
and other animal products?

Jean-Jacques Hublin
is finding the answers

in the prehistory
of human evolution.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
The anthropologist

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.315 align:middle line:84%
when apes were slowly
becoming humans.

00:14:13.315 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Our brain is about five
times the size it should be

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:10%
for a mammal our
size, our body size.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And the brain is a
very expensive tissue

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:90%
in terms of energy.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It takes about 20% for what we
call basal metabolism, which

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
is energy we produce
at rest, and this

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is consumed by an organ
that represent only 2%

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
of the body, so a huge cost.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Our early ancestors were
herbivore apes that lived

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:56.065 align:middle line:90%
in the trees.

00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
2 million years
ago, Homo erectus

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
was hunting small living
animals on the forest floor,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:90%
and brain size increased.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestor would cut the meat
from the bones with small stone

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:90%
tools.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But the second spectacular phase
of the brain growth of the Homo

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
only happened after the
discovery of fire and cooking

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
over 500,000 years ago.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason why cooking is
so important is because cooking

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
facilitates the way we can
incorporate this high energy,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
this food high and rich in
energy, especially meat.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we see another,
I would say, acceleration

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:90%
into the brain size in hominids.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
In the course of the
last 5 billion years,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
there is a spectacular
increase of the brain

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
size without any related
increases in the body size.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So the proportion between
brain and body change again.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> By studying the
isotopes in human bones,

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the scientists can ascertain
what humans were eating 500,000

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes evident.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:10%
From an evolutionary
perspective,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:10%
our metabolism is
still in the Stone Age.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We are good at storing
fat for bad times.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But as we no longer have to
hunt for the food ourselves,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
but more often than not sit
lazily on the sofa, we get ill.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Our extremely high energy diet
combined with little movement

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:84%
causes civilization diseases
such as cancer or diabetes.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But modern societies
are face a new challenge,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
which is changing our diet
another time and somehow

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
designing a new way of fueling
our body and our brain,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:84%
which is still needs
energy, but in, I would say,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
a more reasonable way
considering the way of life

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
modern humans have today.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The way we're living at
the moment is clearly not

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
compatible with our
evolutionary heritage.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are
too fat and suffer

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
from all types of
civilization diseases

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:90%
that are connected to our diet.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
At the Veggie World
Trade Fair in Paris,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
the healthy diet of
veganism is celebrated.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%

Now a wealth of other

>> Yes.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:10%
One tries to imitate milk
by adding flavorings,

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:10%
but also certain vitamins
that are in milk, whether it's

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:10%
calcium or B12.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
These are vitamins
that are vital when

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:90%
one is on a vegan diet.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And there is, of course,
sugar to give it more flavor.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Around a cube of sugar
for every 100 milliliters.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%

emulate milk and its nutrients.

recipes are expensive,

>> Many vegans miss cheese.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The base ingredient
is a type of oil.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So you need plant oil so it
looks like cheese and tastes

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.100 align:middle line:84%
like cheese, and you can't
do that without additives.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And what are the additives?

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> First you need a thickener
so the oil becomes a solid mass,

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and then natural coloring so it
has a nice yellow cheese color.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
More important is that you
can't do it without flavorings,

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
as plant oil doesn't
taste like cheese,

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the taste
we're trying to imitate.

cheese and milk substitutes

This is the trial of milk.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:10%
Milk is unique in its
nutritional makeup, a product

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:10%
that is traditional, that we've
been farming for 10,000 years,

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:10%
and that has a natural basis.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
All 1,200 French
cheese varieties

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
are made from the
natural food milk.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:10%
Whether soy, oat,
or almond milk,

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:10%
there are concrete
economic interests

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:10%
which have led to a
true labeling war.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
The description milk is only
allowed with coconut milk

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.276 align:middle line:90%
for traditional reasons.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no real
disagreement on this.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:90%
The situation is clear.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The description of milk and milk
products is consumer-protected.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.530 align:middle line:84%
As a consumer, I
have to be informed

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that when I buy cheese,
butter, or milk,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that these are real
dairy products.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Jan Bredack considers the
argument as superfluous and not

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
in the interests
of the consumer.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] >>
We're not allowed to write

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:84%
on our products that
they're cholesterol-free,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:90%
although they are.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.090 align:middle line:10%
That would be a
competitive disadvantage

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:10%
for the meat and dairy industry
as their products contain

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:10%
cholesterol.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:10%
The second issue relevant
for me here in Germany

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.030 align:middle line:10%
is the tax disadvantages.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
For a milk substitute,
you pay 19% VAT.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
For milk from a sheep,
goat, or cow, you pay 7%.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
These are things that have been
secured where the lobbyists

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:90%
have done their work well.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:10%
Consumer issues like
these are negotiated

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:10%
in the corridors of the EU
in Brussels and in court.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:90%
It is a billion-dollar industry.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The already shaken
milk farmers in Europe

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.622 align:middle line:84%
are fighting for the image
of milk as a quality product.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Misdescribing products that
rely on a good reputation,

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that have acquired the good
image of milk is not new.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
We've known this since
the era of Napoleon III.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:84%
For him, good butter was too
expensive for his troops,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.810 align:middle line:90%
so margarine was invented.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:10%
Since Napoleon III,
cheap margarine

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.990 align:middle line:10%
has conquered its
place in many kitchens,

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:10%
and history seems to
be repeating itself.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
This Ruegenwalder
Muehle is a symbol

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
for the traditional meat and
sausage industry in Germany.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The business has been
undergoing radical change

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
since its marketing and
development head, Godo Roben,

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:84%
added vegetarian
and soon vegan meats

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.252 align:middle line:90%
to the company's repertoire.

00:31:07.252 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.213 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been producing
meats for 182 years.

00:31:12.213 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:10%
And when I came up
with the idea that we

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:10%
should make vegetarian products,
there were murmurs of why?

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:10%
But the numbers
justified so easily.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:10%
It's not the 7 million
vegetarians the 1 million

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:10%
vegans, but the 14 million
flexitarians that are saying,

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.650 align:middle line:10%
I want to consume
less meat and sausage.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:84%
A serious argument
is you don't want

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.558 align:middle line:84%
to lose, to the cheese
and Nutella industry,

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
but you want to offer them
contemporary products.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.560 align:middle line:84%
An appointment at the
Ruegenwalder base.

seriously they take this.

How do they even do it?

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:10%
How is the production of
these foods different?

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:90%
And yes, what is the motivation?

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:90%

Anna-Lena finds it hard to
even look at these products.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But the enterprise already
has 11 meatless variations

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in its repertoire, two
of which are vegan.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It took three years for the
first vegetarian sausage

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:90%
to be brought to the market.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:84%
For Anna-Lena, the change
can't come fast enough.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.192 align:middle line:90%

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
It is a funny
feeling, but I think

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
it is moving in the
right direction.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that in the
future, animal products

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:90%
will decrease a lot.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And that one day this
venture will only produce

against vegetarian and vegan

products was considerable,
even within the company.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Yet, success was on
Godo Roben's side.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
The company has had
to hire more staff

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.352 align:middle line:84%
to produce the non-meat
products in three shifts.

00:33:31.352 --> 00:33:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We haven't had much
growth in recent years.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We would have had
about 1%, 2% plus.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've introduced
vegetarian products,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
our growth is in double figures.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
We make about 50
million euros a year

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:90%
with our vegetarian products.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.608 align:middle line:90%
That's 20% of our total revenue.

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's really something
happening in Germany,

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:53.010 align:middle line:90%
it's not about to stop.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the vegetarian
offer, the company

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:90%
is increasing its vegan platter.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Vegan makes business sense.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Veganz founder, Bredack, wants
to conquer the European market

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:90%

But there's more from
Carrefour in Spain,

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:10%
but that has an
effect on France.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:22.290 align:middle line:10%

yes, but it's a megatrend,

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.965 align:middle line:84%

minimum of about 30 years.

00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the reason why

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:84%
people are changing their
lives and their behavior,

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
then the first priority is their
health and their well-being,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:84%
but environmental aspects are
also being put on the table.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Our consumption is
leaving a footprint,

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.712 align:middle line:90%
and you can't wipe it away.

00:35:07.712 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
There's more and more
people in the world

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and not enough resources.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And the focus on feeding animals
means some people go hungry.

people in 20, 30, 40 years,

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the planet will be
too small for us,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and we will have to
consume directly,

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.450 align:middle line:84%
meaning we have to
eat plants themselves

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:84%
because they have a
much higher yield.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:10%
For a kilo of meat, I
need 16 kilos of grain

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.717 align:middle line:10%

Whilst here in the

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:36.170 align:middle line:84%
you can see every animal,
make a connection to it,

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
it's a sentiment

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:51.500 align:middle line:84%
artificial meat made

have in their muscle stem

cells.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:10%
They are designated
skeletal muscle stem cells,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:10%
they can only produce
muscle tissue.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're sitting
there doing nothing,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:84%
waiting to repair the
muscle when it's injured.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:90%
That's their role in life.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.790 align:middle line:84%
They can do that
inside the body,

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:84%

that outside of the body.

The first hamburger
grown in the laboratory.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Cost-- $250,000 for one patty.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It took the scientists
three months

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to grow the hamburger
from the stem cells,

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
quicker than a cow would
ever be able to do it.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, the
technique could also

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:90%
work with chicken and lamb.

that small sample to culture

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:84%
sufficient cells
for that hamburger,

if you calculate--

and the number of doubling
that you can get out

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
of these cells,
that small sample

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.720 align:middle line:84%
could produce 10,000
kilos of meat.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Two stem cells could
potentially become 10 tons

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of meat, and no cow, sheep,
or chicken would need to die

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:19.770 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Will the meat of

have for the environment?

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We have 1 and 1/2
billion cows on this planet.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And this technology still
would require some cows,

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
because they need to
donate those stem cells.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But you could go down from 1
and 1/2 billion to, say, 30,000,

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.990 align:middle line:90%
35,000 across the world.

Can the greenhouse gases

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:90%
be drastically reduced?

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Artificial meat from

efficient, and ecological.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Could eating meat be a way to
prevent animal cruelty and save

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:90%
the planet?

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.472 align:middle line:84%
Only if it tastes
good and comes cheap.

00:40:09.472 --> 00:40:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> With the current
technology, if we scale up,

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the cost would be
about $65 per kilo--

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:90%
so about 50 euro per kilo.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.005 align:middle line:84%
Which is still expensive, it's
still 30 times more expensive

00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:84%
than what we have
right now, but that's

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.422 align:middle line:84%

we need to--

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:33.000 align:middle line:84%
we are looking for to
get that price down.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The consumption of animal
products such as meat, milk,

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:84%

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:84%

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of making milk and
cheese in bioreactors.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:90%
No animals needed at all.

whatever organism it is--

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:90%
is used to produce that.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And add water and other
substances and fat, maybe,

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:90%
to create the same product.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a great idea,
because milk is a problematic--

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.856 align:middle line:84%
probably as problematic as meat
is a problematic commodity.

00:41:22.856 --> 00:41:28.100 align:middle line:90%

This is where the computer
revolution of the 20th century

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:90%

Apple, Intel, Google, and Coke.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:84%
In the 21st century,
the biotech revolution

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is to follow the digital
one, and once again, it all

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.210 align:middle line:90%
starts in an old garage.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Near Berkeley
University, biohackers

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:84%
come together to make vegan
cheese out of marine mammals.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
What may seem impossible
at first glance

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:84%
could become a reality when
you take a closer look.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The narwhal is just
because it's kind of cold--

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:10%
because we can do it.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:12.110 align:middle line:10%
We can do any mammal that
has had its genome sequenced.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
really sort of to get

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.050 align:middle line:90%
people excited about the idea.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we can do something
really different because--

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.000 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's probably very
hard to milk a narwhal.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody's ever
made narwhal cheese before.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is showing
that not only can we

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.830 align:middle line:84%
reproduce things that
already exist in the world--

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.500 align:middle line:84%
cow milk cheese, we can
do some really new things

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.158 align:middle line:84%
that are really only
possible this way.

00:42:32.158 --> 00:42:33.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Basically this is
pretty much like the--

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Modern gene technology
makes it possible,

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.750 align:middle line:10%
as does the internet.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:10%
One can buy genetic mammal
material, exactly the part

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:10%
the cow's the milk
proteins, proteins

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:10%
that can be mass-reproduced
within bacteria or yeast cells.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's pretty easy to order the
plasmid complete with your gene

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.848 align:middle line:90%
of interest in it.

00:42:52.848 --> 00:42:54.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we've done here.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's got that gene
that tells the yeast how

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to make this particular
protein, and it's

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:90%
got a few other features, too.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:84%
It actually tells the yeast once
that protein's made, kick it

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.690 align:middle line:90%
out of the yeast cell.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.490 align:middle line:84%
That makes it easier
to purify afterwards.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> At no stage in the process
is an animal involved.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, it should be
possible to genetically create

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.030 align:middle line:84%
vegan milk proteins
in yeast cells,

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:84%
just as insulin is being
produced in yeast cells

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, the biohackers from the
Counter Culture Lab in Berkeley

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:84%
are locking a human breast
milk protein into a yeast cell.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It would be the first component
of artificial human breast

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:84%
milk that together with
plants, oil, sugar, and water,

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.290 align:middle line:84%
could form the basis
for a vegan cheese.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it, right?

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.638 align:middle line:90%
>> 4.9, almost exactly right.

00:43:54.638 --> 00:43:55.448 align:middle line:90%
Good time.

00:43:55.448 --> 00:43:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome!

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Phew!

00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so now we pull it out--

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.128 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm still alive.

00:44:01.128 --> 00:44:01.928 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:01.928 --> 00:44:05.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The theoretical path to
making vegan cheese is known.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The practical implementation
with donated equipment

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:84%
from the biotech industry
seems controllable, possible.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.380 align:middle line:10%
Even the implementation
of a protocol

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.100 align:middle line:10%
by a colorful mix of academic
amateurs, biocomputer

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.290 align:middle line:10%
scientists geologists, software
engineers, and chemists

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:10%
is possible.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet, milk proteins
are very complex.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:84%
If it were that simple, we
would already have vegan cheese.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.560 align:middle line:84%
A long and rocky
road lies ahead.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>> The real challenge is this.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.803 align:middle line:84%
It will be isolating
the proteins,

00:44:37.803 --> 00:44:40.220 align:middle line:84%
getting them really pure after
they come out of the yeast,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.880 align:middle line:84%
because of course the yeast is
making other protein as well.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And then reconstructing
these several proteins

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.950 align:middle line:84%
to make the larger
protein structure.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And this has been done
in the literature when

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:55.580 align:middle line:84%
these proteins have been
isolated individually

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.950 align:middle line:84%
from the mammalian sources, but
we've never done it from yeast.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we get everything
exactly right,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it will work the same way,
but if anything's a little bit

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.883 align:middle line:84%
different, we may have
to do some extra work

00:45:07.883 --> 00:45:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to reconstruct those micelles.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The relevant American
supervising body, the FDA,

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:18.140 align:middle line:84%
has no concerns
regarding vegan cheese,

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:22.160 align:middle line:84%
but cheese from human breast
milk meets resistance.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
These are cultural reservations
that weigh heavily on this.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.420 align:middle line:84%
As heavily as the
reservations of many

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:84%
a Frenchmen about a
vegan cooking school

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:84%
being set up in Normandy,
the heart of the French milk

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and cheese industry.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.730 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
Deborah Pivain has done.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:44.150 align:middle line:10%
She's convinced that fantastic
French cuisine does not

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:47.360 align:middle line:10%
have to exhaust itself
by serving ortolan

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:10%
drowned in Armagnac forever.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The universe of the
vegan taste spectrum

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.680 align:middle line:90%
has barely been explored.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we have every taste?

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Right now we cannot
have every taste,

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.510 align:middle line:90%
we cannot have every texture.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But because we're so adventurous
and we want to find new things,

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:10.220 align:middle line:84%
we do cooking with things
that no one would ever

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:90%
have thought of using before.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are not reduced to using
a small amount of products.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.610 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, the
door is wide open.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> In this sense, veganism could
even be the key to a whole new

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:28.010 align:middle line:90%
gourmet cuisine.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:90%
