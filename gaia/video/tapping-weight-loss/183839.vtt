00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So many of us struggle with
stress in our daily lives.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle line:84%
If we don't deal with the stress
and stored emotional trauma,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:84%
it can be impossible to
lose weight and keep it off.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm delighted to
share this program with you.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.307 align:middle line:84%
Tapping is a simple and
powerful healing modality

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that's proven incredibly
useful in relieving

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:90%
stress and resolving trauma.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And once you learn this
technique, it's yours forever.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:84%
My colleague Carol Look and I
created this in-depth program

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
to help you access and deal
with the emotional issues that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
may be the source of your
weight struggles and help

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.573 align:middle line:90%
you end them once and for all.

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

>> I have a business
that is 25 years old.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And for the past five years,
we've been struggling.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We're at a point where we're
holding it on by a thread.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm struggling with a lot
of different stress issues--

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:84%
work-related, finance-related,
relationship-related, just

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
general life, what on Earth
am I doing, question-related.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Kari.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:90%

My name is Marlen.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm a 66-year-old.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.107 align:middle line:84%
And I come originally
from the Netherlands.

00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Living on the South
Shore of Long Island,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I was affected pretty
dramatically by Hurricane

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Sandy.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And when the storm
hit, it basically

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
took out the whole first
floor of my home, which

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is where I had, a
year before, moved

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:90%
my elderly mom in with me.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Saeed Nigeeb.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm 19 years old.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm from the beautiful city
of Vancouver, British Columbia.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Sally, and
I'm from Connecticut.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:90%

>> I'm Mariam.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm 40.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, my main
stressor is from school.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Late nights, long hours, papers.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that, if I
recollect over my life,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that the times that I've
struggled the most with

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
my weight are the times that
I can point to and say, oh,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I was definitely stressed out.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've been
trying to find a job,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
which is very difficult.
Financially, it's kind of hard.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
So I really need to find work.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Bridget.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm 55 years old.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:90%
And I live in Long Island.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Jon.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I am 37 years old.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm from Yonkers, New York.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Jaqueline.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm 44.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm from Westchester County.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm working on two things.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
The first is ways to compensate
for my emotional eating

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and then also ways to
maintain a work-life balance.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I wish I really knew
what the main stress issue.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I feel stressed a lot.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:90%
I have anxiety in my body daily.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I really firmly believe
that weight and stress

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
are intimately involved.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Being a firefighter is
particularly stressful for many

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
reasons, mostly being just
the day-to-day turmoil that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:90%
I tend to tune myself out.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I don't pay
attention when I'm eating.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't pay attention
to a lot of things

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:90%
that are going on around me.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And not paying
attention to myself

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
leads to me gaining weight
and not taking care of myself

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:90%
properly.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So Carol, thanks very
much for joining us.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jon.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I love sharing this
with everybody that I can,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.337 align:middle line:84%
because it's been so useful
in my life and for my clients.

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you a little
bit about my background.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.378 align:middle line:84%
I was trained as a
traditional psychotherapist,

00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
regular one-to-one
therapy and group therapy.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I worked in an
addictions agency.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So I was a professional
in helping people

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.428 align:middle line:90%
stop drinking and drugging.

00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And we also worked with
the family members.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what would happen
is people would stop drinking

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and they would start
gaining weight.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.358 align:middle line:84%
Or they would start
picking up something else,

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't dealing
with the bottom line--

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
their emotions and their
feelings and their stress,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.472 align:middle line:84%
because in beginning
counseling, you're not

00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go to the biggies.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.592 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
leave those until later,

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:90%
when someone has some traction.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.777 align:middle line:84%
So sure enough, people
would gain weight

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:27.793 align:middle line:90%
and be unhappy about that.

00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I was working in the agency.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in a
private practice as well.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was frustrated
with the results.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Talk therapy is
wonderful when it works.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But I like results,
and I wanted more.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So I got extensive
training in hypnosis.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was really
exciting about the brain

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and how we work in our
left and right brain.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:90%
And someone in my class said--

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
my training-- said, you
think this is exciting?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Wait until you try
this new tapping thing.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, tapping has been
around for 30 years.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't that new.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%
This was in 1997.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So I took my first couple
of courses in tapping,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:90%
got all excited about it.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to my clients I
was trained in this new stress

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
relief technique.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Would you be willing
to do five minutes

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:90%
at the end of your session?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't work,
you don't like it,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.062 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you the five minutes.

00:05:10.062 --> 00:05:11.227 align:middle line:90%
And so there was no loss.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing that
with the weight loss

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.313 align:middle line:90%
and the quit smoking people.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the next
week, they would come back

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and say, this is weird.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I did it by myself.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I feel different.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:90%
It was just fascinating.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything changed.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So then I started moving
over from the hypnosis field

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:90%
into the tapping.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And for 17 years, I've
done mostly tapping.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So what exactly is tapping?

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:90%
And why does it work?

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is
we borrowed from

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:90%
traditional Chinese medicine.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So acupuncturists-- there
are meridians or pathways,

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:84%
circuits of energy--
they call it chi--

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:90%
that flow through our body.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And Chinese doctors
believe that in order

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to have health,
mental and physical,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:84%
you need to have a smooth
flowing of this energy

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:90%
or electricity.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And if you have any symptoms--

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.053 align:middle line:84%
cravings, stress, insomnia,
outbursts of anger--

00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
if you have any
of those symptoms,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:90%
it means there's some blockage.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:90%
So we don't use needles.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
We use a tapping
motion, very light

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.172 align:middle line:84%
tapping, on the same points
that an acupuncturist--

00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying when an
acupuncturist will put a needle

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.065 align:middle line:84%
here, a needle there, and
it'll unblock this energy flow

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's how
you get healthier.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
But you're not doing that.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You're actually just taking that
point and you're tapping on it.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And by tapping on it,
it somehow unblocking

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
the flow of this energy.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So we take the primary
meridians, the circuitry,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and we tap on the end point.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.275 align:middle line:84%
So there are points that
are easier to get to.

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are points that
have been mapped out through

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine over
thousands of years.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thousands of years ago.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that the idea?

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're taking
those points,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.282 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking
the end points and--

00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And just tapping
very lightly on them.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And by tapping, it's
somehow releasing the blockage

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.387 align:middle line:84%
that's caused by the
stress or the pain.

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:49.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:50.771 align:middle line:84%
What they think is
going on is-- let's

00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
say you have a
stressful situation.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.912 align:middle line:84%
And it's making
you eat and choose

00:06:54.912 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
food or alcohol or cigarettes,
whatever your drug of choice

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
What I would say to you
is focus on that stress.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, Jon
would call up the file.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:90%
He'd open the document.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And while that's open,
we do the tapping,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
which seems to send signals
to that part of the brain

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:90%
to calm it down.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So we've now paired the stress
with a stress relief technique.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think there's
more research to be done.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we don't entirely
know why it's working.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But for, I guess, 28,
29 years, maybe longer,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
practitioners have been
having incredible results

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
in all fields, all challenges--
emotional, physical, mental,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.775 align:middle line:84%
>> See, for me, I love
a technique like this.

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:41.963 align:middle line:84%
Because even though
we don't 100%

00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
know why it works, because we
don't understand this energy

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:90%
channels.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.528 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face
it, modern medicine,

00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
we don't even acknowledge
that we have these life force

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
meridians that have been
studied for thousands of years

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:90%
by other cultures.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But even though we don't
fully understand it,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
it works really well.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And there's no downside.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I like
about a technique like this,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.203 align:middle line:84%
because, at the
very least, you're

00:08:02.203 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
going to get a little
bit of stress reduction.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be calmer.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.375 align:middle line:84%
At the very most,
you're going to break

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
through some massive
trauma that's

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.585 align:middle line:84%
been blocking you or sabotaging
you or causing weight gain

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and causing pain in
every area of life.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
I love situations like that,
where you have all upside

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and no downside.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And interesting you
talk about hypnosis,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
because I started trying
hypnosis for weight loss

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and got a little bit
of success with that.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And the hypnotherapist
introduced me

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:90%
to the tapping technique.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And we actually had
a tapping session.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was back in 2001,
when no one ever heard of it.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
the weirdest thing.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.846 align:middle line:84%
And I was really amazed that we
did these little simple things.

00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen is
we'd talk about an issue.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.675 align:middle line:90%
I'm stressed out at work.

00:08:45.675 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So this stress
thing, we do this.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.365 align:middle line:90%
I'm stressed.

00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:48.165 align:middle line:90%
Duh, duh, duh,.

00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:90%
We do this thing.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
bring another issue up

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
that's something
with my relationship.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And we'd do that.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.408 align:middle line:90%
And that would come up.

00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing--
and it was like layers.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And each time it got the
one stress out of the way,

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.487 align:middle line:84%
the next thing would come up
until there was nothing left.

00:09:01.487 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And then I felt different.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.112 align:middle line:84%
I felt different
about the situation.

00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
When I tried to think
about my working

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
relationships with my business
partner, it didn't bother me.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
When I tried to think
about the thing that

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
was bothering me
in my relationship,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:90%
it didn't bother me anymore.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like it was blocked,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:90%
like my mind didn't go there.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And the emotional
reaction didn't go there.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And because the emotional
reaction didn't go,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry wasn't
there anymore.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And it made it much easier
for me to lose weight.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And that set me on a
path where I learned

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with stress.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I started doing meditation.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I started doing visualization.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I started doing yoga and Qigong
and all these different things

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to help deal with stress.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And that put me on a path.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.538 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I did that
that I was able to then lose

00:09:41.538 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:90%
over 200 pounds.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it
was really effortless.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Stress doesn't just
cause you to eat.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It causes chemistry in your
body, this whole cascade

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of chemicals, that actually
forces you to gain weight.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It actually tricks
your body into thinking

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:90%
you're starving to death.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:84%
You could have 200 pounds of
excess weight on your body.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And the chemicals, the
chemistry in your body,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
actually tricks your brain
into thinking you have no fat.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
How does your brain
know how fat you are?

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.662 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think
about that for a second?

00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Your brain's here,
and your body's here.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
How does your brain
know how fat you are?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's signals.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Your fat cells send
signals to your brain.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.258 align:middle line:84%
The more fat you have,
the more signals you get.

00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when there's
a lot of signals,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:90%
it's a hormone called leptin.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a lot
of leptin, your brain

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, look at
all that leptin.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%
We have must be loaded with fat.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's lose weight.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Your metabolism speeds up.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:90%
You're not hungry.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:90%
All these things happen.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:90%
You lose weight effortlessly.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But a scenario takes place,
because of stress and trauma,

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
where the brain
cannot hear leptin.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can have 200
pounds of excess weight.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
You can have leptin
all over the place.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And your brain's
just not hearing it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So imagine this
scenario for a second.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you've got 200 pounds
of excess weight on you.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Your brain thinks you're
starving, because the chemistry

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:90%
is getting interrupted.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The signals are
getting interrupted.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.627 align:middle line:84%
And the brain's not able
to hear how much weight you

00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
have on you.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.065 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
that chemistry goes away.

00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like you wake up
one day, and your brain

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
realizes you've got 200
pounds of excess weight.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You're brain goes,
oh my god, where

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:90%
did all this weight come from?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.922 align:middle line:90%
How did I get 200 pounds?

00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:90%
It's overnight to your brain.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.422 align:middle line:90%
That's really what's happening.

00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And you're not hungry anymore.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, when I
say that losing the weight

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
was effortless, I mean
it was effortless,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
because my body didn't
want it anymore.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
My brain could hear
the chemistry properly.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And the weight just
fell off of me.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from
dealing with stress.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, weight can come from
a lot of different issues.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.212 align:middle line:90%
But we all have stress.

00:11:42.212 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:90%
We all have emotional trauma.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And those, the chemistry
that takes place in your body

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
during those times,
causes this interruption,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:90%
causes the problem.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you try to lose weight
without addressing this,

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
you are driving with
the emergency brake on.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, this
tapping is so beautiful,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's five minutes,
10 minutes at home.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
That's it, once you
learn the technique.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a
tool for getting

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
your brain and your body to
work together so that weight

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.543 align:middle line:90%
loss can be effortless.

00:12:09.543 --> 00:12:12.924 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So step number
1-- choose a target.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a target
to aim this technique at.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:90%
And a target can be an emotion.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It can be a symptom--

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:90%
if you have migraine headaches.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It can be an event,
a memory of an event.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
When we work on trauma,
that's what we do.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And you want to choose
something very clear,

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
not, oh, I have low
self-esteem or I'm overweight,

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:90%
but I have high anxiety.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Or I'm very stressed out.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:90%
So you choose a target.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And you measure how you
feel about it, how strong,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
how upsetting the target
makes you feel on a zero

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:90%
to 10 point scale.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So for this first exercise,
I'm going to talk about stress

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and so that everyone
can participate.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we're doing
stress, I want all of you

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to think of a particular
stressor in your life.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So work, home, weight,
body, something.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you think of
it, how upset do you get?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.288 align:middle line:90%
How intense is it, zero to 10?

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And if it's zero, you
probably shouldn't be thinking

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.235 align:middle line:90%
Think about something else.

00:13:11.235 --> 00:13:12.535 align:middle line:90%
>> If it's zero-- exactly.

00:13:12.535 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no reason to
do a tapping at zero.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're trying out.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So then we start tapping on
what's called the karate chop

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen a
karate master on television

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:84%
chop a block in half,
it's right on that part

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:90%
of the hand, either hand.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And we start there.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.262 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part
that some people--

00:13:28.262 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
they feel a little
awkward with it.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is
we name the problem.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we'll
just say I have this stress.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:90%
We'll just make that blanket.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have this stress,
I deeply and completely accept

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and completely
respect myself.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK anyway.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Something that helps you stop
pushing against yourself.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Part of the stress for
people with weight loss

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:90%
is, I hate myself.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.887 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it well.

00:13:52.887 --> 00:13:53.845 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done it well.

00:13:53.845 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:90%
I failed again.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm ashamed.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So we just say, here's
where I am, and I'm OK.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:90%
So we start there.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So you all have
chosen your stress

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that you're thinking about
and a number connected to it.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:90%
So we start here.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
And we say--

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.488 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're tapping
with all four fingers.

00:14:08.488 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, some of you have
already learned this before.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And you see people doing this
with both karate chop points.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm right-handed.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I learned the
tapping this way.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So I tap like this,
my four fingers

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:84%
on that particular
karate chop's point.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And then you just repeat this.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You say, even though
I have this stress.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
have this stress.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody can say it.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Even though I have this stress.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
have this stress.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and
completely accept myself.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and
completely accept myself.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.065 align:middle line:84%
>> And if that's hard to say,
that's information for you.

00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:39.148 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty good feedback
if you can't say that.

00:14:39.148 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And we do it two or three times.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have
this intense stress.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
this intense stress.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.563 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's really bothering me.

00:14:45.563 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's really bothering me.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and profoundly
love and accept myself.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and profoundly
love and accept myself.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Do it a third time.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have
this profound stress.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
this profound stress.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and completely love
and accept who I am anyway.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I deeply and completely love
and accept who I am anyway.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Then we start tapping.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I use two fingers
of my dominant hand.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And we start tapping on
these specific points

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:90%
that they mapped out.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Roger Callahan originally used
these points in the tapping way

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:84%
back when with
Thought Field Therapy.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So the first point
is at the beginning

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:90%
of the hair of either eyebrow.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's not your third eye.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not right at your nose.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning of the hair.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> In the middle?

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Or on the other side?

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Beginning of the hair.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Of either side?

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, either side.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
You can do your right side of
your body or the left side.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They've actually done some
tests with lighting us up

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
while we're tapping.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead, right here.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
The first is called
the eyebrow endpoint.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
While we're tapping here,
we tune into the problem.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.718 align:middle line:84%
We say the problem so we
don't get distracted by noise

00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and thinking of other thoughts.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:90%
We want to be in it.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
You want to be in it in
order to move things.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So start tapping at
the eyebrow point

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and say, this intense stress.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> This intense stress.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.373 align:middle line:84%
The next point is the side
of the eye, either one.

00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It's little bone right here.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:90%
They're all on bones.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And you can do either side.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:90%
This intense stress in my life.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> This intense
stress in my life.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The next point
is under your eye.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.942 align:middle line:84%
They call it the bony
orbit, right there.

00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right in the middle?

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right in the middle.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
This intense stress
I'm dealing with.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> This intense stress
I'm dealing with.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are all critical
endpoints of the meridians,

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:90%
the circuits or the pathways.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The next point is your upper
lip, right below your nose.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:90%
This stress I'm dealing with.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.388 align:middle line:90%
>> This stress I'm dealing with.

00:16:30.388 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're just tapping
lightly and just tapping long

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.847 align:middle line:84%
enough to say the phrase,
whatever we're focused on.

00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The next one's called
your chin point.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually above
your chin, below your lip,

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:90%
right in the crease there.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:90%
This stress I'm dealing with.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.727 align:middle line:90%
>> This stress I'm dealing with.

00:16:44.727 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The next point is called
your collarbone point.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese
acupuncture, it's K 27.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.335 align:middle line:84%
It's right at the bottom,
those funny little knobs

00:16:52.335 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:90%
there that come down.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Show me

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.642 align:middle line:84%
>> So you would be
right-- it's right below.

00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:57.475 align:middle line:90%
So it's right there.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:90%
So there's a bone right here.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a bone.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:90%
The knobs right there.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.633 align:middle line:90%
>> And I go underneath it.

00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:03.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Under and a little
bit to the side.

00:17:03.569 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:90%
>> So you feel the bone?

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Feel the little knobs,
and go right under.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You feel the bone, and
then you go right under.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a soft spot.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.614 align:middle line:90%
>> A little tender.

00:17:07.614 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's tender.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's easier for you, just
put your hand out in a palm

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:84%
and go where the knot of
a man's tie would fall.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
And you're covering
both of them.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So you can do that or you can
just do tapping like that.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.088 align:middle line:84%
So this is the next one,
the collarbone point.

00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:90%
And we just say it again.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:90%
This intense stress.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> This intense stress.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The next point
is under the arm.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you have a seam going up
your body left to right, about

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
four inches below your armpit.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:90%
See that?

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Tap right there.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It might be tender
for some of you.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Another acupuncture endpoint.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:90%
This intense stress.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> This intense stress.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we end on
the top of the head.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people start
on the top of the head.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We're just getting
the main meridian.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The very top.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very top.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Important place where
many acupuncture points

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:90%
come together.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We tap around there
in a little circle.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.228 align:middle line:84%
And we just name
the problem again.

00:17:59.228 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
This intense stress
I'm dealing with.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> This intense stress
I'm dealing with.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Then you just take a deep
breath to keep moving

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:90%
the energy along the pathways.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And there's no right or wrong.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We go back to the number and the
issue you addressed and brought

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.752 align:middle line:90%
up and measure it again.

00:18:17.752 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So you weren't
measuring something.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.752 align:middle line:84%
But you all were
measuring something.

00:18:20.752 --> 00:18:21.875 align:middle line:90%
So tune back in.

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Think about it again.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't change topics.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:90%
How's your number?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any questions about
when we were doing it with you?

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm feeling a difference.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't--

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> You're feeling a difference.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't even measure him.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other thing
that happens in group work,

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.363 align:middle line:84%
is that people say, oh,
this isn't my issue.

00:18:37.363 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll just let them do it.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And I say, hey.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Hey, wait a minute.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the
mechanics of it,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
we're accessing the circuitry
of energy or electricity

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
in your body and
calming you down.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And even my most skeptical
clients would say, OK, well,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:90%
maybe I feel a little better.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Or they'd say, physically, they
feel a little more relaxed.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the least
benefit you'll get.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I say that,
in a situation like this,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
using a technique like this,
at the very, very least--

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking
rock bottom least,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lower
your stress level.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And simply by doing
that, it's going

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
to make it infinitely easier
for you to lose weight.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the rock bottom least
that you can expect from it.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And to me, as a worst case
scenario, that's perfect.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.158 align:middle line:90%
I have one question.

00:19:22.158 --> 00:19:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Do we just keep saying
this intense stress?

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.742 align:middle line:84%
Or do we say other
things as we're tapping?

00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in the very
beginning of tapping,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.588 align:middle line:90%
it was ultra simple.

00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you chose an anxiety.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
You would say, this anxiety,
this anxiety, this anxiety.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.813 align:middle line:84%
And when the person is
sitting in front of me,

00:19:36.813 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
they've told me a little
bit more about their story.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So I might say, this intense
stress, oh, it really

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:90%
bothers me.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:90%
That boss is really annoying.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can't believe I'm going--

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.875 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're not telling
their story now because you

00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:90%
don't know the story.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:90%
You're trying to make it.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.628 align:middle line:90%
So if we don't know the story--

00:19:51.628 --> 00:19:53.045 align:middle line:84%
>> You just say
the same phrasing.

00:19:53.045 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> This intense stress.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And you think about it.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
a reminder phrase

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.092 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you're tuned in
and not getting distracted.

00:19:59.092 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So you can just
say the same thing.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:90%
This stress, this stress.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So later, when we deal
with a specific issues,

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into a
story a little bit.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> As you just saw, we gathered
a diverse group of participants

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.745 align:middle line:84%
in an intensive tapping
workshop in New York City.

00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll see
sessions featuring

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
four of these
participants, with plenty

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of learning tips along the
way from Carol and myself.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:90%
So let's get started.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And please, tap along
with us at home.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What's a priority for
you to work on, to clear,

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
to bring down so that you
are better around your stress

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:84%
levels, your physiology, and
any kind of eating habits that

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Battling myself.

00:20:32.825 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Battling yourself?

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Myself, yeah.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.415 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:20:37.415 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I originally picked up
Jon's book because I was having

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
issues with my weight.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was a yo-yo effect.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I never was
overweight as a child.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But as I got older,
I started to gain.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.622 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
where it was coming from.

00:20:50.622 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd go up and
down and then up and--

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It would go up in the
winters, down in the summers--

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
as always, trying to drop weight
for the summer, look better.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But then, with my career,
I started noticing

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I needed to be healthier.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.995 align:middle line:84%
I needed to get
this weight off me,

00:21:03.995 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
because they kept putting more
weight on me year to year.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I needed to drop weight,
to become lighter.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I just started noticing
more looking in the mirror

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and not being happy with myself.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, through injury,
through the career,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I would gain, because I
would get lazy and just

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
the stresses of everyday life.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just tired of it.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I know I don't have much,
really, to get rid of anymore.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to be
comfortable with myself.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a single mother.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:90%
I was separated in 2011.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And the father of
my children had

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
been involved with his
children until November

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of this past year,
where he left,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
went to live with another
woman and her children.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's completely not involved
with my children anymore.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So I am completely the only
one taking care of my children

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, physically,
mentally, the whole situation.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
My daughter had a really
tough time, back in January,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and ended up needing
to be hospitalized.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So the stress of
taking care and being

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:84%
the only person
financially and otherwise

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:90%
is really, really big.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm in a very
competitive industry.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:84%
To get into the industry is very
difficult. And once you're in,

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
it's like that hedonic treadmill
of you've never hit the goal.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
There's always a new one
set before you've managed

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:90%
to settle into the first layer.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
aggressive, successful team

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:90%
that I work for.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thrilled
that I'm with them.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, when they
pass on the work to my level,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
it gets a bit condescending
and maybe one person

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
in particular who
you feel like almost

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:90%
like you're being attacked.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:90%
He can zero in.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:84%
He knows what makes
you uncomfortable.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And he uses that to
drive you harder,

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because in his mind, that's
what brings productivity-- fear,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:90%
or just that kind of aggression.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's gotten to the point
I can't eat in the office.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:90%
I can't eat around the team.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I just feel very like somebody
is keeping tabs all the time.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It's so stressful.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been a caregiver
my entire life.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me a feeling
of control and comfort

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:90%
by doing that.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm good at it.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, sometimes,
I find myself

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
being very anxious when
things I can't control happen.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like my
world is falling apart

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%
when that happens.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly
under stress, because I

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:90%
can't control everything.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, more
personally, my mom and I

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
have lived together
for a lot of years.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And she's much older now.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I feel sometimes like I'm so
worried about her that I don't

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
give her a chance to
breathe, because I'm always

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:90%
worried about her health.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
do that to her either.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:90%
So I have all these conflicts.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And anything else
about keeping the weight

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:90%
on as protection, as Jon said?

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.335 align:middle line:90%
What would you say about that?

00:24:37.335 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a lot of trust issues.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Trust issues.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So that makes sense to
you, though, why then you

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.625 align:middle line:84%
would feel the need for
the protection in addition

00:24:45.625 --> 00:24:46.875 align:middle line:90%
to the stress and the anxiety?

00:24:46.875 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure specifically
what, but definitely.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Just tune into that
without the specifics.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I have trust issues
is a specific target,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
because we can tell it
brings up something for you.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So say again, I have
these trust issues.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I have this trust issues.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Zero to 10.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>> 10.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 hundred.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.906 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 hundred.

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:12.706 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just see
if we can get that down

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
with the tapping,
because that is probably

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.622 align:middle line:84%
coursing through your body
as anxiety all the time.

00:25:21.622 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say some
pretty strong statements.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to measure
the truth of them.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I hate myself.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Zero to 10?

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Six.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Six.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:90%
So you live with a six.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:90%
That's horrible, intolerable.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
You hate yourself for your
weight and other things,

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:90%
or just the weight?

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Other things.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Other things.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:49.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to say
anything about those?

00:25:49.935 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> [SIGHS]

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't have to.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:90%
We can do whatever you want.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But that self-hatred,
the self-loathing,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:90%
will keep pounds on forever.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Not doing enough.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You feel like
you don't do enough.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Past or current?

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.783 align:middle line:90%
>> All of the above.

00:26:06.783 --> 00:26:07.616 align:middle line:90%
>> All of the above?

00:26:07.616 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Current.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Current.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So pick an incident or
an area where you think,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not enough.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing enough.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Pick that.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So we target one part,
so it's not too much.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot to choose from.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It just seems like my life,
I tend to take on everything

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.096 align:middle line:90%
in large scales.

00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So more guilt
and responsibility.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:29.122 --> 00:26:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's not have one kid.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's have four.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's not buy a
single family house.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's buy multi-family.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's not join the
fire department

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and go to an easy company.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.782 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the hardest company.

00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.293 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:26:42.293 --> 00:26:45.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably my
past, the childhood.

00:26:45.053 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you know what
feelings it comes from

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.975 align:middle line:90%
in your childhood?

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I can make a guess,
but I don't know for you.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Trying to do more.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Because usually people who do
that, to do the next, the next,

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
is because they
feel so inadequate.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
That's where the--
it's not healthy drive.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It's too much Right?

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's get very clear about
what we're going to measure,

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Think of the past part.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do enough.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't enough.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:90%
See what resonates more.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do enough
or I wasn't enough.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Wasn't enough.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I wasn't enough.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you have an incident or
a decade or a time period?

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Zero to 10, I wasn't enough.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
How high is that
about that incident

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:90%
that you're thinking of?

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Nine.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Nine.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:84%
What else is an issue
for you that blocks you

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:84%
from being able to
release the weight

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
or that keeps you
protecting yourself

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:90%
or that keeps you feeling safe?

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I think I'm lonely.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm all alone in
taking care of my children.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think I felt
lonely in my marriage,

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't
a good marriage.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really feel
more lonely that he's gone.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.437 align:middle line:90%
But I think I feel lonely.

00:28:01.437 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
I was going to say.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:90%
How long have you felt lonely?

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.205 align:middle line:90%
Not since 2011.

00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>> A long time.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.477 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a really long time.

00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:84%
It's been a really long
time feeling lonely.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Say it loud.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I just feel lonely.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I just feel lonely.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Zero to 10.

00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm probably a nine.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Nine.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
As far as the target,
he's pressuring me.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:90%
He's pushing me.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.738 align:middle line:84%
What would be the language
that would really fit you?

00:28:23.738 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds funny, but I feel
like sometimes he scares me.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:90%
He zeros in so much.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.502 align:middle line:90%
And the attacks get so personal.

00:28:35.502 --> 00:28:36.302 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:36.302 --> 00:28:38.388 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:38.388 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:90%
We'll call him your boss.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Is that enough?

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Or just to call him--

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>> He's somebody in the team.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> On the team.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> He's pretty high
up on the teams.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.135 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:44.135 --> 00:28:44.935 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:44.935 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.432 align:middle line:90%
Even though he attacks me.

00:28:47.432 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though he attacks me.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.955 align:middle line:90%
>> And zeros in on me.

00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> He zeros in on me.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.822 align:middle line:90%
>> And it terrifies me.

00:28:51.822 --> 00:28:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And it terrifies me.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> And it feels intrusive.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And it feels intrusive.

00:28:57.055 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:90%

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.472 align:middle line:84%
>> And how I'm
trying to handle it.

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And how I'm
trying to handle it.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though
it's really scary.

00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though
it's really scary.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.503 align:middle line:90%
>> He's so aggressive.

00:29:06.503 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> He's so aggressive.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.715 align:middle line:90%

00:29:08.715 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And he really gets to me.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:90%

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.670 align:middle line:90%

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.335 align:middle line:90%
>> And how I feel about it.

00:29:14.335 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And how I feel about it.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
don't feel any space.

00:29:17.107 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
don't feel any space.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Or any freedom.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Or any freedom.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.357 align:middle line:90%

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> And how upset it makes me.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.835 align:middle line:90%

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:90%

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Leave me alone.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you're smart.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you're smart.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.892 align:middle line:84%
>> But fear is not
working anymore.

00:30:04.892 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But fear is not
working anymore.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.417 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not making
me more productive.

00:30:08.417 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not making
me more productive.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just scaring me.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just scaring me.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can't even eat
in the office anymore.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can't even eat
in the office anymore.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do is
reduce that [INAUDIBLE] daily.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:84%
How many hours a
week are you working?

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Clearly.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So we reduce that
so he doesn't have

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:84%
this overpowering, threatening
sense about him to you.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Does that feel any better,
just saying those words

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and describing it?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.113 align:middle line:84%
>> You had said hovering
to me on the break.

00:30:45.113 --> 00:30:45.950 align:middle line:90%
So I used that word.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:90%
How's it feel to you?

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit more tranquil.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Little more tranquil.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.257 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:30:52.257 --> 00:30:55.456 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:56.738 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.738 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Typically, when you're not
able to deal with your feelings

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
for past or present, there's
a safety issue that comes up.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about this
safety issue a lot.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And I lived through this.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.940 align:middle line:84%
When I was working in New
York, OK, I was stressed out.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.565 align:middle line:84%
And that was causing
me to gain weight.

00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But I was also in a
really, really violent

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:90%
working experience.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a business
partner that was just

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.398 align:middle line:90%
relentlessly angry and violent.

00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And it triggered some
stuff in me as a kid,

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
because I had someone in my
life that was very abusive, very

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.130 align:middle line:90%
big, and very violent.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And so my business partner never
beat me or anything like that.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:90%
But he had all the traits.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Threatening.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Extremely threatening.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was I worked
with this guy for 15 years.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time I
was working with him,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I got heavier and heavier.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I was
putting distance--

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:84%
because we worked in
the same trading desk,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:90%
almost this close.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And he's angry all the time.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting out all
this negative energy.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the weight
was like a buffer

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to that energy and a
buffer to the anger.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I got so
big that I wasn't afraid

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:90%
of him anymore.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
twice his size.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:90%
I could squash him.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Protected.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Protected.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I could sit on
him like a pancake.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.952 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid of him anymore.

00:32:08.952 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:90%
But the weight did that.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:84%
It created this
kind of protection.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.668 align:middle line:84%
>> And for a lot of people,
especially if you've been

00:32:14.668 --> 00:32:15.800 align:middle line:90%
abused as a kid--

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I see this a lot with
women, that weight

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:84%
came on as a result
of that as protection.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a buffer
between me and you.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of you.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I need this.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Two questions I ask that
always reveal something.

00:32:29.538 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:84%
What's the upside to
keeping the weight on?

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And they say, don't be silly.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I've been trying to lose.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I know you have.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:90%
What's the upside?

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And that sometimes leads them
to say I feel safer with it.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:90%
I feel protected.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.890 align:middle line:84%
What's the downside
to losing the weight?

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no downside.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't be silly.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:84%
There must be a
downside, or else you

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.177 align:middle line:90%
would've been able to do it.

00:32:46.177 --> 00:32:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they can get
to, because the last time

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I was there--

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I had someone in your 50s say,
the last time I was at my goal

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.250 align:middle line:90%
weight, I got pregnant.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said, clearly, I'm not
going to get pregnant again.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was perfect, because
it was in a workshop.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
She said, clearly, I have a
connection to getting pregnant

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.758 align:middle line:90%
again, which I don't want to.

00:33:02.758 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said it's not
medically possible.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:90%
But she had an association.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.135 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
have an association

00:33:08.135 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:90%
with being attractive.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.395 align:middle line:90%
>> And attention.

00:33:10.395 --> 00:33:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes
it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.030 align:middle line:90%
because they're in a marriage.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.440 align:middle line:90%
And they want to stay faithful.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And if they get all
of this attention--

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.340 align:middle line:84%
there's all these
underlying issues.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what will
happen when you get there?

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Because again, everyone
runs around saying

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I want to get there.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure you
want to get there?

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you ask them--

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.708 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the exact
same thing we do.

00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you're dealing
with it, feelings

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:84%
around the safety issue, now
what we usually do is we,

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:84%
with visualization, we give
them a way of feeling safe.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Some angel wings wrapped
around them, a column of light,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.415 align:middle line:90%
a surrogate for the weight.

00:33:41.415 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that we can do

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
with tapping where not only
do we get rid of the feelings

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
about feeling unsafe, but
actually make them feel safe?

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.650 align:middle line:90%
How I address it is that--

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.320 align:middle line:84%
so usually this is
connected to abuse.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.170 align:middle line:90%
So they were small.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
They were a child.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were
traumatized or abused.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll say is, you
were how old back then?

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Six.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course you can't do
anything with a 250 pound man

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:90%
when you're six.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And so we address the past.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:90%
I was unsafe back then.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do anything.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.267 align:middle line:90%
He threatened me.

00:34:11.267 --> 00:34:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Now how old are you?

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And the person will say, I'm 42.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Safety is up to them now.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not about being six.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So they start to, instead
of globalize everything--

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to be safe
if I take 40 pounds off.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.357 align:middle line:84%
They start saying, oh, come
to think-- oh, I'm safe now,

00:34:28.357 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:84%
because I'm an adult. But when
you've been abused as a child--

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And you do that
through tapping?

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, through a reversal?

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.201 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Start with the past.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have the past, the
present, and the future.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're afraid to lose
weight in the future because

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:90%
of their past.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:90%
So we start with the past.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I wasn't
safe back then and I

00:34:44.683 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:84%
couldn't protect myself, I'm
afraid it's going to happen

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:47.999 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:34:47.999 --> 00:34:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Picture yourself in the future.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:84%
What would you do
differently now?

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, it would never happen now.

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm an adult, and
I take care of myself.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:90%
So it starts to change.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So they have to do some, with
their thoughts and feelings,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:90%
they have to get back into--

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.248 align:middle line:84%
>> And you find that that's an
effective way of making them

00:35:03.248 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:84%
feel safe and relieving
that initial trauma?

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And also as an adult,
if they're carrying

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
40 to 200 extra
pounds on themselves,

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:90%
they don't feel safe.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, how safe
do you actually feel?

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I still
don't feel safe,

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:90%
even with the extra weight.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Their boss--

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is usually the case.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So we get that feeling in the
present down as far as we can.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Then the weight
has a place to go.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.425 align:middle line:84%
You can't release it if
it's your protection.

00:35:29.425 --> 00:35:30.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:30.225 --> 00:35:32.157 align:middle line:84%
But basically anytime a
safety issue comes up,

00:35:32.157 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:84%
you always look for
it and address it.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And even though I
don't feel safe--

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:36.670 align:middle line:90%
always look for that.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.307 align:middle line:84%
And I would go as far as to say,
if you've had serious weight

00:35:40.307 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:84%
issues your whole
life or if you could

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:84%
target your weight issues
to any specific event,

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:90%
always look for that.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Always look for the
safety issue first.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.653 align:middle line:84%
Try to get as far
down into that issue.

00:35:50.653 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And correct me if I'm wrong.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.742 align:middle line:84%
If you can get to
that safety issue,

00:35:53.742 --> 00:35:55.450 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with
the real issue, then.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get to
it, no matter what you do--

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's our experience.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The weight can't come
off, because it's a survival

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.380 align:middle line:90%
mechanism.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the only
thing humans care about.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, bodies.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Protecting themselves.

00:36:07.012 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The only things our
bodies care about is--

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Is the safety.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Is the safety.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> So we agree so much on that.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We're speaking
the same language.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.212 align:middle line:90%
>> High five.

00:36:15.212 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
these trust issues.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
these trust issues.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know they're
connected to my weight.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.095 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know they're
connected to my weight.

00:36:22.095 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I deeply.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I deeply.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And profoundly.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And profoundly.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Accept myself anyway.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Accept myself anyway.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
these trust issues.

00:36:33.982 --> 00:36:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
these trust issues.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's hard
to accept myself.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's hard
to accept myself.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I choose to accept that
I'm doing the best I can.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I choose to accept that
I'm doing the best I can.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.892 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have
these trust issues.

00:36:52.892 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I have
these trust issues.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> From childhood.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> From childhood.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.337 align:middle line:90%
>> I can feel it.

00:36:57.337 --> 00:36:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I can.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.305 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept who I am.

00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I accept who I am.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And how I feel.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And how I feel.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, just while you
keep tapping there,

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.752 align:middle line:84%
do you want to say
anything else about it?

00:37:09.752 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it seemed like
you were tuning in more.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Totally up to you.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just afraid.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Afraid.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Afraid of what?

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:90%
So go right to the eyebrow.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of what
could come up.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm afraid of
what could come up.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm afraid of
what might come up.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm afraid of
what might come up.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Under the eye.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I have this fear and anxiety.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I have this fear and anxiety.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> About my trust issues.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> About my trust issues.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm worried about
these trust issues.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm worried about
these trust issues.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> My anxiety about
these trust issues.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> My anxiety about
this trust issues.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.360 align:middle line:84%

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So that was a little unusual
about our target statement.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
These trust issues
was kind of broad.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But what came up immediately
was you don't want--

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that scares you, just admitting
that there's trust issues.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where I was talking about
the anxiety with the tapping.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.440 align:middle line:90%
So see if you can go back in.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.755 align:middle line:84%
Just say the phrase, I know
I have these trust issues.

00:38:50.755 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I know I have
these trust issues.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.190 align:middle line:90%
That was a 10 hundred.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.087 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing now?

00:38:56.087 --> 00:38:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still really high.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:90%
But I could say words.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I could see it.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.710 align:middle line:90%
There was shifting there.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the anxiety, I have anxiety
about these trust issues.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I have anxiety about

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.782 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.782 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit less.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.615 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit less.

00:39:14.615 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of what
could come up.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm afraid of
what could come up.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm still afraid of
what could come up.

the right language that really

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%

like a bull's eye to you.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And the highest one
right now, I think,

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.775 align:middle line:84%
is I'm afraid of
what could come up.

00:39:30.775 --> 00:39:31.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:31.575 --> 00:39:32.400 align:middle line:90%

>> I just want to be
clear on this one thing.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm feeling like a
failure, do I say that?

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Even though I feel
like a failure.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.613 align:middle line:84%
Or do I say, even
though I am a failure.

00:39:45.613 --> 00:39:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Because all these things
are so foreign to me,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.390 align:middle line:90%
I never say these things.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.260 align:middle line:90%
So two options.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you feel
like a failure.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you feel
like you've failed.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>> In a project.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:90%
So you think about the project.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, I have that awful feeling.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a failure.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
How does feel like a failure,
how does that make you feel?

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Like a failure.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:02.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:90%
That's not a feeling.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.483 align:middle line:90%
How does it make you feel?

00:40:04.483 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:90%
I feel ashamed.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel ashamed because I
think I failed at that.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a much better statement.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't say generalized
judgment statements

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.668 align:middle line:90%
like I'm a failure.

00:40:15.668 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:90%
You don't say things like that.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that ends
up being a belief.

I believe I failed.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I believe I'm a loser.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You can do that under
the belief category.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
It's always more powerful
to go to the emotion.

00:45:52.562 --> 00:45:54.675 align:middle line:84%
So we know this doesn't
change his behavior.

00:45:54.675 --> 00:45:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But it changes your
reaction to his behavior,

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.870 align:middle line:84%
therefore your stress,
therefore your chemistry,

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and however that comes out for
weight and eating with you.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:03.820 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel to you now?

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It was clearly a 10
in the beginning.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:06.860 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get a second number.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But how are you
doing now, just when

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.723 align:middle line:84%
you picture that aggressive,
intrusive parts about him?

00:46:12.723 --> 00:46:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> More like an eight.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> More like an eight.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything else
coming up about it,

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.600 align:middle line:84%
about him that's a good point
about it makes you feel stupid?

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just it reminds me of
an incident that happened when I

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:90%
was a kid.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And he reminds me so
much of that person

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that it's hard to disassociate
one with the other,

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:40.740 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
completely different roles.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So the memories and the
echoing triggers the old stuff.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.740 align:middle line:84%
The old incident, when
you think of it right now,

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.010 align:middle line:84%
zero to 10, how upset
do you get about it?

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I get really upset.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Really upset.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.495 align:middle line:84%
So even right now, telling
us that he reminds you--

00:47:00.495 --> 00:47:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's gotten to the
point-- it happened when I was,

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:05.612 align:middle line:90%
like, 13 or 14.

00:47:05.612 --> 00:47:07.820 align:middle line:84%
At the office, if you show
that you're uncomfortable,

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.500 align:middle line:90%
he'll attack you more.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.744 align:middle line:84%
So my hands shake under the
desk when he gets really upset.

00:47:13.744 --> 00:47:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I realize when I
notice that, that's what

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I used to do when I was a kid.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:20.310 align:middle line:90%
You keep things a secret.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So you get these weird
habits that, even when

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.400 align:middle line:84%
you're stressed, people
don't pick up on it.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:26.150 align:middle line:90%

Yes or no.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> As a matter of fact,
you would make a statement.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:04.228 align:middle line:84%
And then you would say to the
participants, is that true?

00:56:04.228 --> 00:56:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> How true does it feel?

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> How true does it feel?

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Zero to 10.

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So really you're
trying to target truth.

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.765 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, your truth
about your feelings.

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:11.627 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

00:56:11.627 --> 00:56:15.167 align:middle line:84%
I had a client who was
working with weight loss.

00:56:15.167 --> 00:56:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, what's the truth
about how you feel?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.953 align:middle line:84%
She said, the truth
is I feel disgusting.

00:56:18.953 --> 00:56:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But I can't say it out
loud, because everybody

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.680 align:middle line:90%
says don't be silly.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.990 align:middle line:90%
You're not disgusting.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.260 align:middle line:90%
She felt disgusting.

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So I let her say, even
though I feel disgusting

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.793 align:middle line:90%
and I'm disgusted with myself.

00:56:28.793 --> 00:56:29.960 align:middle line:90%
For her, that was her truth.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And once she was able to say
it and I didn't block it,

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.220 align:middle line:84%
she went, I'm not
that disgusting.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.275 align:middle line:90%
It started to move.

00:56:35.275 --> 00:56:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
example of truth.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And I saw you do the
truth in the reversal, too,

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.428 align:middle line:84%
because when you were
working with John--

00:56:40.428 --> 00:56:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and he was so pent up and
had such feelings about this.

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And then he finally went--

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:47.478 align:middle line:84%
and then you went, maybe
I can accept myself.

00:56:47.478 --> 00:56:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And then you stop for a second.

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:50.200 align:middle line:90%
You go, is that true?

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You're trying to target
the truth is really what.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And by targeting
the truth, you're

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:57.830 align:middle line:84%
able to really get
through to the emotion.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Because otherwise, we're
always seeing a bounce back.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So someone's
doing the happy--

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy and free.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm wonderful.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And the person
doesn't feel that way.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.850 align:middle line:84%
You'll either see this
completely glazed over look

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:08.970 align:middle line:90%
or there's no movement.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You get the connection
about, if you have trust issues,

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.430 align:middle line:84%
you hold on to extra weight,
either out of the biochemistry

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:20.450 align:middle line:84%
that Jon was teaching us about
or out of stress or out of I

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:21.910 align:middle line:84%
don't want anybody
near me anyways.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
angle that we can go to

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.950 align:middle line:90%
with the tapping for you.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:29.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to imagine--
you OK right now?

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:33.400 align:middle line:90%
You just tuned into something.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been thinking
about something.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.300 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.152 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what's going on.

00:57:38.152 --> 00:57:39.585 align:middle line:84%
>> I was thinking
about my father.

00:57:39.585 --> 00:57:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> You were thinking
about your father.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And what about him?

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't trust him.

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't trust him.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.870 align:middle line:90%
And my boyfriend, too.

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't trust
your boyfriend?

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:56.616 align:middle line:90%
>> We broke up.

00:57:56.616 --> 00:57:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people in my life
that I thought I could trust--

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Betrayed you?

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:05.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we want
to do when there's

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:10.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people in your life
who've done the same behavior,

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I want you to focus
on one so we don't

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:84%
get scattered-- and him
and him and this person

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and that person.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to pick either
your boyfriend or your father

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:23.895 align:middle line:84%
right now and that feeling
of not trusting them.

00:58:23.895 --> 00:58:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Is your father still alive?

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So a feeling of not trusting
him or an incident or an event

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:33.000 align:middle line:84%
or with your boyfriend or that
pervasive feeling of, eh, I

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.700 align:middle line:84%
just don't trust, we
have to isolate it.

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.510 align:middle line:90%
That's our target.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to tap on that.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.210 align:middle line:90%
So what would you prefer?

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>> My father.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Your father.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:40.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:43.293 align:middle line:84%
So when you think of your father
now, even though he's passed,

00:58:43.293 --> 00:58:45.480 align:middle line:84%
do you think of
not trusting him?

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Check that charge.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Zero to 10?

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>> 10.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things we know
about childhood trauma is that

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.660 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to blame ourselves
for it than think anything else

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.460 align:middle line:90%
could be going on.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when we blame
ourselves, then guess what?

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:01.070 align:middle line:90%
We could have done something.

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And oddly, there's
something relieving

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:04.753 align:middle line:90%
about saying it's all my fault.

00:59:04.753 --> 00:59:05.920 align:middle line:90%
I could have done something.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.003 align:middle line:90%
I could've been different.

00:59:07.003 --> 00:59:09.060 align:middle line:84%
If only, if only, if
only, believe it or not,

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.590 align:middle line:90%
feels better than, guess what?

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it wasn't all me.

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.785 align:middle line:90%
So it's very confusing to kids.

00:59:14.785 --> 00:59:15.660 align:middle line:90%
And then you grow up.

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:16.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's not dealt with.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And it still feels
that way to you.

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:18.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:18.663 --> 00:59:19.096 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:19.096 --> 00:59:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:21.480 align:middle line:84%
What else could you
say about it to us now?

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.788 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still going on.

00:59:22.788 --> 00:59:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> What's still going on?

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:24.842 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:59:24.842 --> 00:59:25.642 align:middle line:90%
>> The past.

00:59:25.642 --> 00:59:26.892 align:middle line:90%
>> The past is still going on?

00:59:26.892 --> 00:59:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> The trauma from the past.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is it still
going on for you?

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just people
are older now,

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.037 align:middle line:90%
still doing the same things.

00:59:36.037 --> 00:59:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So your family members.

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:37.545 align:middle line:90%
>> My family.

00:59:37.545 --> 00:59:38.345 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:38.345 --> 00:59:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you say anything
more about it?

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.918 align:middle line:84%
Only what you feel
comfortable with.

00:59:43.918 --> 00:59:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm comfortable with it all.

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I just can't get it out.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:46.583 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:47.350 align:middle line:90%
All right, all right.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Eyebrow.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.402 align:middle line:90%
It's still going on.

00:59:49.402 --> 00:59:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still going on.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> The side.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:51.930 align:middle line:90%
It's still going on.

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:53.022 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still going on.

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And I can't take it.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:54.938 align:middle line:90%
>> And I can't take it.

00:59:54.938 --> 00:59:57.315 align:middle line:90%
>> But I can't do anything.

00:59:57.315 --> 00:59:59.632 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't do anything.

00:59:59.632 --> 01:00:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't do anything
when I was too young.

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't do anything
when I was too young.

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And I can't do anything now.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't do anything now.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe it wasn't my
fault when I was young.

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it wasn't my
fault when I was young.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to save them.

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to save them.

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't save
anybody back then.

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't save anybody.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't do enough.

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't do enough.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.775 align:middle line:84%
>> And I still
feel that way now.

01:00:19.775 --> 01:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And I still
feel that way now.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still going on.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still going on.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I still feel traumatized.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I still feel traumatized.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.532 align:middle line:90%
>> I still feel the pain.

01:00:28.532 --> 01:00:29.573 align:middle line:90%
>> I still feel the pain.

01:00:29.573 --> 01:00:30.998 align:middle line:84%

could, there are two options.

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%

And he said, you know what?

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I have done enough.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
The problem with doing it too
quickly, the flip to, quote,

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
"positive statements," or
maybe I could forgive myself,

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
it's a possibility
that I could consider

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.150 align:middle line:84%
forgiving myself and
letting myself off the hook.

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:53.652 align:middle line:84%
If you do that too soon,
the person pushes back.

01:05:53.652 --> 01:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing
it on yourself,

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
you will push back and
say, please, that's--

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
please.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you want
to do a couple of rounds

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.130 align:middle line:90%
on the target--

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
the issue, the anger, the
hurt, the guilt, the craving,

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%
the feeling out of control.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Do a couple of rounds first.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Then you can start to
introduce something

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
more positive or something
more cognitively digestible

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.600 align:middle line:90%
for them.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.642 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

01:06:16.642 --> 01:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I did do the best I could
when I was eight years old.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So with the flip or reversal or
whatever you want to call it,

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
you can't really
go wrong with that.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if you do it
and it doesn't sit with you,

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.650 align:middle line:90%
it'll bounce back.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:31.042 align:middle line:84%
So you want to try the
reversal at different times

01:06:31.042 --> 01:06:32.250 align:middle line:90%
until it doesn't bounce back.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.083 align:middle line:84%
And once it doesn't
bounce back, then you're

01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:35.310 align:middle line:90%
making some real progress.

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it to talk
about the old incident?

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I hate it.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You hate it.

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:40.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> You hate it.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I waited so long to tell anyone.

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:51.083 align:middle line:90%


01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You waited so long
to tell anyone.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But they said it was my fault
and that it was too late to do

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.180 align:middle line:90%
anything.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And they just didn't believe me.

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:02.126 align:middle line:84%
So I hate talking
about it, because it

01:07:02.126 --> 01:07:03.220 align:middle line:90%
doesn't change anything.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:05.000 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And then that resistance
to ever talking about it

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and never getting it
validated gets trapped.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.370 align:middle line:90%
There was an experience.

01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:16.078 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, why
would I talk about it?

01:07:16.078 --> 01:07:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I was blamed.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Did you believe them when
they said it was your fault?

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:24.442 align:middle line:84%
Is there a part of you
that thought maybe?

01:07:24.442 --> 01:07:25.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.650 align:middle line:90%
I want you to test that, OK?

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:30.700 align:middle line:90%
It was my fault.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It was my fault.

01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> How true does it feel?

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:36.315 align:middle line:84%
How upsetting does that
feel as a yes for you?

01:07:36.315 --> 01:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what I kind of made
peace with and closed it off

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:39.880 align:middle line:90%
with.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.396 align:middle line:84%
>> That it's your
fault. All right.

01:07:42.396 --> 01:07:43.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm convinced
it was my fault.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I'm
convinced it was my fault.

01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a part of
me that isn't sure.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a part of
me that isn't sure.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And that triggers
a lot of feelings.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And that triggers
a lot of feelings.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
waited a long time.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
waited a long time.

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I
finally told someone.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I
finally told someone.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> They said it was my fault.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> They said it was my fault.

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I
won't talk about it.

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.608 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder I
won't talk about it.

01:08:07.608 --> 01:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I see that it's connected
to my situation now.

01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I see that it's connected
to my situation now.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.609 align:middle line:90%
>> And part of that's relieving.

01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:17.763 align:middle line:90%
Part of that's relieving.

01:08:17.763 --> 01:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Part of that's relieving.

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:21.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm going
to unpack both of them.

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm going
to unpack both of them.

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:25.328 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm going to take
the sting out of both.

01:08:25.328 --> 01:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to take
the sting out of both.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> This is not my fault.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> This is not my fault.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe it is.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe it is.

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not my fault.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not my fault.

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> But they said it was.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> But they said it was.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.071 align:middle line:90%
>> So what if it is my fault?

01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:41.279 align:middle line:90%
>> So what if it is my fault?

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:43.017 align:middle line:90%
>> What if it isn't?

01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> What if it isn't?

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.425 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've spent all
these years blaming myself.

01:08:46.425 --> 01:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've spent all
these years blaming myself.

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:50.649 align:middle line:90%

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand why
I didn't tell anyone.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand why
I didn't tell anyone.

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:57.529 align:middle line:90%
>> It was too scary.

01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:58.939 align:middle line:90%
>> It was too scary.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And too threatening.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> He was a big deal.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.319 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a big deal?

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:03.990 align:middle line:90%

>> He was a big deal.

01:09:04.865 --> 01:09:06.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.819 align:middle line:90%

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:09.819 align:middle line:90%
>> He was a big deal.

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't tell anyone.

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:12.359 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't tell anyone.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:13.859 align:middle line:84%

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%

I'm uncomfortable.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.700 align:middle line:90%

>> And my hands shake.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Which makes me
feel vulnerable.

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:39.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Which makes me
feel vulnerable.

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:40.439 align:middle line:90%
>> And weak.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:41.239 align:middle line:90%
>> And weak.

01:09:41.239 --> 01:09:42.779 align:middle line:90%

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And he picks it up.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I hate the cycle.

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I hate the cycle.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.904 align:middle line:84%
>> But I feel a
little different.

01:09:48.904 --> 01:09:50.279 align:middle line:84%
>> But I feel a
little different.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>> He's not changing.

>> He's not changing.

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> But I might.

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> But I might.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> And I am smart.

01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And I am smart.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.062 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm doing a lot.

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm doing a lot.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.812 align:middle line:90%
>> And I know what I'm doing.

01:10:02.812 --> 01:10:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And I know what I'm doing.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I know what I'm doing.

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I know what I'm doing.

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> So leave me alone.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So leave me alone.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is how we straddle
a past incident with a current.

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The current is totally
triggering her.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to get
both of them down,

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
or else they just keep
seesawing back and forth.

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So the old incident
that feels so terrible,

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.460 align:middle line:90%
how are you doing on it now?

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
You've told us about
what it felt like.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you told someone
finally, a while later,

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.930 align:middle line:90%
and they blamed you.

little bit about cravings.

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:54.803 align:middle line:84%
Typically with
tapping, when someone

01:13:54.803 --> 01:13:56.470 align:middle line:84%
goes to tapping for
weight loss, they're

01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.803 align:middle line:84%
always talking about cravings
and behavior modification.

01:13:58.803 --> 01:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Even though I want

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and completely
accept myself.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think we really
demonstrated this morning

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.240 align:middle line:90%
that that's not the real issues.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
But everybody talks about that.

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:10.203 align:middle line:90%
And that's all they think about.

01:14:10.203 --> 01:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, is
there a place for that

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
in weight loss and the
behavior modification

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.985 align:middle line:90%
and the fighting the cravings?

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there a place for that, even
though it's not the real issues

01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:19.720 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with?

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you work on that capacity?

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
If so, how would we
do something like.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when people come
to me for weight loss,

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
they've tried everything.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
They're exhausted
and they're ashamed.

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So when I show
them the chocolate,

01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
we tap on their craving.

01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And their craving
starts to go down.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:36.953 align:middle line:90%
They say, this is different.

01:14:36.953 --> 01:14:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I work.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.428 align:middle line:84%
When I first worked
with clients,

01:14:39.428 --> 01:14:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.280 align:middle line:90%
So I would just do cravings.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens when the
craving gets low enough,

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:46.810 align:middle line:90%
the stress comes up.

01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.680 align:middle line:90%
The fear comes up.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman say to me,
oh, it's not about the donuts

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:51.190 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.077 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

01:14:52.077 --> 01:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And something about her
father started to come up.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the craving feels
like it's physiological only,

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
but we know, and as
you were describing,

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:01.832 align:middle line:90%
it comes from stress.

01:15:01.832 --> 01:15:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really interesting.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying is
when you first started,

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
you used the cravings
as a doorway.

01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't even know that
it was going to be a doorway.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
discovered that there's

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
so many more issues
to weight loss

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and to weight than
just the cravings.

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good way that you
talk about, hey, the craving's

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:17.830 align:middle line:90%
on, but something else.

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Because cravings are so intense
and they really feel out

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
of control, they can't make the
connection that it's stress,

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.610 align:middle line:90%
anger, hurt, childhood issues.

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
They can't make the connection
because the craving feels out

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
of control at the
time and so intense.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:34.957 align:middle line:84%
So when we can get
that down, then they

01:15:34.957 --> 01:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
can start to look
at the other pieces.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.265 align:middle line:84%
It's like when
you're screaming mad,

01:15:38.265 --> 01:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
make a good choice.

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like when you're doing
a tapping sequence and something

01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:42.483 align:middle line:90%
else is jumping out.

01:15:42.483 --> 01:15:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And you can't focus.

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.423 align:middle line:84%
So this lady that
comes to you, she

01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to talk about
her childhood or the fact

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.632 align:middle line:84%
that her father didn't
love her, whatever it was.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And the cravings are
all she can focus on.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So you use tapping
for cravings as a way

01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to get under that and into
some of the real issues.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, talking to them about
how the cravings feel real,

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.167 align:middle line:90%
but they're just a distraction.

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:06.250 align:middle line:90%
And people say no, no, no.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's real.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I know it's real.

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I've had them.

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I know what it feels like.

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But if the craving weren't going
on right now, what do you think

01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:14.110 align:middle line:90%
might come up?

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.613 align:middle line:90%
And they go, how did you know?

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know anything.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I just met you.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And they say yes.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I've got an issue
that I'm dealing with

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:21.912 align:middle line:84%
or that I don't want to
deal with, because that's

01:16:21.912 --> 01:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
what we kept saying this
morning is, remember,

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.860 align:middle line:90%
we understand that food works.

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It works to temporarily
squash the feelings.

01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
If that's your goal
because it's too painful,

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that's how you put on one pound,
two pound, 100 pounds, 200.

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:36.017 align:middle line:90%
That's how you do it.

01:16:36.017 --> 01:16:39.426 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:16:39.426 --> 01:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%


01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.300 align:middle line:90%
So there's one story.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.758 align:middle line:84%
I worked with someone in the
very beginning on weight loss.

01:16:44.758 --> 01:16:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And she had tried everything.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis, pills, every
diet in the world.

01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And she grew up in a
family where there were

01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:53.675 align:middle line:90%
padlocks on the refrigerator.

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm famililar with that.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And the pantry, all that.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And she and all of her
sisters had a weight problem.

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And they had since
they were children.

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:01.893 align:middle line:84%
And when we started
doing the tapping,

01:17:01.893 --> 01:17:03.280 align:middle line:90%
we started on cravings.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But we moved into the
stress of her life,

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
the stress with her elderly
parents and her siblings

01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:10.033 align:middle line:84%
and her children
and a new husband,

01:17:10.033 --> 01:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because they had a
step-combined family.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And she kept saying,
why am I keeping

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.210 align:middle line:90%
the weight off this time?

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:17.070 align:middle line:90%
What's different?

01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that point, I
didn't say much about tapping.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I just said it's a
stress relief technique.

01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's just do it.

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do a whole lot
of background explanation.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And she was thrilled because
she felt not so crazy anymore,

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:30.060 align:middle line:90%
because she was in control.

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
She ate when she was
hungry, basically,

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and didn't chase food all
around the way she had.

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:37.145 align:middle line:90%
A key for her was deprivation.

01:17:37.145 --> 01:17:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So that thing about--

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the padlocks.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:39.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm very familiar
with that situation.

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a common situation.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And it just causes a
lifetime of deprivation.

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And the rebellion.

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> And rebellion.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that you were able
to deal with it by just going

01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper
into the stress

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
by working through the tapping.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But when the client comes
back week after week and says

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.922 align:middle line:84%
I'm different and I'm
doing things differently,

01:18:01.922 --> 01:18:02.880 align:middle line:90%
that's when you listen.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.103 align:middle line:84%
That's when, as a
psychotherapist,

01:18:05.103 --> 01:18:07.770 align:middle line:84%
you wake up and say, something's
going on here that's different.

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.937 align:middle line:84%
Because I was very skeptical
in the beginning, too--

01:18:09.937 --> 01:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
what is this silly
tapping on acupunc--

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.960 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I had to be trained in
it and then try it myself

01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to get my own examples
and my own results

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.743 align:middle line:84%
with clients as
well as with myself.

01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> The examples are amazing.

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:22.700 align:middle line:90%
They really are.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When you think of taking
care of your mother and you feel

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.330 align:middle line:90%
helpless, how high, zero to 10?

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> 10.

01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> 10.

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:29.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:31.972 align:middle line:84%
When you think of your brother
and trying to take care of him

01:18:31.972 --> 01:18:34.070 align:middle line:90%
now, how high?

01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:35.117 align:middle line:90%
It can be the same.

01:18:35.117 --> 01:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
make sure there's--

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's about a 10.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:37.986 align:middle line:90%
>> 10.

01:18:37.986 --> 01:18:38.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:38.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So you have two 10's
in your adult life.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure
there's more, right?

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Living together, too.

01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> They're living together?

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Karate chop.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Even though I feel helpless now.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
feel helpless now.

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:50.697 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't fix them.

01:18:50.697 --> 01:18:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't fix them.

01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't take care of them.

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't take care.

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And I feel guilty.

01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Guilty as well as helpless.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And helpless.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.635 align:middle line:90%
I deeply and profoundly.

01:19:04.635 --> 01:19:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I deeply and profoundly.

01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Accept.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Accept.

01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That I'm in a better place.

01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That I'm in a better place.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm healthier.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:11.705 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm healthier.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes
I don't like that.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Heh.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:15.017 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I don't like that.

01:19:15.017 --> 01:19:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel guilty.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.300 align:middle line:90%

01:19:19.592 --> 01:19:20.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though I feel helpless.

01:19:20.883 --> 01:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That I'm not
helping them more.

>> That I'm not
helping them more.

01:19:23.817 --> 01:19:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That I can't do it.

>> I don't know what it takes.

01:19:26.315 --> 01:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know what it takes.

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%

>> About taking care of them.

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%

myself compassion?

>> What if I gave
myself compassion?

how strong I truly am?

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.010 align:middle line:90%

01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.900 align:middle line:90%

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%

than I thought.

than I though.

01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:07.322 align:middle line:84%
>> But I've been
carrying a big burden.

01:20:07.322 --> 01:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been carrying
a big burden.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.863 align:middle line:90%
>> And I need some relief.

01:20:09.863 --> 01:20:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I need some relief.

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.150 align:middle line:90%

>> A little self-forgiveness.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> A little self-love.

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> A little self-love.

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:19.965 align:middle line:84%

hard on myself.

hard on myself.

01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm OK with all
the feelings I have.

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm OK with all
the feelings I have.

01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:32.255 align:middle line:90%

01:20:32.255 --> 01:20:33.350 align:middle line:90%

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course I am angry.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course I am angry.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I had to step in.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I had to step in.

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.555 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not fair.

01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not fair.

01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:42.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Why didn't he protect us?

01:20:42.547 --> 01:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Why didn't he protect us?

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.707 align:middle line:84%

to be the protector?

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did I have
to be the protector?

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> All this anger at my father.

01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> All this anger at my father.

01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:52.818 align:middle line:84%

around for half a century.

around for half a century.

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:56.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of my space.

01:20:56.222 --> 01:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of me space.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of my face.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of my face.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I am enough.

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I am enough.

01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:03.442 align:middle line:84%

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I am enough,
whatever I'm doing.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm doing a great job.

01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm doing a great job.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:09.382 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're lucky to
have me on the team.

01:21:09.382 --> 01:21:10.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're lucky to
have me on the team.

01:21:13.090 --> 01:21:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So don't ruin it.

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So don't ruin it.

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of my face.

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Get out of my face.

01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> My job is me.

01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> My job is me.

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And my family.

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And my family.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love my family.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love my family.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to
be with my family.

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to
be with my family.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't want to
give any more energy.

01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to
give any more energy.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.605 align:middle line:84%
>> To people who
don't want to change.

01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:32.775 align:middle line:84%
>> To people who
don't want to change.

01:21:32.775 --> 01:21:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it doesn't work.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it doesn't work.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm exhausted.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm exhausted.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would say
homework for you,

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:42.703 align:middle line:84%
any remaining anger about
it, you got it down so far,

01:21:42.703 --> 01:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
you were like, well,
I don't feel angry.

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel kind of sorry
for him, right?

01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Any remaining stuff
on the loneliness?

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Totally tappable issue, any of
those issues that we discussed.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But if there's anything
left sticky on the betrayal,

01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
keep doing it
until it bores you,

01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
until the topic is like,
please, that is in the past.

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So where is that now,
the feelings of betrayal?

01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Low.

01:22:06.190 --> 01:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Low.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:07.807 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:22:07.807 --> 01:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You may not feel the
need to go there.

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:10.560 align:middle line:90%
But that would be up to you.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.643 align:middle line:90%
So that would be homework.

01:22:11.643 --> 01:22:13.170 align:middle line:90%
So that's the direction.

01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Pick the feeling.

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Pick the frustration,
the betrayal,

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and tap on that
until they're so low,

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.645 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to get your attention.

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And usually three, two,
or one is pretty hard

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.116 align:middle line:90%
to get your attention.

01:22:25.116 --> 01:22:26.850 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Jackie.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.447 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the old incident.

01:22:30.447 --> 01:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it still a five, the
upset when you think of it?

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Not really.

01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>> What's it feel like?

01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It just feels like
it's in the past.

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Like it just happened
and it just is.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:46.417 align:middle line:90%
>> It's such a relief.

01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:47.217 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:48.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:22:48.017 --> 01:22:48.817 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:22:48.817 --> 01:22:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I would think so.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And watch for your
hands shaking,

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.088 align:middle line:84%
because he's not going to
have the same effect on you,

01:22:56.088 --> 01:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
because we dropped the old one.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.228 align:middle line:84%
So he's not going to
have the same effect.

01:22:59.228 --> 01:23:00.270 align:middle line:90%
You might shake a little.

01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
You might not at all and
go, wow, it's not happening.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But look for
physiological changes

01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:08.852 align:middle line:84%
where you feel more in command,
more safe, and more yourself.

01:23:08.852 --> 01:23:09.810 align:middle line:90%
They're lucky to have--

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
I never met you.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know they're
lucky to have you.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.750 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit.

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:16.365 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit.

01:23:16.365 --> 01:23:17.165 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:23:17.165 --> 01:23:19.116 align:middle line:90%
We'll work on that later.

01:23:19.116 --> 01:23:21.080 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE],, thank
you very, very much.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really,
really important.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.223 align:middle line:84%
How are you doing
overall emotionally?

01:23:25.223 --> 01:23:27.327 align:middle line:84%
We've done some
pretty big issues.

01:23:27.327 --> 01:23:28.127 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

01:23:28.127 --> 01:23:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:31.290 align:middle line:90%
I feel a little calmer.

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> A little calmer, good.

01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Much calmer.

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:35.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel angry at my father.

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.627 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't feel any anger?

01:23:36.627 --> 01:23:37.427 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:23:37.427 --> 01:23:38.672 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's test you, OK?

01:23:38.672 --> 01:23:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm angry at my father.

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm angry at my father.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And I should be.

01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And I should be.

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- I
don't have anger.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.650 align:middle line:90%
That looks like a zero to me.

01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not even angry at him.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I feel sorry for him.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel sorry for him.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he missed
out on so much.

01:23:54.990 --> 01:24:02.220 align:middle line:90%


01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how to go
take care of myself.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.930 align:middle line:90%
But I think I can try.

01:24:06.930 --> 01:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we can't possibly do it
if the guilt is a eight, nine,

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:10.740 align:middle line:90%
or 10.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.680 align:middle line:90%
We just simply won't do it.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.480 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to go back and
test the first thing we did,

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.332 align:middle line:90%
the trust issues.

01:24:17.332 --> 01:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll just see what kind
of a zing in your body

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:20.290 align:middle line:90%
you get for that.

01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:21.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I have these trust issues.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I have these trust issues.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.380 align:middle line:90%


01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.236 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

01:24:30.236 --> 01:24:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:31.480 align:middle line:90%
I could see.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Did you see her face?

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Did you see the difference?

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:35.540 align:middle line:90%
You're almost looking for it.

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I did?

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I was looking to see if
I had a jump inside or not.

01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:41.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:44.230 align:middle line:90%


01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:45.730 align:middle line:90%
I have to think about that.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:49.060 align:middle line:90%


01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.040 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like there's
been enough relief that you--

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> You do?

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Just that I was
able to get it out.

01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It has been pent up.

01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's just been overwhelming.

01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to re-emphasize
a point that we've talked about

01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:08.880 align:middle line:90%
a number of times.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
We're making a DVD here on
tapping for weight loss.

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice, we haven't
talked about cravings.

[LAUGHS]

01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:20.818 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talking about
behavior modification,

01:25:20.818 --> 01:25:22.860 align:middle line:84%
what to do when you're
walking past a donut shop.

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked about
any of that stuff.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
You focus on exactly what you're
doing right now, releasing

01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
these intense, powerful
emotions that are causing all

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.235 align:middle line:90%
this chemistry in your body.

01:25:35.235 --> 01:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And you are never going to have
to count another calorie again.

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.943 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have
to worry about a craving.

01:25:39.943 --> 01:25:42.640 align:middle line:84%
This is dealing with
the real issues.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And it all goes away.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Time to take care of me.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Really powerful,
really powerful work.

01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.124 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm giving a hug.

01:25:54.124 --> 01:25:56.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Before the tapping session,
I was full of stress and anger.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I was feeling extremely
anxious and panicked.

01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Tight.

01:26:05.130 --> 01:26:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I just felt very tight.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I just felt on edge and like
there was a lot of stuff about

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.590 align:middle line:90%
to spill over.

01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Really right before Carol
started asking me questions,

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very nervous.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I almost talked myself
out of coming today,

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
because I think I
had, in my head,

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
created that this was going
to be some voodoo woo-woo.

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And the fear of
coming was about, oh,

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
because somebody
might see me cry.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad that I did,
because I got to see me crying.

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, I'm feeling much
more at ease and much calmer.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The emotions that I wasn't
expecting to well up were moved

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.020 align:middle line:90%
and released.

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect it.

01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
And that was a breakthrough.

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:48.485 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel a lot
better about myself.

01:26:48.485 --> 01:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I was going
to talk about the things

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:51.420 align:middle line:90%
I talked about.

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel much calmer.

01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I feel I have a
way to lose weight.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Tapping is easier
than you think.

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an immediate
relief than you would think.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a sense of hope and
that there's possibilities.

01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that
I've released things.

01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Things came up I had no idea of.

01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like they're gone.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so different from
anything that I've certainly

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:21.520 align:middle line:90%
come into contact with before.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Here, touch these special
places on your face.

01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:25.030 align:middle line:90%
And it'll make a difference.

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.830 align:middle line:90%
That's strange.

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think at the end, you're
like, oh, well, it works.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.810 align:middle line:90%
That's surprising.

01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> For someone who thinks
tapping is not for them,

01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:34.500 align:middle line:90%
it does look weird.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It definitely seems strange.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But the effects that you
get from it, the feelings

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that you get from it,
the release of some

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of the stresses you have inside
you are definitely profound.

01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:51.295 align:middle line:84%
You might want to get over
the feeling of feeling

01:27:51.295 --> 01:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
silly doing it,
because it's definitely

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.070 align:middle line:90%
something that works.

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If I met somebody who
was skeptical about tapping,

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, if you don't feel
better, I'll buy you a drink.

01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you do feel
better, you buy me one.

01:28:01.230 --> 01:28:02.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And now I feel I'm going to
have a huge opportunity to be

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
fit and trim, because I'm not
going to be carrying around all

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:12.300 align:middle line:90%
the this anxiety and stress.

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have the tools to be able
to do this when I do encounter

01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:18.090 align:middle line:90%
something that's stressful.

01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> At the very
least, it's calming.

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And at its best, it's
a tool that you'll

01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:28.800 align:middle line:84%
have for the rest of your life
that you need less than 15

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.810 align:middle line:90%
minutes to pick up.

01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I do see tapping being
a definite useful tool

01:28:33.150 --> 01:28:37.445 align:middle line:84%
for the future just in the
benefits that I got so quickly.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:41.322 align:middle line:84%
>> I will definitely apply
tapping in the future.

01:28:41.322 --> 01:28:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> This workshop has been
more than I could have ever

01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:44.330 align:middle line:90%
expected.

01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It has been beyond
any expectation

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.370 align:middle line:90%
and a wonderful experience.

01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I really do feel
that there is hope,

01:28:53.120 --> 01:29:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that I have a tool that I can
manage my stress and anxiety.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going to
be amazing to tap into it,

01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:04.820 align:middle line:90%
no pun intended.

01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:06.020 align:middle line:90%
