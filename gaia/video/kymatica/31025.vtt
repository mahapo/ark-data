00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Evolution is a term to
define only one organism,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.695 align:middle line:90%
and that's the self.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.440 align:middle line:90%
The self is the universe.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.776 align:middle line:84%
The self is the alpha and
omega, God, and infinity.

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
thing that evolves

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
part of the self.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Nothing goes through an
evolutionary process alone

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.655 align:middle line:84%
or without direct
benefit to the whole.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
think that there's

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
this controlling
elite, this controlling

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
hand behind the curtains leading
the planet to destruction,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
when you think the end is near,
the apocalypse, Armageddon,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and when you think we
as a species are doomed,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
it is not a they, it is you
that brought this about.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:90%
And for a very good reason.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:90%
You are evolving.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Stop blaming everybody
and everything else.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Quit panicking about global
tyranny and natural disaster

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and pay attention.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.595 align:middle line:84%
Because the world is
telling you something,

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is telling you exactly
what is wrong with you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:90%
and how to fix it.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>The Earth is believed to have
formed 4.6 billion years ago.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Within the first
150 million years,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
it began cooling
and releasing gases

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
from the lithosphere,
which created the earliest

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
forms of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the creation
of this atmosphere,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.595 align:middle line:84%
the sun's ultraviolet
radiation made

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:90%
for uninhabitable conditions.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But as the Earth
cooled further, water

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:84%
condensed in the atmosphere
and oxygen accumulated,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
making way for
organic compounds.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
This spawned single-celled
organisms and then plant life.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And down through time, the
evolutionary chain continued.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we arrive at a species
that does not seem to fit

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:90%
as well as the rest.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens' gestation
period of nine months

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
mimics the 3.8 billion year
evolution of all life on earth.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
The human embryo repeats the
evolution of all species.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
When the sperm and egg
unite, this new creation

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:90%
is a single-celled organism.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Within hours, the single
cell divides and multiplies

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
more rapidly than
any other species.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Four weeks later, the embryo
begins to develop gills,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:90%
mimicking aquatic life.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks later, it
develops lungs and a tail

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:90%
with reptilian appearance.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
From there, a mammal is
recognizable, and then

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:90%
onto a primate form.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It then sheds its lanugo,
which is the embryonic fur,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and at last shows
the characteristics

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:90%
of a human child.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
The human body is a community
of approximately 50 trillion

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything the body does
the cell does as well.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Cells have respiratory
and excretory systems.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
They feed, feel, think, and
communicate with other cells.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Trillions of cells make
up a single organism

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
called the human body, and
billions of human bodies

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
help make up the
organism we call Earth.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has more similarities
with the human anatomy

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:90%
than you may think.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Earth has its own
electromagnetic generation,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:90%
just like the human body.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Research has found that a
direct current of electricity

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
flows through
perineural cells found

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:90%
around every nerve in the body.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:84%
These pathways are
called energy meridians

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and have been used in the
practice of acupuncture

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:90%
for at least 2,000 years.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Dating even farther back is
the notion of dragon paths,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
or lay lines, in which many
megalithic structures and stone

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
monuments were erected,
marking the energy

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:90%
meridians of the Earth.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
These energy meridians
are generated

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
by the resonant frequencies of
the Earth called the Schumann

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:10%
Each planetary body has its
own resonant frequencies

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:10%
and is determined by the
circumference and diameter, as

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:10%
well as the speed of
orbit and rotation.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:10%
The Earth's resonant
frequency starts at 7.83 hertz

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:10%
and ends with the seventh
harmonic at 43.2 hertz,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:10%
correlating with
the seven chakras.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the greatest
discovery of our Earth

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:90%
is its consciousness.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
A visible attribute
of consciousness

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is an energetic
field that governs

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
the shaping of organisms.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Morphic genesis is
a scientific term

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to explain this very
shaping of tissues, organs,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
and entire organisms.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is the creative
force of the entire universe.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It has been given many names
such as God, Yahweh, Krishna,

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:90%
nature, the field, and divinity.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The entire universe is in
fact a single living conscious

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
organism with complete
awareness of itself.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The reason why it may seem
difficult to comprehend this

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
is because our
understanding is typically

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
limited by our language.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
When we hear the term
conscious organism,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
we tend to anthropomorphize
its definition.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
By giving it human
qualities, we mistakenly

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
look past what an organism
truly is in the first place.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The definition of an
organism is any living thing

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:84%
capable of response to
stimuli, reproduction, growth

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and development, and
maintenance of homeostasis

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:90%
as a stable whole.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Our universe does
all of these things.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
of our universe

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for
the form and purpose

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:90%
that all matter assumes.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's resonant frequencies
are a result of its form.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
These frequencies
are responsible

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
for biological rhythms, such as
menstrual and circadian cycles,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as behavioral
and emotional patterns.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies
are then picked up

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
by the flora and fauna, which
are biological instruments that

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:90%
respond to the wave patterns.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
The wave patterns resonate
in the cranial structure

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of our head and converge in
the center of our brain, which

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is where we find
the pineal gland.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is
believed in many cultures

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:84%
to be the spiritual third eye
responsible for intuition.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Descartes called it
the seat of the soul

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:90%
where mind and body meet.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Each individual cell
in our body receives

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic impulse from
our central nervous system.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
They receive the
very same impulse

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that was disseminated to
every biological instrument

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
An explanation of our
conscious universe

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
has been attempted by religion,
science, and philosophy.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The neglect of biological
nature from any organism

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
causes illness.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
A divorce from nature,
exile from Eden,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
confounding with
tongues, they're

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
all symptoms, not of a
biblical God or deity,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:90%
but the true self.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
The greatest and only
threat to ourselves

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is a loss of self, the
death of our divinity.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:10%
As we barrel through history
with oceans of information, yet

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:10%
barely a drop of wisdom,
we have to understand

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.745 align:middle line:10%
how we lost our self.

00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:30.756 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:10%
In sacred texts and
ancient scriptures

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:10%
left by our ancestors, we
find an incredible link

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:10%
between stories of
creation, a great flood,

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:10%
the War of the Gods,
the messiah dying

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:10%
for the sins of man,
end time prophecies,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:10%
and similar characters.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:10%
These correlations
show up in myths

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:10%
from cultures that supposedly
had no contact with one

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:10%
another due to distance
and geography and time.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The common thread we find
that connects all of mythology

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:90%
has its roots in the stars.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
revealing accounts

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is the Battle of the Gods in
heaven and the ensuing flood.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, Lucifer
rivaled the Lord,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and was defeated and
cast down to Earth.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:84%
In the creation myth
of the Enuma Elish,

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
we find a similar story of
Tiamat being defeated by Marduk

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and cast down to
the Abyss of Apsu.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
"And chaos, Tiamat, the
mother of them both.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Apsu and Tiamat's waters
were mingled together."

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that the
chaotic waters of Tiamat

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:84%
were somehow mixed with
the sweet waters of Apsu.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Apsu was the Sumero-Akkadian god
of the abyss beneath the earth.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Tiamat, also known
as Lucifer, was

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
known as a serpent or dragon,
and was defeated by Marduk.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:10%
Marduk was the father
of Nabu, or Mercury.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:10%
And Mercury is the same
mythological character

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:10%
as the Zoroastrian Mithra,
the Egyptian Hermes Anubis,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:10%
and the not the
[? Nasikermes ?] [? Christos ?].

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The most recent
version of Mercury,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
however, is the
archangel Michael

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, who defeated
Lucifer and sent them

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
to the abyss of
the earth, or hell.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
This story is steeped in
astrological significance

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible and in many
other ancient scriptures.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
This leads to an
event in history

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that is recorded by many
researchers regarding

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic upheaval
and historic deluge.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
William Comyns Beaumont
states, "The flood immortalizes

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the collision of
a fallen planet,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
later termed Satan, actually a
cometary body, with our earth."

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Consider what this reveals.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
He postulates that a
planet, later termed Satan,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
fell to the Earth, creating
the flood we see recorded

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible and other myths.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer, or Tiamat, was a
planet known to ancient cultures

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
as The Glistening One, the
Dragon of Chaotic Salt Waters.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The light from the
sun illuminated

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:84%
this planet's
water, which gave it

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.130 align:middle line:84%
a glow that rivaled the
sun's own light, which

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
is where we hear
about Lucifer rivaling

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
the Lord, the Lord in this case
being the sun, which sustains

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and gives warmth to the Earth.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The planet Tiamat,
or Lucifer, was

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
destroyed by a
cataclysmic event that

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
pulled the watery planet
to the abyss of the earth.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of
Enoch, it reveals,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
"And behold a star
fell from heaven--

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and when it fell to Earth, I saw
how the Earth was swallowed up

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
in a great abyss."

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:10%
The myth of the Ute
Indians states, "The sun

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:10%
was shivered into a
thousand fragments, which

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:10%
fell to Earth causing a
general conflagration.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Then TA-WATS, fled before the
destruction he had wrought,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:10%
and as he fled, the burning
Earth consumed his feet, legs,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:10%
body, hands, and arms, until
at last, swarmed with heat,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:10%
the eyes of the
god burst and tears

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:10%
gushed forth in a flood
which spread over the Earth,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:10%
extinguishing the fire."

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
This myth resembles the
translation of the Enuma Elish

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
by Stephanie Daley in her
book, "Myth from Mesopotamia,"

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:84%
which explains that
"Tiamat's eyes became

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the source of the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers."

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
As written in the
Book of Revelations,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:90%
"And there was a war in heaven.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Michael and his angels
fought against the dragon,

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and the dragon and his
angels fought back.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
The great dragon
was hurled down,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:84%
that ancient serpent called
the devil, or Satan, who

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:90%
leads the whole world astray.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:90%
He was hurled to the earth."

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The Roman mythology of
Ovid gives the story

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of Phaeton, which happens
to be another name given

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to the watery planet
Lucifer, or Tiamat.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
This story reveals that
Phaeton was a child of the sun

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and wished to become
the sun for a day.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Phaeton attempted this feat,
and eventually, [? Jove, ?]

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
who was also known as
Marduk, destroyed Phaeton,

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
sending him crashing
to the Earth in flames

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and put out by a
tremendous flood of water

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.255 align:middle line:90%
from a river unseen before.

00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The common theme
we notice here is

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that of a salt water planet, the
great dragon, Lucifer, Tiamat,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
or Phaeton, was defeated
and fell to the Earth

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and now dwells in the abyss
known as hell, giving us

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
the outline of the
story of Lucifer

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.467 align:middle line:84%
rising up against the Lord and
being defeated and banished

00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:32.425 align:middle line:90%
to rule the underworld.

00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
As we know, however, an outline
is but a shell of a story.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The inner meaning, the
spirit of the myth,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
comes with a deeper
understanding

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:90%
of the essence of each planet.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Not just the physical planet,
but the conscious core.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Because we know now that
the proportions and velocity

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:84%
of a planet gives them their
own characteristic frequencies,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
which govern biological
and behavioral patterns.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
These planets reflect the
archetypal psychology of man.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, probably
the most important field

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
of research was the
study of the heavens.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Galactic bodies and their
movement through the sky

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
were known to be symbolic
of the inner faculties

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
within human consciousness.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Within all organisms,
outdated science

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
has only explained
the physical world

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:90%
measured by our five senses.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Only in esoteric religions,
mysticism, and quantum fields

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of science are we
to find any attempt

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
at explaining where
thoughts and emotions fit

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
into the
sense-perceptible world.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We also understand
now that humanity

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:84%
is a community of cells within
the organism of the Earth.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The Earth, therefore,
is a higher organism

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that shapes our
form and function.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
This higher organism and
all other planetary bodies

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
are governed by
consciousness, just

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.206 align:middle line:90%
as we individual humans are.

00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the Newtonian
belief that galactic bodies

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
are nothing more than lifeless
forms floating in space

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is tantamount to claiming
that we humans are

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
nothing more than a composite
of elements in motion.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We know that this is untrue
because we feel, we think,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and furthermore, we see the
result of our consciousness,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:90%
creating what we call life.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:10%
Plato wrote, "This
world is indeed

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:10%
a living being endowed with
a soul and intelligence--

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:10%
a single visible living entity
containing all other living

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:10%
entities, which by their
nature are all related.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, the cosmos is
a single living Creature

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:10%
which contains all living
creatures within it."

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:10%
And in an article out
of the Sufi Journal,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:10%
the author writes, "The world
is a living spiritual being.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:10%
This was understood by
the ancient philosophers

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:10%
and the alchemists who referred
to the spiritual essence

00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:10%
of the world as the anima mundi,
the 'Soul of the World.'" In

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:10%
scriptures, we hear of the claim
that angels guide the inner

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:10%
soulful actions of people, or
that the gods wield influence

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.830 align:middle line:10%
over man.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:10%
Most ancient spiritual
and scientific teachings

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:10%
held the belief
that the hierarchies

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:10%
of the gods, angels,
archangels, [? archi, ?]

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
cherubim and the seraphim,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
are the hierarchies
within the human psyche.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:10%
In this way, we must
understand that when

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:10%
the whole of ancient myths
and sacred scriptures

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:10%
speak of spiritual influence
from a higher being,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:10%
they were speaking of
archetypal forces that

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:10%
are inherent within
us, not an influence

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:10%
from an external source.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
This is where we begin to see
the relevance of astrology

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.990 align:middle line:84%
as an ancient form of
science that resurfaced

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th and 20th centuries
under the name of psychology.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:10%
Frederick Nietzche
even stated, "As long

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:10%
as you still experience the
stars as something above you,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:10%
you still lack a
viewpoint of knowledge."

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
This is astropsychology,
and that's

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the inner faculties
of the psyche.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:84%
In pre-Christian times, there
were schools known today

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
as the mystery schools
or the mystery religions.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The messages encoded
in the scriptures

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and ancient archaeology
came from adepts

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual science.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:84%
The intent was to
teach the initiates

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
the deeper meaning
of these myths.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
What became later termed as
Lucifer, Satan, or the devil,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
was representative of
the ego, which rivals

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the Lord, the
representative of the self.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The true self is the epicenter
of a person's entire being.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It is the total sum of
everything that we are.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The false ego, on
the other hand,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is the idea and concept
we create about ourselves

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.775 align:middle line:84%
in the course of our lives,
which typically excludes

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:84%
any qualities we don't wish
to accept about ourselves.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
However, humanity has been
endowed with the freedom

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to choose, either to
obey the true self,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.635 align:middle line:84%
or to give into the
temptation of the vanity

00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and materialism
of the false ego.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the most notable
trait that separates man

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
from animal, our
freedom of choice.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
The choice to follow
our concepts and ideals

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:90%
or our natural impulses.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The choice to sustain
nature or to destroy it.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
This freedom of choice weighs on
the fate of the entire organism

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that we call humanity.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Cancer begins with a group of
cells within a community that

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
fail to communicate with
the conscious signal

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
of the organism.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Those cells begin to grow
out of control and spread

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:90%
to other areas of the organism.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
This very disease is
evident in our world today.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The cancer upon our Earth is
the domination of our false ego

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and our divorce from nature.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, among
every human, vanity

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
leads to segregation
and competition.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Competition leads
to fear and greed.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Greed leads to deceit
and immorality.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And immorality is the
breeding ground for illness,

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:90%
waging war on our Earth.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Every act of hatred and
destructiveness in our world

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.476 align:middle line:84%
begins with self hate
and self-destructiveness.

00:19:06.476 --> 00:19:08.725 align:middle line:84%
And that all begins with a
breakdown in communication.

00:19:08.725 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
In nature, all that we
perceive with our five senses

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is a result of two
fundamental principles.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything in existence
is made of a relationship

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
between vibration and matter.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Vibration is a
masculine creative force

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
countered by matter, which is
a feminine receptive force.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Thus begins the
principle of duality.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We see this duality in ancient
myths and philosophies,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
yet only those
philosophies and scriptures

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that were perverted and
raped of the original meaning

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
gave the impression
that one polarity

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
was good while the
other was evil.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The original sages,
adepts, and shamans

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
taught that both are
necessary, and one would not

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%
exist without the other.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
These two important
principles come together

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.532 align:middle line:84%
to form all things
in the universe.

00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
This is kymatica.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Even language, logos,
the communication

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
of any and all things in nature,
depends upon this principle.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Pete Peterson in
his work, "Cymatics,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
the Science of the
Future," stated

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that "nature shows examples
of Kymatica in everything."

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.160 align:middle line:84%
This phenomena is found to be
one of the prime forces that

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
moves biological
evolution along its path."

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Dan Winter reproduced
an experiment

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:10%
to prove that the ancient
languages of Hebrew

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:10%
and Sanskrit, when spoken,
create a vibratory frequency

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:10%
that moved matter into
sacred geometrical patterns.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:10%
Upon further investigation,
Hebrew, Sanskrit, Aramaic,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:10%
Arabic, and other elder
dialects have older roots

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:10%
in a parent language of Gaelic
and quite possibly an even

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:10%
earlier origin.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
In Swami Murugesu's
"The Science of Mantra,"

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:84%
he claimed that when a
person chanted specific words

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
in Sanskrit while
filming a burning candle,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
the intensity as well as
the color of the flame

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:84%
would change due
to the frequency

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:90%
that the word would emit.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This same science has been
shown to lower and raise

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:90%
blood pressure.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:10%
And in his own words,
"Certain sounds

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:10%
can affect our circulation
and nervous system--

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:10%
whatever change such
vibrations cause

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:10%
extends to the mind of a person
and also to the surrounding

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:10%
atmosphere, causing
warmth or coolness.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:10%
All this can be known by
study and shown by practice."

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
This rediscovered knowledge
of the science of sound

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
shows that sound
is something more

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:90%
than mere vibratory signals.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Not only does sound
interact with life,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:90%
but it sustains and develops it.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It acts as a conduit
of conscious intent

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
between people, societies,
and entire civilizations.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Yet the psychic
illness we endure

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
due to the domination
of our false ego

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:90%
is reflected in the collective.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Our psychological
schism has shut us

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
off from communicating correctly
with our inner self, which

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
is exactly how cancer cells
within the body operate.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
In the collective, we've
created a language barrier

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
between humanity and
the rest of nature,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:90%
acting as a global cancer.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Recorded in history,
the efficacy

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient languages
has been severely uprooted.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:10%
The alphanumeric translation
from Hebrew to English

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:10%
shows a complete reversal
of the two languages,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:10%
giving the cymatic
affect unnatural results.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Leonard Horowitz
stated in his work on DNA,

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:10%
"one third of the
sensory-motor-cortex

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:10%
of the brain is devoted to the
tongue, oral cavity, the lips,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:10%
and speech.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:10%
In other words, oral frequency
emissions spoken or sung

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:10%
exert powerful
control over life,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:10%
vibrating genes that influence
total well-being and even

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:10%
evolution of the species."

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
A degradation of
language in this case

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:90%
is shown to affect biology.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
If something as basic
and important as language

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
can be degraded and
devalued to such a degree,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
yet never questioned, what
else might we be missing?

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Think of an aspect
of your life that

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
dictates the limits
of your freedom.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Government and law enforcement,
insurance and pharmaceutical

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:84%
companies, taxes, building
permits, driver's licenses,

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds,
if not thousands,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.224 align:middle line:84%
of stipulations, regulations,
and boundaries on our freedom.

00:23:56.224 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And out of the
ones that were just

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, how many have
you researched to find out

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:84%
whether they apply
to you or not?

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the forms of law
that we currently acquiesce to.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.860 align:middle line:84%
A common misconception
among people

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is that any rule or
regulation that governs them

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:90%
falls under one category, law.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
other forms of law

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that people abide by without
realizing that they simply

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:90%
do not apply to them.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Another misconception is that a
nation's constitution gives us

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:90%
our rights.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
A constitution does nothing
more than list the rights

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:90%
that we already have.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We are born with
inalienable rights,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:90%
endowed to us by our creator.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not given to us, and
they cannot be given away.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The most a person
can do with a right

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:84%
is choose whether to
exercise it or not.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Maritime admiralty law is what's
known as the law of the water.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
It is superseded by civil
law, and only applies

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to those who willingly
contract themselves into it.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
admiralty law is a body

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of private international law
governing the relationships

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.435 align:middle line:84%
between private entities, which
operate vessels on the oceans.

00:25:11.435 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at how
and why a form of law

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that is fashioned to govern
corporations, businesses,

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and vessels has imposed its
rule over natural human beings.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:84%
This is all done through
a form of word magic.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
A simple perversion
of language has

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
made it possible to convince
people around the world

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that these alternative
laws apply to them.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the predominant
beliefs in modern culture

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is that licenses,
permits, registrations,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of
documentation are

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
required to operate motor
vehicles, use public roads,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:84%
build structures
and establishments,

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
engage in free
enterprise, and much more.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, these beliefs are based
on little to no investigation

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.830 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever and are false.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
This belief structure
is perpetuated

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:90%
by maritime admiralty law.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:84%
This form of law was
originally created

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
to govern ships docking in
foreign nations for the import

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
or export of products
and resources.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It deals with banking
and merchant affairs, not

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:90%
civil affairs.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
When a product is
taken off of a ship

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and brought into a
foreign land, that nation

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
takes custody of the
resource and accounts for it

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:90%
with a certificate.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
That certificate
marks the birth date

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of that product in the custody
of the respective nation.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Think of why it is
supposedly required

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
to have a certificate of live
birth in the first place.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
The Baron's Dictionary
of Banking Terms

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
defines a certificate as a
paper establishing an ownership

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:90%
claim.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So right there, we notice
that everyone with a birth

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
certificate is defined
as being owned.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:84%
People are used as
collateral with other nations

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:90%
because the US is bankrupt.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The United States declared
bankruptcy on March 9 of 1933.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:10%
At this point, the
US began taking out

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.440 align:middle line:10%
loans from a private
non-government affiliated

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:10%
corporation called
the Federal Reserve.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:10%
With no money to
pay back the loans,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:10%
the United States began using
the citizens as collateral.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
All birth and
marriage certificates

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
are literally
warehouse receipts.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the similarities
of warehouse receipts and birth

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:90%
certificates.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Both document the date of issue,
a serial number, registration

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:10%
number or receipt number, a
description of the product,

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:10%
and an authorized
informant to notify

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:10%
the appropriate
government agency.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:10%
With all of this information
being readily available,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:10%
the majority of people are
unaware of their involvement

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:10%
with maritime admiralty law.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
This is possible through the
manipulation of language.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:84%
This admiralty law changed
the meaning of the word person

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:84%
from a natural, living
person to a corporation.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Driver's licenses, vehicle
registrations, auto insurance

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:84%
forms, building permits,
gun permits, work permits,

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.630 align:middle line:84%
tax filing documents, birth
and death certificates, traffic

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.500 align:middle line:84%
citations, and many other
forms of documentation

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that were once believed
to be absolutely necessary

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.426 align:middle line:84%
only apply to persons
or corporations.

00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Upon signing such
a legal document,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.380 align:middle line:84%
you are indirectly waiving your
rights under the Constitution

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and lowering your status to
that of a corporation that

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:84%
was created with the
same exact name as you.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:10%
The only way to
reconcile your true name

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:10%
from the name of
the corporation is

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.890 align:middle line:10%
to take notice that
the corporation has

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:10%
its name in all capital letters.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
This is known as capitis
diminutia maxima.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:10%
You may take notice that
your driver's license, birth

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:10%
certificate, social security
card, insurance cards, and more

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:10%
use all capital letters
to legally represent

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:10%
the corporation with
your name, not you.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:10%
The corporation is known
as an artificial person,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:10%
whereas you, the human being,
are known as a natural person.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
This deception goes even deeper
when it comes to the courts

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:90%
that we attend.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
When showing up
to court, you will

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
notice that there are seats for
witnesses behind a wooden fence

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:90%
or barrier.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.237 align:middle line:84%
The defendant must cross
through the entrance

00:29:30.237 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to the other side
of the barrier where

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
the plaintiff and judge sit.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:84%
This act symbolizes
the boarding of a ship.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:84%
At this time, business
can be conducted

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:90%
in maritime admiralty law.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:10%
The judge, acting as
captain or banker,

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:10%
is responsible for settling the
balance between the two sides.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:10%
This is why there's always
a monetary value involved

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:10%
in any court case.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The captain is simply dealing
with banking and merchant

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:90%
disputes.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Once the balance is
paid, the case is closed.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:84%
To turn the court case
away from admiralty law,

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:84%
where your rights
are not protected,

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
you must avoid
agreeing to represent

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.860 align:middle line:90%
the artificial person.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:84%
This is done by stating that
you are the natural person.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
first or last name

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because those imply
corporate title.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
In a court case, you may
state that the court takes

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:84%
judicial notice of your
honor's oath of office.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Every judge must take an oath
of office to practice law.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.120 align:middle line:10%
Yet you must make it clear
to the court and the jury

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.310 align:middle line:10%
that the judge is acting
as judge and not banker.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you are a natural
human being of the Earth.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You are not governed by anything
but your own consciousness.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Laws are created
within a society.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:84%
The society that
created the laws

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
we see being enforced today
is called the law society.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Yet the most beautiful part
of this entire deception

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that we are not
part of the law society,

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
so their laws do
not apply to us.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Judges, lawyers, and
law enforcement officers,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:90%
they're all part of a society.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Within that society, they've
created their own language

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that's deceptively
similar to English.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.545 align:middle line:84%
They have these little
things called statutes, acts,

00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and regulations
that seem like laws,

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
but they really only apply to
those within their society.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So that basically means all the
traffic violations, minimum age

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:84%
requirements, and
everything except for damage

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
to another person
or their property

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really apply
to the natural person.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Laws only apply to those
within the law society.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:84%
The game being played
is an illusion.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
You can simply choose
to open your eyes

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and reclaim the freedom that
you were born with, bound

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:84%
by nothing but the limits
of your imagination.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:84%
These are just a few
examples of assuring

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that your rights
are being protected.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
By far, the most
important line of defense

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
against this deception is to
be aware of the perversion

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of language and be
absolutely aware of how

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
you form your
beliefs and concepts.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.900 align:middle line:84%
In all forms of the
perversion of language,

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:84%
there's a mirror
reflection of this

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.005 align:middle line:90%
in the microcosm of the psyche.

00:32:30.005 --> 00:32:35.988 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.988 --> 00:32:38.448 align:middle line:84%
>>And the problem
I see with humanity

00:32:38.448 --> 00:32:41.400 align:middle line:84%
today is we don't truly
know ourselves anymore.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.368 align:middle line:90%
We have the nine to five job.

00:32:43.368 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We have the house, the children,
the bills, the television,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.350 align:middle line:84%
the hobbies, and the errands
that we run every single day.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And we eventually
begin to believe

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.870 align:middle line:90%
that this is who we are.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But who are we that
meet the job title,

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that meet the status of mother
or father, theist or atheist,

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Republican or Democrat,
black or white, man or woman.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.879 align:middle line:90%
Who are we deep down inside?

00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:10.272 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
because every time we

00:33:10.272 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:84%
see an answer that we don't
want to except about ourselves,

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:90%
we deny it.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We'll pass it off and
project it onto somebody else

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.645 align:middle line:90%
and judge them for it.

00:33:19.645 --> 00:33:20.631 align:middle line:90%
This is repression.

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And we see what
repression can do

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:84%
to us on an individual
level, but what

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.046 align:middle line:84%
about on a collective
level of humanity?

00:33:28.046 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
whole world refuses

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to see what they truly
are on the inside?

00:33:32.330 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:10%
>>Carl Jung discovered
that there's

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.100 align:middle line:10%
a collective unconscious
connected to all humans,

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:10%
meaning that the
whole of humanity

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:10%
shares a single mind
with one another.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.070 align:middle line:84%
This is evident in the world
through accounts of shared

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
mythology and symbols, the
study of morphic fields,

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:84%
and with the science
of kinesiology.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:84%
This collectivity
is a global example

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious mind of the
human body, in which trillions

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.929 align:middle line:90%
of cells share a similar signal.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:38.389 align:middle line:84%
This parasite
called our false ego

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
requires a continuous flow
of sustenance to survive.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:84%
Food, fuel, and any other
form of sustenance is energy.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:50.159 align:middle line:84%
Human consciousness is
an electromagnetic field

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.730 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
When this potential
energy is utilized,

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:84%
it then releases
kinetic energy, which

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
is used to perpetuate
the false ego.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.940 align:middle line:84%
This scenario occurs in the
smallest parasitic organisms,

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.410 align:middle line:84%
all the way to a collective
organism called humanity.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:84%
A parasite will
release chemicals

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
that cause the host to
crave the sustenance

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that the parasite
needs to survive.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:84%
As long as the
host is unaware, it

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.460 align:middle line:84%
will keep feeding the
parasite and starving itself.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.870 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, Wilhelm Reich
stated that whole societies

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:84%
suffer from a psychosis
caused by starving

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.300 align:middle line:90%
our organic biological impulses.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.570 align:middle line:84%
He states that "Sexual
suppression supports

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the power of the Church,
which has sunk very deep roots

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.570 align:middle line:84%
into the exploited masses
by means of sexual anxiety

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and guilt.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
It engenders timidity towards
authority and binds children

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.470 align:middle line:90%
to their parents.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:10%
This results in adult
subservience to state authority

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:10%
and to capitalistic
exploitation.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:10%
It paralyzes the
intellectual critical powers

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:10%
of the oppressed masses
because it consumes the greater

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:10%
part of biological energy.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it paralyzes
the resolute development

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.670 align:middle line:84%
of creative forces and renders
impossible the achievement

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
of all aspirations
for human freedom.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.560 align:middle line:84%
In this way the
prevailing economic system

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in which single individuals
can easily rule entire masses

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
becomes rooted in the
psychic structures

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of the oppressed themselves."

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:84%
What Reich was showing
in this powerful quote

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is that on a collective
level, the suppression

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of a natural function,
whether biological,

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.000 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, or
emotional, will result

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:84%
in an abnormal reaction,
a psychic disease.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:84%
This illness or disease is
reflected into the masses

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
through a collective unconscious
and acts as an epidemic.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is plagued with
an incapacity for freedom,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:84%
meaning that people en
masse lack the ability

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to govern themselves
on a psychic level,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and this manifests in the
macrocosm as government

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and organized religious powers.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Thus opening the throne, our
national and individual throne,

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:90%
to anyone and anything.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.285 align:middle line:84%
Enter the infamous
rulers of the Earth.

00:37:09.285 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The patriarchs of civilization,
political, social, economic,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual dictatorship.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Psychic tyranny.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:84%
This simple illness
within our psyche,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.730 align:middle line:84%
this lack of responsibility and
neglect of basic human freedom,

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.650 align:middle line:84%
has made way for every tyrant
that has ever held rule

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:90%
over people on this planet.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But these oppressive
tyrants that

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:84%
are demonized by the masses
are no different than us.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they are one with us.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:10%
In the book "The Prophet"
by Kahlil Gibran,

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:10%
he poetically states, "I say,
as the holy and the righteous

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:10%
cannot rise beyond the highest
which is in each of you,

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:10%
so the wicket and the weak
cannot fall lower than

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:10%
the lowest which
is in you also."

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us
has the capability

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to commit the most
horrifying sin

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.210 align:middle line:84%
or show the most beautiful
compassion to our fellow man.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the very
definition of an illness

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:84%
within the psyche
and soul of man.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:39:00.400 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of any position
of power that you

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.070 align:middle line:90%
believe to be above you.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Royal families, government
leaders, the United Nations,

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
financial organizations,
corporate monopolies, and media

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.880 align:middle line:90%
juggernauts.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
These are all facets
of our false ego.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:84%
They're the physical
advent of our own sickness.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They require our
conscious participation,

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:84%
our conscious
energy, to survive.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Because without our cooperation,
without supplying them

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:84%
with the sustenance of
complicity, they starve.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Their very nature depends
on our desire to be ruled.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And a typical symptom of the
illness among humanity today

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
is a continuous
denial of our illness.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Repression.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.940 align:middle line:84%
We consistently
repressed those qualities

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:84%
we choose not to
accept about ourselves.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is
so difficult to see

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:84%
the false ego in its
multiple manifestations

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.780 align:middle line:90%
for what they truly are.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.365 align:middle line:84%
This is the very nature
of the false ego.

00:40:17.365 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It acts as a red
herring to distract us

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.080 align:middle line:90%
from the freedom we truly have.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.400 align:middle line:84%
For this psychic
parasite to survive,

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:84%
it must supply us
with a chemical that

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.580 align:middle line:84%
will cause us to remain
dependent upon it.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.770 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the sustenance
is our conscious energy.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And in order for us to
feed it to the parasite,

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:84%
the chemical of
fear causes humanity

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.700 align:middle line:90%
to crave protection and defense.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>The functions of
the body to survive

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
can be broken down to two basic
functions for any organism

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.230 align:middle line:10%
You have to be able to grow,
maintain yourself, take

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.530 align:middle line:10%
care of your biology.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:10%
But you also must be
able to protect yourself,

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:10%
so that if you're just growing
and you can't protect yourself,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:10%
you'll become food
for something else.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So survival involves a balance
between growth and protection.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Through the history
of human civilization

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and human evolution,
we recognize

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that our nature is to
be in a state of growth,

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and that our protection
is only supposed

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to be used to help us out
of that threatening moment.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't be in growth and in
protection at the same time.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So the significance is, when
we see a need of protection,

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.730 align:middle line:84%
the stress hormones in the
body shut off the blood vessels

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:84%
in our viscera,
our gut, which is

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.070 align:middle line:90%
the part of the body for growth.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Well the issue is, if you took
the blood from the viscera

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and moved it out
to the arms, then

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.400 align:middle line:84%
you left no blood
in the viscera.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.602 align:middle line:84%
That means no growth, but
you're ready to fight.

00:41:53.602 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And when your
fighting is finished,

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.980 align:middle line:84%
then the blood returns
back to the viscera,

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:90%
and you grow again.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.905 align:middle line:84%
But in the world that we live
in today, it's 24/7 fear.

00:42:01.905 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have a continuous
dripping of that stress hormone

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.735 align:middle line:84%
It's just dripping
all the time, getting

00:42:14.735 --> 00:42:16.870 align:middle line:84%
us ready to run
or fight or flight

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:84%
at any moment at
the drop of a hat.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We're ready to go
because we're on guard.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem
is what does that

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.355 align:middle line:84%
mean about your
allocation of energy?

00:42:25.355 --> 00:42:28.255 align:middle line:84%
It says we're spending most
of our energy on protection.

00:42:28.255 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You cannot survive if you're
in protection all the time.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>And if the parasite can
control the nature of the fear,

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.180 align:middle line:84%
it can then create
a fear among us

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that only it can
defend us against.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.050 align:middle line:84%
A recent physical
manifestation of this

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:84%
comes from Zbignew Brzezinski,
former Secretary of State

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:84%
who also supported
President Barack Obama.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.820 align:middle line:10%
In his book, "The Grand
Chessboard," he states,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.590 align:middle line:10%
"As America becomes an
increasingly multicultural

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:10%
society, it may find it
more difficult to fashion

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.970 align:middle line:10%
a consensus of
foreign policy issues

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:10%
except in the circumstance
of a truly massive and widely

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.130 align:middle line:10%
perceived direct
external threat."

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:10%
Even the Reich Fuhrer of the
Nazi Party, Hermann Goering,

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.040 align:middle line:10%
sums up this game of supply
and demand perfectly when

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:10%
he stated, "The
people can always

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:10%
be brought to the
bidding of the leaders.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.441 align:middle line:10%
That is easy.

00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:39.940 align:middle line:10%
All you have to do
is tell them they

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:10%
are being attacked and denounce
the peacemakers for lack

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:10%
of patriotism and exposing
the country to danger.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:10%
It works the same
in any country."

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It also works the same in
every individual psyche.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Just remember that the false
ego has only one desire,

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to become greater and more
powerful than the true self.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This illness causes
us to believe

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are separate
from nature.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.900 align:middle line:84%
This is why we see such
a rise in the dependency

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.590 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:84%
This is why we see
such little stewardship

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.870 align:middle line:84%
for the earth and
the environment.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we see
bigotry, racism, sexism,

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and every other form
of discrimination

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.510 align:middle line:84%
possible that leads to crime,
violence, wars, and eventually,

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:84%
the global destruction
of the organism.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.290 align:middle line:84%
This endless state of fear,
confusion, and segregation

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.610 align:middle line:84%
our world seems to
live in is a symptom

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of the false ego
creating a false threat.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:55.940 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Many of the United
States presidents

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.270 align:middle line:84%
have blood relations
with each other.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The Bush lineage has blood
ties to a great number

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.920 align:middle line:90%
of former Presidents.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:84%
George Washington, Millard
Fillmore, Franklin Pierce,

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses
Grant, Rutherford Hayes,

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.990 align:middle line:84%
James Garfield, Grover
Cleveland, Teddy Roosevelt,

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:18.320 align:middle line:84%
William Taft, Calvin
Coolidge, Herbert Hoover,

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Franklin Roosevelt, Richard
Nixon, and Gerald Ford.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.300 align:middle line:10%
Michael Tsarion
points out in his work

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.260 align:middle line:10%
that "Bush is closely related
to every European monarch

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.040 align:middle line:10%
on and off the throne
and has kinship

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:10%
with every member of
Britain's royal family.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:10%
Bush's family tree can
be documented as far back

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.260 align:middle line:10%
as the early 15th century.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.750 align:middle line:10%
He has a direct
descent from Henry III

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.180 align:middle line:10%
and from Henry VIII's
sister Mary Tudor.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:50.490 align:middle line:10%
He is also descended from
Charles II of England."

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:10%
And we also find
that George W Bush

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.460 align:middle line:10%
is a direct descendant
of Godfroi de Bouillon.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:10%
Godfroi was the first
king of Jerusalem

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:10%
after he recaptured it
from the Saracens, which

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:10%
was the name for the Islamic
faith during the Middle Ages.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting to note
that the current occupation

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
in the Middle East

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.745 align:middle line:84%
was reestablished by the
same family, George Bush

00:46:10.745 --> 00:46:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Sr. in 1991, and again by
George Bush Jr. in 2003.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.590 align:middle line:84%
George Bush Jr. is then found
to be a cousin to both opposing

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:24.700 align:middle line:84%
candidates of his two terms in
office, Al Gore and John Kerry.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Democratic president
Barack Obama

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.550 align:middle line:84%
also has blood ties
with George W Bush,

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:33.410 align:middle line:84%
as well as Gerald Ford,
Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman,

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:84%
James Madison, and the British
Prime Minister, Sir Winston

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Churchill.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.940 align:middle line:84%
On the opposing side of the
2008 presidential ballot,

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.440 align:middle line:84%
John McCain is descended from
Robert the Bruce, King William

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I of Scotland, and also
Godfroi de Bouillon.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.941 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.941 --> 00:46:54.815 align:middle line:84%
>>Probably one of the
most interesting facets

00:46:54.815 --> 00:46:56.720 align:middle line:84%
of the bloodline
relations is the fact

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that the whole
British royal family

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.945 align:middle line:84%
has descent from the
Muslim prophet Muhammad

00:47:01.945 --> 00:47:04.040 align:middle line:84%
through the Arab
kings of Seville.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.880 align:middle line:84%
This bloodline was passed
through the kings of Portugal,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Castile, and eventually
down to King Edward IV.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a very,
very different story

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:15.480 align:middle line:84%
from what you hear the media
pumping out every day, being

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:90%
this idea of lineal superiority.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's completely
debunked according

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to the foremost authority of
aristocratic lineage, Burke's

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Peerage.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And this just goes to show
that there's the true story,

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
manufactured illusion,

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:32.673 align:middle line:84%
the front, that's
given to the public.

00:47:32.673 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>These blood ties go on and on,
and are documented thoroughly

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.050 align:middle line:84%
through literature
such as Burke's Peerage

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:90%
and other comparable books.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The point of all
of this is that we

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
find not just the same
people, but the same intent

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
within the people who have held
high positions of monarchy,

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.250 align:middle line:84%
dynasty, aristocracy,
and democracy

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:90%
in the past and present.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And they are all related by
a physical and symbolic link.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.285 align:middle line:84%
This bloodline carries
the symbol of our illness.

00:48:07.285 --> 00:48:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms of our
psychospiritual illness

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.990 align:middle line:84%
are the wars, terrorist
attacks, artificial or man

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.020 align:middle line:84%
made disasters,
and leader figures.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:84%
As long as the people remain
oblivious to their inner drives

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and inner nature,
they will always

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.850 align:middle line:84%
fail to recognize why
these events take place

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and why these figures rise
to such powerful positions.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we have
failed for thousands of years

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to conquer these
archetypal rulers

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.880 align:middle line:84%
permanently is because
for thousands of years,

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
we've been fighting the symptoms
of an illness and not the root

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.340 align:middle line:90%
cause.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.030 align:middle line:84%
For every corrupted
government that

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:84%
falls at the hands
of a revolutionary,

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:20.010 align:middle line:84%
oppressed people, two more will
rise in its place every time.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the root cause
of a corrupt government

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:26.610 align:middle line:84%
does not exist in the individual
leading that government.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It exists within the
psyche of every individual.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Because an unaware host
to a deadly parasite

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.000 align:middle line:84%
will do anything to avoid
accepting his own incapacity

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.516 align:middle line:90%
for freedom.

00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:51.010 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.510 align:middle line:84%
We are so bereft of
sanity in this world

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that those few who simply
stop projecting onto others

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and begin facing their own
demons are seen as neurotic.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.040 align:middle line:84%
An article written
in the 1950s states

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:84%
that "Studies showed
that individuals

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:09.300 align:middle line:84%
who had been isolated from their
familiar social and cultural

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:90%
environment became neurotic.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:84%
This shows that when those
individuals had no object

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.150 align:middle line:84%
to identify their
darker emotions with,

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.290 align:middle line:84%
they began to see these things
in themselves that which they

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.850 align:middle line:84%
refused to recognize before,
and were unaware of why

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:28.560 align:middle line:90%
they appeared and how to cope."

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Facing our true inner self is
virtually unknown in our world

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.250 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is why no matter how many
civilizations rise and fall,

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.710 align:middle line:84%
it is our collective
consciousness that

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:42.080 align:middle line:84%
creates our governing apparatus,
not individual people.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:54.450 align:middle line:90%


00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And after countless
attempts, you

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:57.700 align:middle line:84%
would imagine that
people would realize

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:01.366 align:middle line:84%
that a physical retaliation
may not be the solution.

00:51:01.366 --> 00:51:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet here we are,
thousands of years

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.920 align:middle line:84%
later, with technology
that can clone DNA,

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.910 align:middle line:84%
vehicles that can
break the sound barrier

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and probe the depths
of space, and science

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that can overcome
almost any sickness.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Yet we still fail to take notice
to the importance of thoughts

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the very
definition of insanity.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of us is responsible

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:84%
for this psychic
epidemic, because we're

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.515 align:middle line:84%
killing the messenger and paying
no attention to the message.

00:51:31.515 --> 00:52:00.180 align:middle line:90%


00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.680 align:middle line:84%
"During the 1990s, three
Nobel laureates in medicine

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.250 align:middle line:84%
advanced research that revealed
the primary function of DNA

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.130 align:middle line:84%
lies not in protein
synthesis, as widely believed

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for the past century, but
in electromagnetic energy

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.140 align:middle line:90%
reception and transmission.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Less than 3% of DNA's function
involves protein manufacture.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.620 align:middle line:84%
More than 90%
functions in the realm

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of bioacoustic and bioelectric
electric signaling."

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So why is it important to
know that DNA functions

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:32.250 align:middle line:90%
in bioelectric signaling?

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.710 align:middle line:84%
HEARTMATH Institute has
discovered, "The heart

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and brain maintain a
continuous two-way dialogue,

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.730 align:middle line:84%
each influencing the
other's functioning.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Although it is not
well known, the heart

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:84%
sends far more
information to the brain

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.080 align:middle line:84%
than the brain
sends to the heart,

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and the signals the
heart sends to the brain

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:52.410 align:middle line:84%
can influence perception,
emotional processing,

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and higher cognitive functions."

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The heart also
generates the strongest

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:00.100 align:middle line:84%
rhythmic electromagnetic
field in the body.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And this actually
can be measured

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.950 align:middle line:84%
in the brain waves
of people around us.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:08.040 align:middle line:84%
We are quite literally an
electromagnetic expression

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of our highest
cognitive function.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:84%
The behavior of
electromagnetism is

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:16.650 align:middle line:84%
evident throughout
the world as dualism.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:19.700 align:middle line:84%
All matter contains a
negative and positive charge,

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:24.090 align:middle line:84%
which means organisms are
built upon this foundation.

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:27.490 align:middle line:84%
The natural homeostasis
of any organism

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:30.970 align:middle line:90%
is a balance of both polarities.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, research
on emotional energetics

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.540 align:middle line:84%
shows that "the heart's
field is a carrier

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.900 align:middle line:84%
of emotional information
and a mediator

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of bio-electromagnetic
communication

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.170 align:middle line:90%
within and outside the body.

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Research shows our
heart's field changes

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:48.490 align:middle line:84%
distinctly as we experience
different emotions.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.740 align:middle line:10%
It is registered in
people's brains around us

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:54.210 align:middle line:10%
and apparently is capable
of affecting cells, water,

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:10%
and DNA studied in vitro."

00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Fear.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The chemical supplied
by a collective parasite

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:84%
creates a distinctive
bioelectric signal given off

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.670 align:middle line:90%
by the host.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This signal is disseminated
to the organisms

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.050 align:middle line:84%
within our community
and will grow

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:84%
outward through
the entire organism

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:16.380 align:middle line:84%
unless it is counterbalanced
by an opposing force.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp discovered
that the cells in our body

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.600 align:middle line:84%
communicate through
biophotons, which

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.310 align:middle line:84%
are tiny particles
of light that are

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:84%
single units of an
electromagnetic field.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.510 align:middle line:84%
This communication
system within our body

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:84%
also exists between
people in what's

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.820 align:middle line:90%
known as morphic resonance.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.930 align:middle line:84%
This was known by the shamans,
sages, and adepts of antiquity.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:42.220 align:middle line:84%
These teachings were commonplace
in prehistoric cultures.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't by sheer chance that
artistic expression and rituals

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:49.340 align:middle line:84%
were the cornerstone of
every ancient civilization.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:10%
Art was used as
a personal method

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.630 align:middle line:10%
to exercise the shadow
content of the psyche

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:57.250 align:middle line:10%
and introduce it to
the conscious mind.

00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:00.640 align:middle line:10%
This was very literally
viewed as psychic therapy.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Ritual was based around
astrological dates.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.990 align:middle line:84%
As we've learned, the study
of the stars and planets

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.575 align:middle line:84%
reflect our own
astro psychology.

00:55:09.575 --> 00:55:11.630 align:middle line:84%
The shamans would
perform rituals

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:14.740 align:middle line:84%
on astrological dates that
would correlate with a circadian

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.050 align:middle line:90%
rhythm or a psychological cycle.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.080 align:middle line:84%
These rituals kept
the human participants

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.770 align:middle line:84%
aware of their inner self
and prevented the repression

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:26.260 align:middle line:90%
of psychological content.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.560 align:middle line:84%
As long as people were
facing their inner demons

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and accepting them
as their own, they

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:35.890 align:middle line:84%
were not collectively projecting
them into the physical world.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:38.400 align:middle line:84%
"If you bring forth
what is within you,

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:84%
what you bring
forth will save you.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.870 align:middle line:84%
If you do not bring forth what
is within you, what you do not

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:47.390 align:middle line:90%
bring forth will destroy you."

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.900 align:middle line:84%
The progeny of our
psychological disease

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.880 align:middle line:84%
began growing rapidly after
a series of catastrophes

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:84%
forced the collective into
a somatic state of fight

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.710 align:middle line:90%
or flight.

00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:59.860 align:middle line:84%
This lowered the immunity
of the population

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.080 align:middle line:84%
by introducing a state
of immense stress.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Our body becomes more
susceptible to illness

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.020 align:middle line:90%
under stress.

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.910 align:middle line:84%
In this manner, humanity fell
ill when entire bodies of land

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:13.430 align:middle line:84%
were swallowed up
by the floodwaters.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:16.610 align:middle line:84%
This uprooted many tribes,
chieftains, and civilizations

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.200 align:middle line:84%
from their homes and their
ritual practices that

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.840 align:middle line:84%
were used as a conduit
for psychic wellness

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.900 align:middle line:84%
or put on hold in order
to survive the catastrophe

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.560 align:middle line:90%
and seek new homes.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The shamans were spread to
many new areas of the world.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.400 align:middle line:84%
This information
has been suppressed.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We are made to believe
that advanced civilization

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:38.710 align:middle line:84%
such as ancient Egypt and
the Mayans of Mesoamerica

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:41.200 align:middle line:84%
came about with no prior
rudimentary remnants

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.990 align:middle line:84%
or evidence of evolving
intellectual artifacts to bring

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:45.449 align:middle line:90%
them to their peak.

00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to believe that
their incredible knowledge

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of mathematics, astrology,
agriculture, economy, polity,

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and architecture
came out of nowhere.

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:57.620 align:middle line:84%
This leads many researchers
today to the understanding

00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.610 align:middle line:84%
that the origins of
these civilizations

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:01.310 align:middle line:90%
have been suppressed.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly,
the force that has

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.410 align:middle line:84%
guided the suppression
of this knowledge

00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:08.340 align:middle line:84%
comes from the exact bloodline
of the political and religious

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.475 align:middle line:90%
leaders stated previously.

00:57:09.475 --> 00:57:12.009 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.009 --> 00:57:13.800 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the
notable book burnings

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.175 align:middle line:84%
and suppression of important
texts in our history.

00:57:16.175 --> 00:57:25.818 align:middle line:90%


00:57:25.818 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Yet after all of
this suppression,

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:29.880 align:middle line:84%
there are still remnants
of the dispersion

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.730 align:middle line:84%
of elder civilizations
in nearly every country.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.680 align:middle line:84%
There's tremendous evidence of
ancient cultures visiting North

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.890 align:middle line:84%
America long before
the conventional belief

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of European colonization.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:45.020 align:middle line:10%
Barry Fell states in
his book, "America, BC",

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.590 align:middle line:10%
"There are ancient
inscriptions now

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.730 align:middle line:10%
being reported from nearly all
parts of the United States,

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:10%
Canada, and Latin
America-- written

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.750 align:middle line:10%
in various European and
Mediterranean languages

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:59.110 align:middle line:10%
in alphabets that date
from 2,500 years ago.

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.190 align:middle line:10%
William Comyns Beaumont
wrote, "the Toltec and Maya

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.440 align:middle line:10%
civilizations never
originated on American soil

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.800 align:middle line:10%
but appeared there full
blown, with a well-defined art

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.030 align:middle line:10%
and system of hieroglyphic
writing, which

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:10%
possesses affinities
with Egyptian."

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:16.310 align:middle line:10%
It is found that
there are thousands

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:18.370 align:middle line:10%
of prehistoric sites
across New England

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.210 align:middle line:10%
and several other northern
states showing inscriptions,

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:24.400 align:middle line:10%
carvings, and mounds
created by Druidic mariners

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.165 align:middle line:10%
as far back as 800 BC.

00:58:26.165 --> 00:58:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.020 align:middle line:84%
To suppress this
information further,

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.050 align:middle line:84%
it was not only imperative
for the bloodline

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to burn the documented
text containing

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.750 align:middle line:84%
true historical information, but
to wipe out the cultures that

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:41.080 align:middle line:84%
derived from these
ancient shamans.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.250 align:middle line:84%
The most devastating
genocide ever

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:46.330 align:middle line:84%
endured was and still
is the annihilation

00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:49.260 align:middle line:90%
of shamanic tribes.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>We've lost our
traditional roots

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:52.750 align:middle line:90%
and don't know our ritual.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The dragon dances and the ghost
dances of the Native American

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Indians, what do you
think that was all about?

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.780 align:middle line:84%
All the shamans of the world,
when they do their rituals,

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.900 align:middle line:84%
they're doing that-- their work
harmonically through dances--

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is to strengthen the
immune system of the Earth.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:07.970 align:middle line:90%
But they've been all murdered.

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:09.804 align:middle line:84%
So that was why in the
17th century, exactly

00:59:09.804 --> 00:59:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the same period
I'm talking about,

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.070 align:middle line:84%
there was an all
out agenda that when

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:16.930 align:middle line:84%
you come across indigenous
people, you annihilate them.

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Columbus was sent
on his expedition

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.160 align:middle line:84%
along with agents of
the crown to disrupt

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the lives of the natives
and seize mineral resources.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.590 align:middle line:84%
He visited every island in the
Caribbean, depleting the gold

00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and taking as many slaves of the
native Taino tribe as possible.

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:35.160 align:middle line:84%
"Five million natives were
murdered within three years,"

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.450 align:middle line:90%
according to Leah Trabich.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:41.340 align:middle line:84%
"Within 15 years, the
Arawak tribe of 250,000

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.050 align:middle line:90%
was completely wiped out."

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:45.720 align:middle line:84%
"The population of
the United States

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.550 align:middle line:84%
prior to European contact
was greater than 12 million.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Four centuries later, the count
was reduced by 95% to 237,000."

00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.580 align:middle line:10%
"From 1494 to 1508, over
three million people

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:05.270 align:middle line:10%
had perished from war,
slavery, and the mines.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:08.210 align:middle line:10%
Who in future generations
will believe this?

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:11.250 align:middle line:10%
I myself writing this as a
knowledgeable eyewitness can

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:12.620 align:middle line:10%
hardly believe it.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.930 align:middle line:84%
My eyes have seen these acts
so foreign to human nature,

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:20.540 align:middle line:90%
and now I tremble as I write."

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Another agent of the
false ego bloodline

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
was Hernando Cortez, who
decimated the Aztec tribe

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and plundered their
mineral resources.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:31.390 align:middle line:10%
This again was the case
through Cortez's second cousin,

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:35.790 align:middle line:10%
Francisco Pizarro, who conquered
the Incan Empire in Peru.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
These atrocities are seen
throughout Africa, New Zealand,

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
New Guinea, East Timor, and
are still seen today in Canada.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
This was a deliberate attempt
to bury any surviving remnants

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient world
and our true history.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It is a naive mistake, however,
to categorize and blame

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
everything and everyone involved
with politics or religion

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
for this suppression
of knowledge.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
It is only natural for people
to crave spiritual understanding

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:04.570 align:middle line:84%
when there are so many
manufactured missing links

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and perversions in the
spiritual texts today.

01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And due to this void
of spiritual wisdom,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
honest and moral
people who are simply

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
their place in this world

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:17.426 align:middle line:84%
become the prime
consumer market for those

01:01:17.426 --> 01:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
who wish to exploit
this vulnerability.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.160 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>The ego is something
that is insecure.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.205 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is in need of control.

01:01:30.205 --> 01:01:32.370 align:middle line:10%
The ego actually is
an interior thing,

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:37.000 align:middle line:10%
but it's trying to act like it
is something that is superior.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Hence this schism
occurs between the ego

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and between the
unconscious, or the self.

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of a
messiah complex at work

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
here as well, I feel, that
we project the savior type

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
ideal on someone, and we
expect them to save us.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And we are not willing
ourselves to deal with this

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:59.395 align:middle line:84%
and get to the root of why
we perhaps feel insecure

01:01:59.395 --> 01:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
or why we feel we
don't have enough power

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.130 align:middle line:90%
to run our own lives, basically.

01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
New Age movement,

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
for instance, which is another
kind of trap in all this,

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
where people might
end up actually,

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
they're looking for
something so bad

01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're taking
all these things that

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
are handed to us or to
them, but it's not really

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:22.580 align:middle line:90%
based on any real understanding.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's still kind of coming from
a religious type of perspective.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.150 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
People are genuinely
seeking something new.

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
They're genuinely seeking
a new type of spirituality

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
or to better themselves
or to change something.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.902 align:middle line:90%
But this has been hijacked.

01:02:40.902 --> 01:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And what they actually
do is that they lead you

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
into another type of
group mentality, a New Age

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.180 align:middle line:90%
religion, whatever it is.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And people still are not
able to kind of really

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
break free from that to
follow their own journey

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
or their own path which I
think is very important.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%


01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>In the pre-Christian
era, there

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.510 align:middle line:84%
were several cults of
incredible power, most notably

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
the Stellar, Solar, Saturnian,
Lunar, and Mushroom Cults.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It is simple to see that
worshippers of the Lunar

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:26.565 align:middle line:84%
goddess comprised
of the Lunar Cult.

01:03:26.565 --> 01:03:29.110 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The worship of sun gods were
indicative of the Solar Cults.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.860 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
The Saturnian Cult, which
consisted of Phoenicians

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and Canonites,
worshipped El, or Eli.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
The biblical exodus of
the Hebrews from Egypt

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
showed that they
entered Canon and merged

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the Lunar Cult of Isis,
the Solar Cult of Ra,

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and the Saturnian Cult of
El to form Isis, Ra, El.

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Israel.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
"The old Israelitish cult and
mythology, the Yahweh-worship,

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
the patriarchal legends, the
sojourn in Egypt, and so on,

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
are rooted in the religion of
the sacred fungus, developed

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
from the underlying fertility
philosophy of the ancient Near

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
East."

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish mitre, Muslim
turbans, and military berets

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
are derivations of the
symbol of the Mushroom Cult.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
and most prominent,

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:24.040 align:middle line:90%
however, was the Stellar Cult.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And a number of
these ancient cults

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
were created for
shamanic purposes

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and earthly stewardship.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Yet some were taken over
with different intentions.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.780 align:middle line:10%
Just as you would imagine in
any establishment of power,

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.775 align:middle line:10%
smaller cults formed
within the main cults

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:41.690 align:middle line:10%
to worship individual deities.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:46.430 align:middle line:10%
The Cult of Mithras and the Cult
of Dionysus are two examples.

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
You still today can see the
Mithraic or Phrygian cap

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
on the symbol of the
Seated Liberty dollar,

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
the coat of arms
of many countries,

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the reverse side of
the flag of Paraguay,

01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
the seal of the
United States Senate,

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and even involved in
the Solar Cult holiday

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.160 align:middle line:90%
that we now call Christmas.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
In the cult of
Dionysus, many festivals

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
were celebrated, such as the
greater Dionysia, celebrated

01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in Athens around
the spring equinox.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
The foremost event
in this festival

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
was the final contest, in
which poets, musicians,

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and entertainers performed
in an open air theater.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Musicians did not
have to pay taxes,

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and members of
the artists' guild

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
did not have to participate
in military affairs.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.750 align:middle line:84%
The cult of Dionysus is
still alive to this day

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
as the entertainment industry.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:56.200 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.000 align:middle line:10%
These cults still exist in many
important positions of power

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.660 align:middle line:10%
throughout the entire
civilized world.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.070 align:middle line:10%
Yet the most important
function of these groups

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:09.500 align:middle line:10%
is to manufacture the consent
and complicity of the people.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>The conscious mind
is the creative mind.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that has your
personal identity into it.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.150 align:middle line:90%
It does the real thinking.

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
subconscious mind.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.009 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's no entity in it.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:22.280 align:middle line:10%
The subconscious mind is
equivalent of a tape player.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.020 align:middle line:10%
It records behaviors and
then, at the push of a button,

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:25.880 align:middle line:10%
plays the behaviors.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.820 align:middle line:10%
It's automatic.

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.870 align:middle line:10%
It's a very convenient
thing because then we

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.530 align:middle line:10%
don't have to
relearn all the time.

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Once you know it, you
can make a pattern.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that the basic
patterns of belief and behavior

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that are programmed in
the subconscious mind

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
came from our teachers,
primarily our parents,

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.125 align:middle line:90%
our family, and our community.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.250 align:middle line:10%
>>See, most people don't
even understand how easily

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.270 align:middle line:10%
we're influenced
by our environment.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.652 align:middle line:10%
Every person we encounter,
every single situation

01:06:49.652 --> 01:06:51.610 align:middle line:10%
that we're faced with,
every little word that's

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:53.870 align:middle line:10%
said on television
may not seem too

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.970 align:middle line:10%
influential to our
conscious minds,

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:59.250 align:middle line:10%
but your unconscious is
designed specifically

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.140 align:middle line:10%
to let every
environmental signal

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.854 align:middle line:10%
influence you without
your awareness.

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So the question
is, are we leading

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:08.030 align:middle line:90%
conscious or unconscious lives?

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And now neuroscience
has told us,

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
in the unfolding of our
lives, only 5% of our life

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is controlled by our conscious
mind, and 95% of the time

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
controlled by the
subconscious with programs

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.810 align:middle line:84%
from other people that
were installed in there.

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, it means
when those programs are

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.510 align:middle line:90%
playing, we don't see them.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>And the skeptics
will sit there

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, consciousness,
archetypes, astrology?

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We create things with
our hands, not our minds.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Archetypes aren't physical.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.400 align:middle line:90%
They can't influence me.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you think of
the fact that we're

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
only conscious of this
small, little fraction

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:46.845 align:middle line:84%
of our behavior,
what we don't realize

01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
is that entire countries,
entire civilizations, that

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
think they're free
and independent,

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
but are unconsciously too afraid
to be free and independent,

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
they will beg to be governed.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And if they can't
do it themselves,

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
who do you think will
consciously or unconsciously

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.770 align:middle line:90%
take that responsibility?

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It usually ends up being that
strong, masculine, animus

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
archetypal figure.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
When we think we're
in danger, we're

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
not looking for our
mother to nurture us.

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.189 align:middle line:84%
We want our father
to protect us.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And right on cue,
with the age of fear,

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
this age of catastrophe,
the age of this parasite,

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
we see masculine domination.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.910 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:29.979 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary conduits
for giving our responsibility

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and our conscious
energy away is money.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
We surely don't want to admit
that our dependency on money

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
is flawed because
that would imply

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.550 align:middle line:90%
that the fault is our own.

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And god forbid we take
responsibility for our lives.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.109 align:middle line:90%
So we blame the money.

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:45.890 align:middle line:90%


01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the cornerstone
of the entire illusion being

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
built around us
by the false ego.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Money is said to be
the root of all evil,

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:57.260 align:middle line:84%
yet it cannot be evil because
money is only a symbol.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Symbols carry only the faith
and spirit of the observer.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.649 align:middle line:84%
This means that the
symbol of paper money

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:07.529 align:middle line:84%
evokes and services the evil
intentions and inherent flaw

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:09.580 align:middle line:90%
of our false ego.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Money only exists because we
agree to accept it as valuable.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And to further illustrate
our incapacity for freedom,

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we've given the control
of our faith-based money

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
to a private corporation instead
of the federal government.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
There is no law
stating that we have

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to use Federal Reserve
notes as currency.

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We choose to because we fear
the alternative, independence.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:46.450 align:middle line:90%


01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>But it's not even
really about money.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It's about energy.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Because money is simply
this material thing that

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
allows billions of people
to crave just one thing

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and put their energy
into the same thing.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not the plasma
TV or the house

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
or the lifestyle or the job
or the significant other

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
or the status that
we're really after.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
that we're empty.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
These people feel
sadness and loneliness

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
and void just like anybody else.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And they either want to fill
that void with materialism

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.500 align:middle line:84%
because they think that that
will make them feel better,

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
or they want to sedate
the void feeling

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.430 align:middle line:90%
with material possessions.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So it all comes
back to this feeling

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
of having to put our dependency
into an external source,

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
something that we have
absolutely no control over.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>What we're seeing right
now, with all the competition

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of each other, destroying
each other, wars,

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
competing for material
existing, raping the planet

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and tearing it apart to
get some pieces of it

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to hold in your hands
and say you won the game,

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
every one of those
moves is destructive,

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
not just of the planet,
but of human civilization.

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Because human civilization
will thrive with cooperation

01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:59.349 align:middle line:90%
and will die with competition.

01:10:59.349 --> 01:11:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you operate
from these truths,

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:06.480 align:middle line:84%
then you end up with the
extinction that lies before us.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>You see, we all have
demons, so to speak.

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We all have inner
demons in our lives.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.907 align:middle line:84%
But we expect to see devilish
monsters or dark apparitions

01:11:14.907 --> 01:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
when you think of a
demon, kind of like what

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.200 align:middle line:90%
you'd see in the cinema.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But our demons are really the
people in our everyday lives,

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
the people that we
argue with, the people

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that we envy or hate, the ones
we physically or emotionally

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
harm in some way,
shape, or form.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
we envy or hate

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
qualities in these
specific people as much

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
as we hate the fact that
they remind us of ourselves.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
They reflect qualities
about ourselves

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that we wish we had
more of or that we

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:47.650 align:middle line:90%
wish we didn't have at all.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We alleviate that pain,
not by fixing or fighting

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
our own demons, but by
harming the people that

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
remind us of our demons, by
harming the people that remind

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
us of the things that we
don't like about ourselves.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we become
frustrated that we're not

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
in control of our emotions
because we don't really

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
know what's affecting
our emotions,

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.980 align:middle line:90%
we take it out on others.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
We take it out on
absolutely anything else

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that can show us or act as
a catalyst for our hatred.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So we do the same
thing to animals.

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Animals are perfect because
they can't defend themselves.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect catalyst
for our inner aggression,

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:28.880 align:middle line:90%
our confusion, our hatred.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Just take it out on something
absolutely helpless.

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine how
unconscious a person

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
has to be of his or
her actions to torture

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:42.545 align:middle line:84%
or mutilate or brutalize
any living thing.

01:12:42.545 --> 01:13:20.579 align:middle line:90%
[CRYING]

01:13:20.579 --> 01:13:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.910 align:middle line:90%


01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, bit you.

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] tail [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>He's a big guy.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.480 align:middle line:90%


01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Think of the
lack of compassion

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
you must have towards
life in general

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel no
semblance of sympathy

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.650 align:middle line:90%
towards entire populations.

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Let alone just individuals
or individual animals,

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
entire populations of species
that are bred specifically

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.670 align:middle line:90%
for the purpose of commodity.

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what's even
more dangerous, is not so much

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:53.994 align:middle line:84%
the people carrying
out this cruelty,

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
because that's already
been established.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
That form of hatred and cruelty
has already been established,

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's already known.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
What I'm really worried
about is the people who

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
are against
inhumanity, the people

01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
who are against animal cruelty,
and feel self righteous enough

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
to think that it's justified
to inflict harm or even

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.040 align:middle line:90%
wish harm on these people.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Because those are the people who
take unconscious cruel behavior

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to a whole new level of
conscious cruel behavior

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that's perfectly
acceptable in their minds

01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
that it's their job

01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
to bring other
people to justice.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Like they're an authority
figure of some sort.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people who
will have a much harder time

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
figuring out why they
harbor so much inner hatred

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.962 align:middle line:90%
and resentment.

01:14:38.962 --> 01:14:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to
realize that it's just

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:43.200 align:middle line:84%
another form of the
same exact hatred.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So to keep from facing our
inner demons consistently,

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.630 align:middle line:90%
what do we do?

01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
We begin to realize,
hey, wait a minute.

01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not all
right to inflict harm

01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:54.190 align:middle line:90%
on any other living thing.

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Then the ego has to come up with
a more esoteric form of cruelty

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to trick us into
displaying the same form

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:03.219 align:middle line:84%
of self hatred, the
same indignant attitude,

01:15:03.219 --> 01:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
but just in another way
and towards another group

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.970 align:middle line:90%
of people.

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But the emptiness will
always find a way back in,

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and people will always start to
feel restless again, no matter

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
how many times
they transfer blame

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to yet another person
or yet another group.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:20.440 align:middle line:90%
We need chaos in our lives.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.970 align:middle line:90%
We crave destruction.

01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:24.570 align:middle line:90%
We beg for catastrophe.

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't
have these things to act

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
as a form of exorcism
or a catalyst for us,

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
we start to notice these
things in ourselves.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we don't want.

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:37.110 align:middle line:90%
See, we can deal with wars.

01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
We can deal with terrorism.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We can deal with stock market
collapse and economic collapse.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.210 align:middle line:90%
We can deal with these things.

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But once we start to notice
this chaos within ourselves,

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're
really afraid of.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We'll take a million
September 11's over one moment

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.347 align:middle line:84%
of true insight
towards our self hate.

01:15:55.347 --> 01:16:11.750 align:middle line:90%


01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the most
interesting part of all this

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is we encounter
things every day,

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
every single day, that we
either accept with open arms

01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:24.074 align:middle line:90%
or that we reject violently.

01:16:24.074 --> 01:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
part is not really

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
what we're accepting
or rejecting as much

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
as what it is
inside us that makes

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
us feel compelled
to a certain thing

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
or repelled from
a certain thing.

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
There's this fundamental
dual behavior

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.400 align:middle line:84%
of muscular strength
or weakness, attraction

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.775 align:middle line:90%
or repulsion.

01:16:42.775 --> 01:16:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about this

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is, when you realize that
consciousness, awareness,

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that intangible essence
that animates all matter

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
into what we see
around us as life,

01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that is where you will find the
origin of this dual behavior.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It's been explained is the
inhalation and exhalation

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
of Brahma, the contraction
and expansion of Ahriman

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and Lucifer in an
anthroposophical setting.

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:10.420 align:middle line:10%
The active and the
passive qualities

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:13.440 align:middle line:10%
in electricity, the masculine
and feminine qualities,

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.620 align:middle line:10%
yin and yang, existence
and nothingness.

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.600 align:middle line:84%
These are all ways to explain
the same behavioral process

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that begins with awareness,
begins with consciousness.

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you get rid
of all the images

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and concepts in our minds of
these sayings in your head

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and just try to feel the
difference between the two

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.330 align:middle line:84%
polarities, you'll
begin to notice that all

01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
the different scenarios
and possibilities that

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
are playing out in the world all
spawn from this common origin.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.380 align:middle line:90%


01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a million
people telling you

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
why the Bible is
supposedly the word of God

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and that you should
follow it word for word.

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
have another million

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
claiming that it's a form
of mind control and not

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.150 align:middle line:90%
to believe any of it.

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody will tell
you to be aware of this

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.720 align:middle line:90%
or watch out for that.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.000 align:middle line:90%
This is good information.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
This is bad information.

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
wonder, what makes

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
anyone an authority
figure enough to say

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.080 align:middle line:90%
that something is true or false?

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And why are you denying
or accepting anything

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
based on the suggestion
of another person?

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't you making that
decision for yourself?

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Information is information.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as
good or bad information.

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's all what you do with it.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I say let everything
be your Bible.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Give every piece of information,
every person, every event

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.370 align:middle line:84%
or scenario or situation,
an honest and open mind.

01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because then it's
your responsibility

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to respond to it in the
way that you choose.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Not following the herd,
not following convention.

01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's your responsibility.

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point when, no
matter how many people tell you

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
you're wrong or
right, you're not

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:51.120 align:middle line:90%
dependent upon their approval.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.560 align:middle line:84%
If we at least question
our own actions,

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
question our own
thought process,

01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and make a conscious
decision to what we feel

01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.550 align:middle line:84%
is right every
single day, that's

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:03.000 align:middle line:90%
what I believe to be divinity.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.390 align:middle line:90%
That's true shamanism.

01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:08.075 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is what it
really feels like to be alive.

01:19:08.075 --> 01:19:15.140 align:middle line:90%


01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>In this conscious,
living universe,

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
there are no laws of
nature, just habits.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
external to the universe

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.200 align:middle line:90%
to enforce a law upon it.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The illusion of a
fixed law of nature

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
is only the result
of there being

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
no need for that
habit to be broken.

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
When habits need to
be broken to ensure

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.950 align:middle line:84%
the survival of the organism,
we see this event in nature

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:40.300 align:middle line:90%
and call it evolution.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
The collective mind
shapes our evolution.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And a great example of
this is the experiment

01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:49.200 align:middle line:90%
done by John Cairns in 1988.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
His team put lactose intolerant
cells in an environment

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.790 align:middle line:90%
with only lactose for food.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Under a law of nature, every
one of these lactose intolerant

01:19:58.330 --> 01:19:59.680 align:middle line:90%
cells would have died.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But surprisingly,
they all survived.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them understood the
problem that they were facing

01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and replaced the
defective lactase enzyme

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
with a functioning one to
utilize lactose for food.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.910 align:middle line:84%
If a cell has the ability to
decide how and when to evolve

01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's facing
extinction, then anything can.

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>The existing beliefs
are that a human body

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
is a biochemical machine
controlled by genes.

01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the behavior,
emotions, and character

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
of our biology, our
health, our lives,

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
are controlled by genes,
which we don't control.

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
we taught people.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.260 align:middle line:90%
You're a victim.

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Genes control your life.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.175 align:middle line:90%
You didn't pick them.

01:20:38.175 --> 01:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
You can't change them.

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The genes you end up with
program what's going to happen.

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
My experiments on
stem cells, which

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I started in 1967, I'd
isolate one stem cell,

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.110 align:middle line:90%
put it in a Petri dish.

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
divide every 10 hours.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So I took all the cells, split
them up into three groups,

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and then just put them
in three Petri dishes.

01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I changed the growth
medium, the constituents

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of the environment, in
each of the three dishes.

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
In one dish, the
cells formed bone.

01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
The second dish,
they formed muscle.

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:12.440 align:middle line:84%
In a third dish, they
formed fat cells.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.795 align:middle line:84%
What controlled
the fate of a cell?

01:21:15.795 --> 01:21:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing you
have to say is, wait,

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
they were all
genetically identical

01:21:19.190 --> 01:21:20.790 align:middle line:90%
when they were put in a dish.

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So obviously the genes
didn't control it

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
because they all
had the same genes.

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
What was different
was the environment.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, in my
career, it's like, oh my gosh.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, teaching
genes control life,

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and the cells are telling
me, genes respond to life.

01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And since you can
control the response,

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.897 align:middle line:90%
you can control your life.

01:21:39.897 --> 01:21:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It's how you read
the environment, how

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
your mind perceives
the environment.

01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
this, then you

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
could lead yourself to the
most wonderful expression

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, to be fully
alive and fully healthy,

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:52.495 align:middle line:84%

respond to the world.

and an ever-growing feeling of
being lost and void of meaning,

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%

It happens in spurts and fits.

01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It comes about due
