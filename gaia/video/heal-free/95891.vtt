00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
(Steve Kroschel) Lightning,
the Northern Lights,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:84%
the Moon and every force of
nature gifts the surface of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%
the Earth with energy.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Mankind has had a sense of
this all the way back

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:90%
to the Stone Age.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I live in the Alaskan
wilderness and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
recently learned of this
powerful energy myself.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
(Howard Straus) He has made
one of the most significant

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
health discoveries
of all time.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
One man re-discovered
this secret that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
was to change my
hometown forever.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
A grounding rod
and a wire is all it took,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to personally test whether
this was too good to be true.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone takes off
their shoes and connects to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, a profound change
takes place, immediately.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything's
all interconnected.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Anecdotal evidence
doesn't prove anything.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
They call it
'Earthing' or 'Grounding.'

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Scientific testing occurs
all over the world.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to our blood
cells is just the beginning.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Earthing has the
profound power to enable our

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
bodies to become resilient
to toxic food we eat,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
air we breathe and
water we drink.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Even electrical pollution
can lose its damaging sting,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:90%
if we are grounded.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Physicists and
medical doctors studied the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
stream of data and scratched
their heads in amazement.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
(Rocky) I can say it's the
everyday Joe that's gonna need

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
this more than the guy that's
got millions of dollars.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) How much
money do you have?

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Zilch.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Has your
back gotten better?

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I have absolutely
no pain in my back, whatsoever.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
...and now long term, I don't
have pain, at all, anymore.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
...and I noticed that I
was sleeping

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.329 align:middle line:84%
better, I had a
deeper sleep...

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
...I used to not be
able to just reach up.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It transformed how
local hotel operators did

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
business - but then
came the skeptics.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
(Young Woman) We understand
you have created a website

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:90%
called Skeptoid.com?

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I can't say I've heard anyone
say they had a health benefit.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
(Dave Olerud)
I walked 30 feet today!

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. James Ochsman) Penicillin
was a revolution in medicine.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a revolution
in healthcare that

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:90%
transcends penicillin.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
The Earth knew what
the patients needed!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
(Taxi Driver) What are you here
for? Business? Or Pleasure?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Oh, a little bit of both. I'm
here to get together with some

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
fellow colleagues of mine who
are passionate about Earthing.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
...to help them
be heart-healthy...

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
...it's just uncanny how
fast people heal.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the most sensitive
indicators of changes in

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's field environment
is the human heart.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Top medical experts
from around the world banded

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
together to further the
scientific research,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
in an effort to
revolutionize healthcare

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and save the environment
in the process.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
(Man) Why's everybody barefeet?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Why
is everybody barefoot?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra) Well, do
you want to answer that one?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
(David Suzuki) We need to be
connected with the Earth,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
which gave us birth!

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
(Martin Zucker) It's such a
simple and so profound and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.409 align:middle line:84%
powerful concept - and it's
right there, beneath our feet.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.159 align:middle line:84%
(Clint Ober) If
there is a message,

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
at all about Earthing, it
really is about our connection

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
with nature, with the
planet, with the universe.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Scientists can now
see forms of this energy

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Earth's vibrational power can
re-arrange grains of sand,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
which suggests nothing
in nature is random.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The world's greatest
heroes are oftentimes

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
visionaries - and for
one Apollo Astronaut,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
he was determined
to learn more,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
when he showed up
at my doorstep.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
(Edgar Mitchell) Is this a
wire that's connecting it?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Christy Garner) Yeah. it's
a wire,and there's a mesh.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes really
distinct over time.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
This poor little sunflower
that's not connected

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:90%
starts to wither and wilt.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And the one that's connected
to the Earth is still

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:90%
vibrant and strong.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, when I look
at this, that the Earth,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
itself has this energy to
give every living creature.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
(Edgar Mitchell) Well, it
certainly would suggest that -

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:90%
certainly would suggest that.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
(TV Newscaster) An Alaskan
filmmaker is shooting a

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
documentary, right
here, in Upstate.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It's about a concept
even the filmmaker says is

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:90%
too good to be true.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
heard of grounding?

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a healing
concept, filmmaker

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Steve Kroschel believes
can change the world.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
This will be part of the
sequel to Steve's documentary,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
'Grounded,' the
documentary that was panned by

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:90%
critics who were skeptical.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Steve says he's out to
prove these critics wrong.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
(Taxi Driver) So, y'all are
you in town, visiting?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra)
We're here to shoot this movie

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and basically to tell
the world about the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
medicinal benefits,
which are absolutely huge.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
All of my life,
I've worked with wild animals,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
many of them orphaned and in
the course of this activity,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I became a documentary
filmmaker,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that tried to reveal
truths about many animals

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that were long misunderstood.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
One of them was the wolverine.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
What scientists
once thought about this

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
animal's physical
characteristics and

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
personality has
changed profoundly over time

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:90%
and on this given day,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
a BBC film crew was
shooting a segment with me,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:90%
furthering that enlightenment.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:84%
They are not vicious,
cold-blooded killers.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
They are, instead, highly
intelligent and playful

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:84%
creatures that prefer to
live as far away from modern

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
civilization's
mess, as possible.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The film crew was
shooting a cutting-edge

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
documentary, called
'Beyond Human'

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and utilized my
cabin as a home base.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
The wolverine's
extremely refined sense of

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
smell is what they
wanted to highlight.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Their olfactory ability is
exceedingly beyond human.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.409 align:middle line:84%
And we've barely
scratched the surface,

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
with understanding
what animals detect,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:90%
in their shrinking world.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:84%
As humans, most
of us have now lost our

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
connection to nature and
now there is a word for it,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
NDD - Nature Deficit Disorder -
and this incompleteness has

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
taken a severe toll on our
mental and physical wellbeing.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the story turns a page.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I had a visitor, who was
from a different world.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Yet, he was lucky.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
He was lucky, because his
father is a medical doctor,

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
a heart specialist,
who could see something

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:90%
most of us could not.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:90%
And because I had this visitor,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.130 align:middle line:84%
another guest arrived,
straight from California,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
who is the host of a radio
show about human health.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
His name is Howard Straus.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
This is the guy
who had Clint Ober,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
the re-discoverer of
Earthing or Grounding,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
on his health broadcast,
a couple of years ago,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:90%
that I had listened to.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And because of that radio
show, it changed my life -

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and my hometown of
Haines, Alaska, for good.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
He was here to do
an on-location interview with

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
my visitor, Step Sinatra,
the son of cardiologist

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Stephen Sinatra.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew the interview would be
challenging from the start,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
because Step was starved for
nature - and didn't want to be

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:90%
in any one spot very long.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I admit it was nice to have
some help with the firewood.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Both of them were
eager to have contact with the

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
orphaned animals, including
Angelika, the moose,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
who wasn't feeling very
good the past few days.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
They brought over
some organic carrots,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:90%
to make friends with her.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It was time for breakfast

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
- and what was on the menu
was a prescription.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
A prescription straight
from the pages of a book,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
written by Dr. Max Gerson;
an MD that succeeded in curing

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
cancer, almost a
hundred years ago,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
with a famous cancer
therapy or, rather,

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
infamous cancer therapy
depending on one's point of

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
view since the trick to
it's success is not drugs but

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
basically diet, which
emphasizes juicing organic

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:90%
vegetables in a special way.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Howard Straus is
Gerson's grandson.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew that Step
Sinatra liked to connect to

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, with his bare feet,
as much as possible

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and so do I, for that matter.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I realized
that by this time,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
no sane grizzly wanted
to be, dare I say,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:90%
barefoot in November.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only option was
to go into the Earth,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle line:84%
where it was warm
and comfortable.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I fashioned an open ended
culvert into a den

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:90%
as well for humans, that is.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It is here, that Howard
was able to continue his

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
on location interview,
for his radio show,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
'The Power of
Natural Healing.'

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:84%
(Howard Straus) You have
attributed Earthing

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:90%
to saving your life.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
(Step Sinatra) It kind of goes
along with my new philosophy,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
now, after everything
that I've been through,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that nature has a
cure for everything.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
God talked to me.
It was incredible.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And God said something so
simple, yet it was profound,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and He said,
'Do you want to be here?'

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:84%
By be here, you mean,
On Earth and alive.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Exactly.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I lived such a complex life,
I chased after a lot of

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
material type things
and like I said before,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that was not the answer.
It got me to the wrong place.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm gravitating
back towards nature;

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
towards the laws of nature,
towards the principles of

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine,
where nature is your healer

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and your teacher.
Like I said before,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
nature has a cure for
everything and that's what

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I learned, going through
my entire healing journey.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to see every specialist
that was out there, clinic or

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
therapy, or whatever it was
because I had the resources.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And all those led
me to nothing.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Still ill health.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And really, the journey is
that I had to go deep.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I had to go within myself and
realize that the healing

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:90%
is from above.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
As above, so below is
from the spiritual aspect

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
say God, and that's it.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever everybody else
may think that may be,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:84%
it's all personal but
there's an intelligence that

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
is beyond us and connecting
with that; feeling that love,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that's healing and
that is nature.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Step Sinatra defines
his previous life as

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
one where the bottom line
was all that mattered.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
He worked as a
Wall Street trader,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:84%
but eventually also traded in
his health, inadvertently.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps his illness
ultimately became

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:90%
his greatest gift.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:90%
When his father, Cardiologist

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Sinatra started
a desperate search

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
with Step for the cause
of his lost health;

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:84%
he discovered a
few key factors.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
The two main ones were
that his diet lacked proper

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:84%
nutrition and he walked
around with cellphones;

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
sometimes one on each
ear, day in and day out.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Many people are sensitive to
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
For these people, devices that
label the word Smart as part

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of the product ID are
anything but that.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But Step's recovery did more
than give him back his life.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
He had an epiphany and it
opened his heart and his mind.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
(Step) OK, so I'm in
the hospital and the main

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
doctor walks in and
eight other doctors,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
in white coats
surround my hospital bed.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Ten minutes before that, I'd
almost choked to death because

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I was so weak, I was 83 pounds,
I could hardly breathe.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The doctor says, telling all
the other doctors, he goes,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
'This young man has a 1% chance
of living through the night.'

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
- One percent chance?
- Yes.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And my family's in the room,
they're crying and I said to

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
myself, at that moment,
I go, Oh, my gosh!

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
This was my worst fear.
I can't believe I created this!

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it was like I was in
a movie and I realized that I

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:90%
had created my worst fear.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
So, the epiphany was this,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
a split second after
that, I said, Wow, well,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
if I created that, then I can
create my wildest dreams.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a time, not
too long ago that I wanted

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to see, with my own eyes, the
documented proof of his past

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and it took me right to the
doorstep of his mother, Susie.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I was then led to reunite
with Dr. Laura Koniver,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to independently
evaluate his health profile.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Step's health deterioration,
at society's current disregard

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
for basic biological
laws is not unique.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact some experts say that
the majority of us are now

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
caught up in some
kind of health crisis,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that is linked to
environmental factors,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
whether we realize it, or not.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
To live a healthy life,
does not mean one has

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to deprive themselves
of tasty food and drink.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And before Step and
Howard left my cabin,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
we all experienced that fact.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the wine should
be made from grapes that

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
aren't heavy laden with
pesticides and chemicals and

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the same goes, all
the way down the line,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
from the turkey
to the potatoes.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But if our diet is
less than optimal,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
inflammation of the body
can be a consequence. And yet,

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Earthing or Grounding can
still help put out the fire.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Surely, there must be
a lot of people who stay at

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the Eagle's Nest Motel
that don't eat right,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
yet something is going on
with them; because now,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:84%
ALL the rooms at the Eagle's
Nest Motel are grounded

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:84%
because the
public demanded it.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Splitting firewood in the
dark is asking for trouble

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
but from personal
experience,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the difference of having a
broken body for a day

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to a week rests in
connecting to the Earth by way

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
of a single wire, connected to
a grounding rod in the Earth,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:90%
under a pile of snow.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine
what the implications are,

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
if this if this ever catches
on to what's possible.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I recovered fast enough to
follow Step Sinatra to

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Vancouver, where he was
visiting his brother, Drew and

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
his family. This was a place
to gain a broader perspective.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) So,
what's he doing?

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Step's routine in the morning;

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.400 align:middle line:84%
it's his way of grounding;
it's his way of centering.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
He does a load of the Chi Gong
exercises, with his arms,

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice him doing that
and it's his way of really

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:84%
building energy. It's building
Chi, it's building sustenance.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) And he's
barefoot and he's grounded.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
He's barefoot and
he's grounded.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:90%
He loves it when he does it.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.580 align:middle line:84%
If you ever try these particular
exercises, you'll feel sort

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of vibrant; you'll almost
feel this energy in your hands.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Step and Drew
Sinatra know where to go

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:84%
barefoot in the city.
Sidewalks made of cement

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
are conductive and are
like walking on the Earth.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Whereas asphalt, which is
what city streets and

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
most highways are made out
of, has a chemical makeup

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
which is nonconductive.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Step was holding onto the
water faucet while shaving,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
for a reason because the pipes
and water line are grounded.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Even taking a bath takes
on a whole new perspective.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
When Step and Drew took me
along to meet a patient

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
at Drew's clinic,
they introduced

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
me to a meter they
use, which,

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to my amazement, was able
to read electromagnetic

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
pollution emanating from power
lines and cell phone towers,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
which clearly proved
that it existed.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
(Drew's Patient) It
was over a year ago,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'd gone to see a
girlfriend who was extremely

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
sick and all those doctors
couldn't diagnose her,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
so we took her for a walk in
her wheelchair and we went

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
over the overpass, into the
park area and all of a sudden,

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I was like, Oh my God!
You guys? Is it raining?

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it raining...knives?
The noise..

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
(Drew) You were beneath
the power lines.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
For me. Not everyone else felt
that but for me, it was like,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get out of
here, because it hurt.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It physically was
hurting my skin.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
current society is bathed

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
24/7 in this electro smog, the
best way to deal with this

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
fact is through
grounding and nutrition.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In the case of this patient,
she was receiving a vitamin

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:90%
cocktail, intravenously.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Just outside Vancouver in
Victoria, British Columbia,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I met up with Step and Drew's
father, Dr. Stephen Sinatra.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Although he was
using a cellphone,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
he was also barefoot
at the same time,

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
to counteract the effects.
Dr. Sinatra was in Victoria

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to address the issues
surrounding this subject.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Nice to
meet you, Dr. Black!

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
(Martin Black) Oh,
good afternoon.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And what are you going
to be doing, today here?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
There will be a meeting,
and a number of us will

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
be discussing various aspects
of the electromagnetic field

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
pollution that's been pervading
this country, and then,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
the world, the last few years.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, most people don't
believe that there's any danger.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to that?

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, they don't
believe that because

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
they don't feel it but there
are meters around that feel it,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
there are small animals
around that feel it and they

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:90%
let you know by not surviving.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Small animals?
Even insects?

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Even insects.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Can you give an example?

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:90%
There was a study I read,

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
actually a few days ago and
it was published in July in

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Greece, where somebody had the
students raise fruit flies.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember, fruit flies
were the experimental animal,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
from whom we started to learn
about chromosomes and genes;

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the very famous experiments,
done in the Fly Room at

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Columbia University.
Anyway, he did this,

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:84%
having the flies exposed
to different kinds of gadgets,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
all the different
gadgets that we have,

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
maybe a dozen of them.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the matter is
that it interfered with them

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and the eggs many of
the eggs didn't survive.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the
exposed insect eggs were

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
damaged, compared
to the controls.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you don't
have to ask the insects,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
they tell you by
just not surviving.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
There are literally
thousands of published

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:84%
independent studies,
worldwide that warn of

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
reproductive abnormalities
and DNA damage.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Even cell phone manufacturers
have warnings but most

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
people don't read the fine
print that that comes with

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:90%
these personal gadgets.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I do not own a
phone for several reasons.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
One of which is that there is
no reception where I live.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And in making
this documentary,

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
it was becoming
increasingly difficult to

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
actually find a pay phone.
They are disappearing fast.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, society changes
according to an economic plan,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
for better or for worse and
history has shown us that

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
hindsight is 20/20.
Personally, I look at EMFs as

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
a kind of soft kill.
But necessary, I guess.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
No one is going to throw out
these electronic gadgets,

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
anymore than we're going
to stop driving cars,

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:84%
because they burn poisons that
obviously aren't healthy.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. David Suzuki gave
me a better perspective.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. David Suzuki) We have come
to think that our bottom line,

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:90%
is determined by economics.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Economics is a
human created entity.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not some magic
force of nature,

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly
comes upon us and

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
we've got to bow down before
it but we've created the

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:84%
economy as if it's
some kind of thing,

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:84%
here that we're all here
to service. The reality is,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
we have forgotten that
we are biological creatures.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) And you are an
Electronics Engineer,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
is that right?
- Yes.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And you work in
Silicon Valley?

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And I described to
you what grounding is about

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and what did you
think of that?

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
need to see data

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and if it is reproducible
and if there is data

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to back it up...

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The only way that
I'm able to leave Alaska for

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:84%
brief periods of time is
because I can rely on one man,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Rocky Seward.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Rocky is another example of
someone who's suffered from

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:84%
health issues that melted
away because of Earthing.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I tested one
of those meters

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
in my cabin and was relieved to
see that it read minus 65,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
which is the best
reading one can have.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
The first documentary
about Grounding,

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and how it helped the
residents of my hometown,

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
was having its first premiere.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The only problem was,
there was a snowstorm brewing.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
(Steve Kroschel)
This town is unique.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
People in this place are
interested in doing

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:90%
something adventurous.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Now, you're an
electrician and some people

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
say that Earthing makes you
sick that if you go barefoot

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
on the earth, that there
could be stray voltage.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And that it could
make you sick.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to that?

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
No, the Earth is grounded,
you're not grounded.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:90%
You can't get sick from that.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) All right, how long
have you been an electrician?

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Fifty years.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:90%
My company is Hertz Electric.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And then
there was Dave Olerud,

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
who not only recovered the
ability to walk again but

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
recently had open
heart surgery

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to repair a congenital
heart defect.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, the
doctors and his family

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
feared that it would
have killed him,

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:84%
right on the
operating table.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
(Dave Olerud) Once you
look at the evidence,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:90%
there you see it?

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And this, if you notice,
is where I plug myself in,

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:90%
every time I lay down.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) What do the
doctors say about this belt

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:90%
that you wear?

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.240 align:middle line:84%
(Dave Olerud)
They were doctors.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say anything
positive or negative.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't
plug myself in,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:90%
when I was in the hospital.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think they
hear all kinds of stories.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you conquered what
you did, as a paraplegic,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
he said, you can
conquer this, too.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I had a beautiful wife
and family to help me...

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) The doctors
were they surprised?

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
The last time I
went up there,

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:84%
we had a checkup and
we went up last Fall,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor evaluated me
and he had nothing but a smile

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:90%
on his face.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:90%
He said, That's a miracle.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
No matter where I looked,
people were transformed.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Take my associate,
Mario Bonassi,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
who works with birds of prey.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:84%
His life dramatically
changed, which of course,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
also helped the snowy
owl, indirectly.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And what better
way to celebrate,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:84%
than to play Santa Claus, and
deliver grounding resources to

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
those that slipped on the ice
or couldn't sleep or had a

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
spouse that was
desperate...

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.530 align:middle line:84%
the list of people
runs off the page.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:84%
When I stop and think
about it, Mother Nature,

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
in her vast silence, speaks
volumes to me, sometimes.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I see a beautiful energy, when
one directly connects to her

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that makes a human being's
spirit soar. And this soul

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
shine seems to manifest itself
in all life, everywhere.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Children from all
over the country began to

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
write me, after hearing
about how I would do tests,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
with cut sunflowers in vases
and ground one

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and not the other.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
For this young girl, the
results were worth a ribbon.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't long
before this idea of grounding

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
plants branched out in our
community with an herb that

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:84%
fuels scorn, hatred, confusion
but yet, hope for many.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
For one resident of Haines,
Alaska, he wouldn't let frozen

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
ground deter him from a test
that he wanted to do with me.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So, he stuck a grounding rod
in a tree and then ran a wire

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
into his little
garden in the house.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to verify the potted
plants he selected for this

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
trial were indeed grounded.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, we tested the
connection from the tree with

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
a separate Ground
from his water faucet.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I stuck two flags in
the potted plants that were

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
grounded to see
what would happen,

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
over two weeks and three days.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the plants, that was
ungrounded, in the back,

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:90%
had a seven day head start.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Surely, as they all
grew together,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:84%
their leaves
started to touch each other,

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.550 align:middle line:84%
giving the entire
garden a boost of power.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Even so, running a ruler
across the tops of the whole

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:84%
garden, verified the
two grounded plants.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Growing cannabis
is legal in Alaska and I've

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
personally seen its astounding
medicinal effects on those

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.400 align:middle line:84%
sent home to die by
allopathic medicine.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the resin that
does the trick,

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:84%
when ingested by the walking
dead that gives them

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:90%
their life back.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I've personally
followed these miracles,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
through the work of Dr.
Jeffrey Hergenrather,

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:84%
who demonstrates hope,
health and life, everyday.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Grounding is part of nature's
recipe for keeping us truly

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
alive. We need to be
grounded now more than ever,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because our present
culture seems oblivious

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.930 align:middle line:90%
to basic biology.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:84%
In favor of shortsighted,
unsustainable economic gain.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I find it
absolutely amazing that

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:84%
virtually all indigenous
people clearly understood

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:84%
how connecting to the Earth
meant being truly alive.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But presently, being grounded
takes on a deeper significance.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Countless studies have proven
that a diet filled with

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified food
is not good for humans and

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:90%
creates inflammation.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Grounding can help
significantly but if

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.440 align:middle line:84%
consumed in large amounts
by a sensitive wild animal,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
a tipping point
can be reached,

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:90%
for which nothing can be done.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
After Marge the
moose died in late Fall,

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I discovered in research,
that a pellet that I was

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
feeding Angelika and Karen,
as a supplement to wild

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
browse contained
genetically modified Corn.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I was tempted to
continue feeding it,

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
till I looked
into Karen's eyes.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was already
too late for Angelika.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:90%
How could I have done this?

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Was it really the Genetically
Modified food, called GMOs,

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
or something else?
I needed to be sure.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It would take me all the
way to New York City

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to listen to one of the
world's foremost authorities

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and researchers on the
subject, Jeffrey Smith.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I entered a lecture he
was giving on this

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:90%
agricultural nightmare.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.870 align:middle line:84%
(Jeffrey Smith) RoundUp is
now being sprayed on wheat,

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:84%
on barley, on rye, on
potatoes, on citrus,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
on berries, as a
ripening agent.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're going to avoid
GMOs, also switch to Organic,

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
because Organic does
not allow RoundUp.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.510 align:middle line:84%
These are testicles
that changed from

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:84%
pink to blue, in rats
that were fed GM soy.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
If GMOs were causing
these problems,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:90%
why would we not see them?

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:90%
No one is looking.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no postmarketing
surveillance.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I related the moose tragedy
to Jeffrey for his insight.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:84%
(Jeffrey Smith) We've seen a
lot of evidence of livestock

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and wild animals, certainly
avoiding GMOs when given a

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.920 align:middle line:84%
choice so, it would be
interesting to

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:90%
try that experiment.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But also, of getting better
when taken off of GMOs.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
We've heard a cattle feed
operation showed a lower death

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.480 align:middle line:84%
rate, when the GMO
corn was removed.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about, we've
seen certain organ lesions in

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
animals fed GMOs, whether in
the farm or in the laboratory.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It was at this point, that
I started to introduce some

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
good news, in the middle
of all this bad news.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't Haines, Alaska,
anymore but I discovered

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
quickly, that the people
were no different.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:84%
As fate would have it, the
'Grounded' movie that premiered

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in Haines was suddenly
in the national spotlight,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:84%
about to premiere
in New York City.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And Howard Straus was set to
record another on-location

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.530 align:middle line:84%
radio segment for
his health program.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:84%
This time, he met with
earthing advocate, Dr. Laura

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Koniver and her two children
for a segment in Central Park.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Koniver homeschools her
two children and utilizes

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
these types of travels
for homeschool lessons.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.420 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Laura Koniver) earthing's
one of the most ancient healing

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:84%
modalities of all time, so
it's the easiest for more

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
patients to align with.
I've seen everything from

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
weight loss, to pain
reduction, to sleeping better.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I've had patients, literally
say that they have a tree

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:84%
that's on their balcony that
they can touch the branch of

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's rooted in the
ground below. They sit there

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
on the balcony reading while
touching that for ten minutes

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and it makes a difference
in their life, so yeah.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Koniver went from
one radio program to

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:84%
another, with her
message of healing.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Laura Koniver)
All of your free radicals,

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
any kind of inflammatory
things that you've got,

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:84%
starting to built up, it's
starting to wash it away, now.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Before long, I had Howard
helping me hand out crumpled

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
paper bags of Earthing
resources to these city folk.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:90%
It was Déjà vu.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:84%
While staying in the big city,
I switched to a more civilized

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
way to ground,
even myself at night.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But first, I needed to check
the grounding port in a wall

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.719 align:middle line:84%
socket, to ensure the
building was properly wired.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Older buildings,
before the 1970s,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
did not always have a good
ground. For this reason,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.270 align:middle line:84%
a grounding rod is often
necessary. I was in luck.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The wiring was updated
in this old hotel.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Earth's energy
could flow into the

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:84%
conductive fibers of the pad,
if my skin made contact.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
(Howard Straus) So, I had
a conversation with Laura

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:84%
Koniver and she said that she
did a little mini study with

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
her obesity patients;
that they were all women.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
60% of them lost
weight, as she expected.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:84%
40% of them did not.
But those 40%, when she

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:84%
looked into it more deeply,
had more serious ailments.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And the more serious
ailments DID clear so,

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.970 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the body took
care of the most dangerous

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:84%
things first; the most
life threatening things first,

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:84%
leaving the
obesity for later.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Howard was now recording
Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez,

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
who explains his experience
with an Earthing resource.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:78%
(Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez)
The best way to describe
about the way I felt is that,

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I felt extremely toxic and
poisoned. I couldn't sleep

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.580 align:middle line:84%
at all. I felt irritable.
I developed terrible itching.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:78%
(Howard) First of all,
I'm wondering what kind
of welling do you live in?

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
(Nicholas) I live in a
pre-World War II apartment,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.250 align:middle line:84%
so it's there are
no synthetics in it.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:84%
(Howard) Dr. Gonzalez,
thank you for joining us.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Howard, it's always great to
see you and it's always

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:84%
great to talk with you and
have stimulating discussions.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It was the opening
night of the theatrical

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:84%
release of
'The Grounded' documentary.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Howard had yet another
segment to record,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.560 align:middle line:84%
for his radio program,
with Step Sinatra's father,

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Cardiologist,
Dr. Stephen Sinatra,

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
in the projection
room, in the theater.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra) I've
interviewed hundreds of people

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:84%
who are grounded. Not everyone
has a pleasant experience.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all, people
can have a detox reaction.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Where they're earthing and
they're getting that energy

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:84%
through the body and you know,
this could activate parasites,

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:12.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe the live spirochete;
activate microbes.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But remember, even though they
had an undesirable situation,

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:84%
like leg cramps; for
example, remember this,

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that when you do Earth,
when you do Ground,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.390 align:middle line:84%
you could be
detoxing the body.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So, then you bring the body
to a level, where it has

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit worse,
before it gets better.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Even my assistant back
home in Alaska, Rocky,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:84%
was able to read the reactions
from the film critics to

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.290 align:middle line:84%
'The Grounded' documentary.
It wasn't pretty.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:84%
The New York Times
didn't pull punches.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.430 align:middle line:84%
While considering
the film critic feedback,

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:84%
an acquaintance who advocates
earthing and grounding to a

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
broad audience,
tried to cheer me up,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:84%
with yet another published
scientific, double blind study.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Yet, all I wanted
to do was go home.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.750 align:middle line:90%
(Chain saw)

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:90%
(Steve) Hold that.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe take those things out of
your ear, so you can hear me.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel better, than you
did 24 months ago, Rocky?

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me
what your last name is?

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Seward.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Rocky Seward.
Now, do you feel better?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Are you richer than you
were, 24 months ago?

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean, 'nope.'
How much money do you got?

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Zilch. Not a
dollar to my name.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're rich
in health now, right?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't
look very happy.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Not financially,
I'm not.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe I can change that.
I'm going to go on a trip.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:90%
OK. When are you coming back?

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure yet.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:90%
(Laughs)

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) You don't believe me,
do you?

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.220 align:middle line:84%
There are people in New York
that say they saw this movie

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and they thought it
was a bunch of crap.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Didn't believe it.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to that?

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.900 align:middle line:84%
From experience,
I know that it works.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.820 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Experience,
I know that it works,

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I had sleep apnea
and I don't have any more.

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about other
people in this town?

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a few
people here that were sick

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and had back pain and such
and they're all healed now.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But would film critics
on the West Coast

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.180 align:middle line:84%
see the documentary with
a different perspective?

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:84%
(Howard) Welcome back folks,
this is Howard Straus;

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
'The Power of
Natural Healing,'

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:84%
the guest is
Dr. Gaetan Chevalier.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Chevalier works at...

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:84%
he is faculty at the California
Institute for Human Studies.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, California
Institute for Human Studies.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Human Science. California
Institute for Human Science.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Human Science. Thank
you very much, Dr. Chevalier.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Now here's a
technology that is simple and

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
basically free for anyone,
and yet is one of the most

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.830 align:middle line:84%
powerful techniques
for healing

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.840 align:middle line:90%
that has ever been identified.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Gaetan Chevalier) I started
doing research for Earthing,

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:32.390 align:middle line:84%
with Clint Ober, in 2003, and
it happened at the California

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Institute for Human
Science and at the time,

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I was very skeptical.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:90%
You were not an advocate.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
That's right. But connecting to
the Ground is, to my surprise,

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.490 align:middle line:84%
amazing results, beyond
what I expected, actually.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The first study was an
electrophysiology study.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
We measured brainwaves,
muscle tension, heart rate,

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:06.170 align:middle line:84%
skin temperature and blood
pulse, all these things.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And we also measured
the flow of energy,

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
using a machine that has been
developed by the founder of

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.480 align:middle line:90%
the CIHS; it's called an AMI.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.390 align:middle line:84%
(Howard) This could
have vast implications

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:84%
in the treatment of clinical
depression, I would think.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:84%
(Gaetan) Yes. People with
depression, even people with

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's and also
children with ADD.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We have another study that
is going on, right now,

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:84%
on blood pressure;
how it changes.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We're measuring blood
pressure directly,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to confirm
this, I'm pretty sure.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.290 align:middle line:90%
(Howard) If this technology,

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
which is basically free can
relieve pain better than any

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceuticals that
are sold over the counter and

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that are this huge, multi,
multibillion dollar industry,

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.230 align:middle line:84%
you can see that there would
be a fair amount of commercial

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:84%
jealousy and/or
competition going on.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But I was not here to pat
Dr. Chevalier on the back.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I was here to play the Devil's
Advocate to represent the film

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.030 align:middle line:84%
critics, who lambasted
it all as snake oil

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:90%
and New Age nonsense.

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if this guy
is an expert in electricity.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't sound like it!

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't.
I'd like to see his credentials.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.420 align:middle line:84%
This guy doesn't know
what he's talking about

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and I can demonstrate
that to you.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:84%
(Howard) Now, remember,
Dr. Chevalier used to teach

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:84%
electronics and electrical
engineering students about

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.520 align:middle line:84%
electronics and
electromagnetism.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this person
is saying, here,

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that alternating
electric field,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:84%
present in the environment,
they are radiated from wires,

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:84%
even when there are no
currents flowing through them.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't even begin to imagine
how they can come up

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:84%
with such a thing.
Here it is.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.790 align:middle line:84%
We have a wire that
is just plugged in.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Connected to nothing. Okay?
And we're gonna demonstrate...

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:08.840 align:middle line:84%
(Beeping)
-that it emits EMF. Okay?

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a particularly
sensitive device.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.800 align:middle line:84%
No. This is a device you
can find commercially.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.470 align:middle line:84%
They're very cheap. And there
you go. They do emit EMF.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm sorry, this person
from Skeptoid does not know

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:90%
about electromagnetism.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.360 align:middle line:84%
From California,
I went to South Florida,

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.280 align:middle line:84%
where Step Sinatra's father,
Dr. Stephen Sinatra was

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
spending a relaxing morning
with another doctor,

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:84%
who advocates natural
healing, Dr. Joseph Mercola.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.080 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Joseph Mercola) We know
that Vitamin D is just so

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.790 align:middle line:84%
crucial. The fine point, that
I feel most people fail to

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:84%
appreciate, though, it's not
simply swallowing a pill.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I kind of think that's
the allopathic approach,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.840 align:middle line:84%
the allopathic paradigm,
in that there's a pill for

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
everything. Well, our ancestors
never swallowed Vitamin D pills.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
They got it by exposing a
significant portion of their

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.310 align:middle line:84%
skin to sun, in the
non-winter months,

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.070 align:middle line:84%
unless you lived in a
subtropical environment.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.030 align:middle line:84%
As I listened, I thought
about a man that has

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:84%
carried the torch for
the Native communities,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that always knew
what nature could do,

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:84%
in giving one their life back;
whether it was physical,

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.330 align:middle line:90%
mental or spiritual.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.080 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra) I met
Clint about ten years ago.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I was at a conference
in California.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were sort of in a
trailer, looking at what we call

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.000 align:middle line:90%
(unintelligible)

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:84%
basically,
endothelial cell dysfunction,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:84%
using a blood pressure cuff,
and I met this cowboy and

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:84%
basically, he's talking
about Grounding.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And as a cardiologist,
I've got to tell you;

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I resonated with it, because
the heart's an electrical organ.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
What Dr. Sinatra
and Dr. Mercola find

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.070 align:middle line:84%
as outstanding healing
modalities is exactly what

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:84%
saved Dr. Sinatra's son,
Step from certain death.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was there
to be a witness.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I see lots of cracks now in
the brick wall that allopathic

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.470 align:middle line:84%
medicine has built
to protect larger interests

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and because of
suppressed information,

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:08.310 align:middle line:84%
many people go to their
graves far too early.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Koniver and I had
lots to talk about concerning

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.730 align:middle line:84%
this and I was already
late for that appointment.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.070 align:middle line:84%
When it comes
right down to it,

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:84%
most of what it takes to
maintain your health is free,

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.410 align:middle line:84%
in the form of Grounding.
All one needs is awareness.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.330 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Laura Koniver)
We just have this!

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) What do we
do in a place like this?

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what we
live in; what do we do?

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that there's
a way for us to accept modern

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
technology in our society,
as it is and also,

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.840 align:middle line:84%
still make the time to touch
Mother Earth and find ways to

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.220 align:middle line:84%
connect with Her, even
with this all around us.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're still
living on the Earth,

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.640 align:middle line:84%
so there's still ways to touch
her, connect with her and

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it has to be that
we live that way, constantly,

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it could be that we
take the effort to do that

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.320 align:middle line:84%
every day even if we're
not living directly off her.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Her home schooling
continued and now,

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.530 align:middle line:90%
I too was one of her students.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:84%
(Laura) There's so much sacred
geometry in the human body.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Our human body is full
of sacred geometry.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So, in your ear, the way you
pick up sound is through a

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:84%
sacred spiral that's
right next to your brain.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.380 align:middle line:84%
In the eye, first of all,
the shape of the eye is what?

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.090 align:middle line:84%
(Son) A circle.
(Laura) A circle, yes.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So, here we have a
sensory organ, your eye,

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that's designed to pick up on
what you're seeing and the

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.640 align:middle line:90%
back is called the retina.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.600 align:middle line:84%
There are rod and
cone cells, there.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And wait till you see what
they look like, up close.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.190 align:middle line:90%
See these?

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You see how some are pointy
and some are like sticks?

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.740 align:middle line:84%
They're called that because
of this, a rod and a cone.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look up
close, look at what it really

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.530 align:middle line:84%
is. It's these discs. Stacked
on each other. Beautifully and

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.100 align:middle line:84%
repetitively and with
a geometry to them.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.330 align:middle line:84%
(Daughter) Oh, my goodness!
That's crazy!

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the
back of your retina

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
picks up on light.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Stephen Sinatra
has never stopped his

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.390 align:middle line:84%
pioneering research
into Earthing.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Working closely with
colleague Clint Ober,

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:84%
they continue to break down
barriers in conventional

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.480 align:middle line:84%
medicine that separates
patients from real recovery

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and freedom.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, today, I was on hand
to document a first time

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.200 align:middle line:84%
experiment, which,
if it would work,

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.910 align:middle line:84%
would make history in medical
circles but it if it failed,

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.290 align:middle line:84%
would leave Dr.
Sinatra embarrassed

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:36.040 align:middle line:84%
at best and
confused at worst.

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:39.250 align:middle line:84%
It was the introduction of
Grounding to a diabetic

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.670 align:middle line:84%
patient whose retina
would be photographed before

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and after only two
hours of Grounding.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:49.130 align:middle line:84%
If even the slightest
change could be observed

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
after that time, it
would be groundbreaking news

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and unequivocal,
as to what's possible,

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.730 align:middle line:84%
if Mother Earth is given
a chance to be heard.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sinatra placed
a grounding patch on the

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:84%
bottom of both the
patient's feet and on both

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
palms of his hands.
The Earth would do the rest.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.360 align:middle line:90%
You're grounded!

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.330 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Doctor, how much
more time do we have

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:90%
before we test this patient?

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:90%
About 20 minutes or so.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.090 align:middle line:84%
OK. What are we going
to see, hopefully?

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So, the purpose of this test
and the reason why we do it,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.600 align:middle line:84%
as retina specialists is
called a fluorescein angiogram.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Fluorescein is a
vegetable based dye and we

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:84%
inject it into a patient's
vein through an IV.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And it circulates through the
heart and up to the head and

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.780 align:middle line:84%
into the eye and we can
actually document the blood

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.610 align:middle line:84%
flow in the eye, in the
retina, in particular.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So, the retina is the
photographic film of the eye,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.030 align:middle line:84%
it's no thicker than tissue
paper and it's attached to the

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:84%
inner wall in the back of
the eye and coursing through

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.540 align:middle line:84%
the retina are very
fine blood vessels.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And, so, say, for example,
a patient with high blood

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.000 align:middle line:84%
pressure or diabetes or macular
degeneration, we monitor

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.130 align:middle line:84%
the blood flow in the back
of the eye by doing this test.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.850 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra) I've done
like 3,000 angiograms,

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
so I'm used to reading
angiograms of the heart but

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.980 align:middle line:84%
when I see something like this,
you see this branch coming

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:84%
off here and it's
really lit up over here?

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And there's another branch here,

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.440 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Shalesh Kaushal)
Could that be a difference?

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.440 align:middle line:84%
(Stephen) Yeah, I mean, isn't
that improved blood flow?

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.160 align:middle line:84%
(Shalesh)
It could be, Steve, yeah.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And even off
this tributary, too.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:01.830 align:middle line:84%
(Stephen) Yeah.
You can't see it here

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.450 align:middle line:84%
but there's a beautiful
tributary there.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:06.410 align:middle line:90%
(Shalesh) Yeah, you're right.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.380 align:middle line:78%
(Stephen)
Yeah. Isn't that increased
blood flow to the retina?

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.590 align:middle line:84%
(Shalesh) I was looking at,
concentrating on the macula,

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.340 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
gain in vision.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The macula actually looks
better profused, post Grounding.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you that's pretty
neat because usually when we

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.270 align:middle line:84%
see a distortion of the full
field avascular zone like this

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.690 align:middle line:84%
in diabetics, it gets
progressively larger.

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:33.480 align:middle line:90%
You never see it shrink.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what caught
my attention right away.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.610 align:middle line:84%
(Stephen) And the
fact that these vessels are

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:84%
lighting up more in other
words, can you assume,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.870 align:middle line:84%
if you do have better
profusion of the retina,

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.620 align:middle line:84%
could there be, under
microscopic conditions,

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.130 align:middle line:90%
a profusion of the macula?

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm getting at!

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was saying; the
change in the avascular zone

00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:00.550 align:middle line:84%
or this shrinkage of it,
suggests that there's improved

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
profusion of the macula. That's
really what this is about.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.350 align:middle line:84%
- That's what we want.
- That's the gain.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have one percent
profusion, that's significant.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:11.020 align:middle line:90%
That is gigantic,

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.230 align:middle line:84%
for the photoreceptor
cells that are affected by that.

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's only two hours of
grounding! Less than two hours.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, suppose we did
12 hours of grounding?

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:22.870 align:middle line:90%
That would be interesting.

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:24.830 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) So, doctor, what
does this mean for you?

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Will you do this
with more patients?

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely. This is a very
interesting initial observation

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite exciting because
if we can show as in all good

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.630 align:middle line:84%
science that
it's reproducible,

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and we can improve the
profusion in this instance,

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of a diabetic patient and
other patients that has huge

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.470 align:middle line:84%
implications to the health
of their eye and actually,

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:47.890 align:middle line:84%
the health of
their whole body.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
there is even hope for this

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:90%
patient to regain his sight.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sinatra can also see
significant differences

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.690 align:middle line:84%
between horses
that are grounded.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Then obvious
Golden Ratio in nature is an

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.800 align:middle line:84%
emphasized home school lesson
for Dr. Koniver's children

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.340 align:middle line:84%
because it ties in the
subjects of mathematics and

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.550 align:middle line:84%
science and health and even
social studies all into one,

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:84%
tight curl. It is the
symbol of life, intelligence,

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.350 align:middle line:90%
unity, beauty and hope.

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The more I thought
about it, our architecture,

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:84%
our corporate logos,
our engineering feats,

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.200 align:middle line:84%
even our adventures into
space was based upon this power

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.820 align:middle line:90%
of interconnectedness.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Laura and her children
were now at the home

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:01.760 align:middle line:84%
of Apollo 14 Astronaut
Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mitchell also sees the
power that grounding can

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.930 align:middle line:84%
render and sees that power
from a unique perspective.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.440 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Edgar Mitchell) I want to
point out the hand controller.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the hand
controller I used on Apollo 14.

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:84%
- Wow!
- To land on the Moon.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.970 align:middle line:84%
(Clara) How many interviews have
you had in your life?

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.720 align:middle line:84%
(Edgar) I have no idea! But
into the thousands, I'm sure.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.890 align:middle line:90%
- I'm sure.

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.140 align:middle line:84%
There are few days, when I
haven't been interviewed.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.600 align:middle line:90%
- Wow That's crazy.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, Laura's daughter
Clara, gifted Dr. Mitchell

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.320 align:middle line:84%
with grounding resources
to improve his own health.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So, in some ways, this was
an update and a reunion.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.950 align:middle line:78%
(Clara) What was the most
surprising thing you learned
from standing on the Moon?

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know
that there were

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.870 align:middle line:84%
any great surprises, because
we had practiced and trained;

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:20.170 align:middle line:84%
everything was a
result of training.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Setting up the science
station, out in front,

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.550 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of
equipment that we set up

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that then broadcast data
back to Earth for 14 years.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we have been
visited by alien life forms and

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:38.230 align:middle line:84%
the evidence is overwhelming
that the extraterrestrials

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:41.150 align:middle line:84%
have been coming
here for perhaps centuries.

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:44.940 align:middle line:84%
In our lifetime, the famous
Roswell Incident was the

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:84%
beginning of the Modern Era
but the evidence is pretty

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:55.660 align:middle line:84%
strong and I know all of the-
on a firstname basis have met-

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:59.920 align:middle line:84%
all of the primary investigators
both in Europe, South America

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and the United States that
are the experts in that area.

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Why the Powers that Be
are covering it up or

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:13.810 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep it hidden-
have tried to keep it hidden-

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:16.390 align:middle line:84%
but I suspect that
it's power and control.

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Did what Edgar speak of have
anything to do with Grounding?

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.560 align:middle line:84%
A century ago, if one
suggested that Human would walk

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.900 align:middle line:84%
on the Moon, it would've been
thought of as sheer lunacy.

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Yet, after several failed
attempts, Edgar is only one

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:34.370 align:middle line:84%
of 12 people to ever walk upon
the surface of an alien world.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I see this as a metaphor
for Earthing or Grounding

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and what is suggests is
a new healthcare modality.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Edgar embraces grounding
wholeheartedly.

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Why? Is it based on something
else that he knows?

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:07.150 align:middle line:84%
(Son) Do you see math
equations in the universe?

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.780 align:middle line:84%
(Edgar) Well, I don't
see them I mean, we know,

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.660 align:middle line:84%
we've created a lot of math
equations to describe the

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.700 align:middle line:84%
movement in the universe
and where things are,

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.330 align:middle line:90%
with respect to each other.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.670 align:middle line:84%
(Alison Price) These are
petrochemicals, formaldehyde,

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:29.380 align:middle line:84%
fragrance, toxic
preservatives,

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:32.090 align:middle line:84%
just to name a few and there's
also many that won't appear on a

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.350 align:middle line:84%
label, they're just byproducts
of the manufacturing process,

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that are residues, that are
going to be in that product,

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that will not appear on the
label because it's not an

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:43.100 align:middle line:84%
official ingredient. In my
opinion, it's like, why take

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the risk. I think innately,
we know that these chemicals

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:48.230 align:middle line:84%
should not be present
in our bloodstream.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We're a living study. Right now,
we don't know the health

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.360 align:middle line:84%
impacts about these toxic
chemicals and how they interplay

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with one another and how our
bodies are dealing with them.

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So, The sooner we understand
that life is interconnected and

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.620 align:middle line:84%
cyclical and that our health
is intricately tied to this

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.540 align:middle line:84%
planet, the better. We're
excited about everything that

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:10.550 align:middle line:84%
going on and now without
further ado; Doctor Laura.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.550 align:middle line:90%
(Applause)

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.390 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Laura Koniver) All right,
thanks so much for coming,

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.890 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it so much.

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you a little
bit about how I transitioned

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.770 align:middle line:84%
from living disconnected to
the Earth and not knowing I

00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:28.980 align:middle line:84%
was disconnected to really
embracing how it feels to

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.900 align:middle line:84%
start Earthing and to making
a conscious choice to Earth.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I had my daughter. She's
the one who taught me about

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.120 align:middle line:84%
earthing, really. Clara,
sitting there, in the front,

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and she came into my life and
changed me in a million ways

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.870 align:middle line:84%
but one of the ways
is that she had colic.

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lifechanger,
because she cried constantly.

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:49.040 align:middle line:84%
The only time she's not crying
is when she was nursing,

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.710 align:middle line:84%
basically and pacing
around and eventually,

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I start pacing outside.
I lived in Arizona at the time,

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:84%
so I never wore shoes,
because it's warm, year round.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm pacing outside in
the front yard with my little

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.680 align:middle line:84%
baby girl and every time
I'd do this, she stops crying.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Every time. So, finally, dawning
on me, through sleep deprivation

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that this is the only way to get
her to stop crying, so every day

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.980 align:middle line:84%
we'd go outside and I'd walk,
sing to her and I'd walk,

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and she'd almost always goes
to sleep or something and I'm

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.820 align:middle line:84%
thinking... what? And
the I'd realize, sometimes,

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd have my shoes on
and it wouldn't work. Right?

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Or, I'd go outside and my
daughter would be crying in a

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
fit and I'd have my shoes and
like, why is this not working?

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:27.210 align:middle line:84%
it's not that, it's- I'm
barefoot and she's on my skin,

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.790 align:middle line:84%
on my chest and her skin's
touching my skin and

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm grounded to the earth
and that's the difference.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So, I didn't have a label for
it but I knew, hey, whatever

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
this is, this is really helping,
instantaneously with pain.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm stepping outside and I'm
holding her and nobody's

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
telling her 'You should
be feeling better now.'

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Her autonomic nervous system
is having an instant

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
response to the fact that
it's not inflamed anymore.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Her body is neutralized and
inflammation is decreasing

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and I can see that relief
and I can feel it in her.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So, that's how I started
getting the concept of Earthing.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.350 align:middle line:84%
All we have
to do is touch it.

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And we're Grounded.

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We are providing the
earthing resources to

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
various cancer patients across
the United States to help

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
them with, hopefully, whatever
it is that ails them the most.

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And the feedback that we've
gotten has been pretty amazing.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.790 align:middle line:90%
A lot of pain relief.

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
We have patients who say that
it's relieving their headaches.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been seeing patients
for 17 years, specializing in

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune diseases. Started
using Earthing, Grounding.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) OK, so approximately
what percentage of your patients

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
have a positive result
with Grounding resources

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.020 align:middle line:90%
or being Grounded?

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Easily, 85% to 90%.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Step Sinatra and his
father are dedicated to

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.240 align:middle line:90%
updating healthcare.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
They believe it will improve
the economy and open doors

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that up till now have
been closed and locked.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I was born near
Hinckley, Minnesota and here

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
is where both my parents have
not only experienced the

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
effects of grounding
but have shared it with

01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:45.090 align:middle line:90%
everyone that will listen.

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
(Elsie) Oh, I'm looking
at my pictures. Okey Doke.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Here, we've got the
hunting picture.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Elsie,
how old are you?

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I just turned
98 the 17th of February.

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Have you lived close
to nature your whole life?

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
ALL my life.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
What did you do, in your life?
I mean you picked berries? What?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I did everything that
an ordinary citizen does,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
in their lifetime.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
When my parents introduced
Earthing to the neighbor girl,

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that survived being pinned
by a tractor tire on her face,

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the results she had closed
the door on anyone else's

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
doubts within her family
about what grounding can do.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
First it was her mother.
And then it was her sister.

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been in
Minnesota for two years.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
few people missing.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.279 align:middle line:90%
I knew where to find them.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Did they die
before their time?

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Probably so.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It made me think deeply
about what matters.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Seeing my family name
made me realize that I want

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:56.230 align:middle line:84%
to make every moment count,
before it's gone forever.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.810 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra) We
live in a toxic age.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's
toxicity all around us.

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
There's seen forces, there's
unseen forces and the unseen

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:11.029 align:middle line:84%
forces are worse
than the seen.

01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So, what we're doing,
right now,

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
we're taking in the
energy of the Earth.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
We're balancing,
we're connecting.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
That's it! We're
connecting with the Earth.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need
that's what everybody needs.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
(Step Sinatra)
That's what I really want.

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
(Vanessa de la Vina) So, tell
me a little bit about what

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.420 align:middle line:90%
you guys are working on.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to go
into a retirement home,

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be giving
these Grounding sheets.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Which, I don' know if
anybody's heard about but...

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Laura Koniver)
These blankets have these

01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
stripes in it, and it's
connected to this wire,

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.450 align:middle line:90%
and see this little plug?

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
You can put it in the outlet;
this will help connect,

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
through the outlet, through
the grounding system in the

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
house, when you're outside and
just feel connecting to nature

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
healing for your body.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I can't go outside,
I'm working or I'm on the

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
computer. Or I'm inside.
So, I can so this.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
This will plug in and
connect me to the earth

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
outside and be
supportive of my health.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And people use these
and they sleep with them.

01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you, for hours, sleep
with it or have it on your lap

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're watching
TV or reading,

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
then studies have shown, in
your blood and in your joints,

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and all through your body that
pain is decreased and you

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
sleep better and
that kind of thing.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:13.029 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing to do with the
electricity,

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.070 align:middle line:84%
you're putting it in the
grounding port, right there.

01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I really like the
individual anecdotal

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.120 align:middle line:84%
evidence because that
shows me what's possible.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if something
happens to even one person,

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
then I know that
it's possible for me.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Even if it doesn't
happen to anybody else,

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I have unlimited possibility
but if something happens and

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
it's true for that human
being, and there's that story

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and that truth, then I know
that's possible for anybody.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
(Step Sinatra) So the epiphany
was this; in a split second

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
after that, I said, well,
wow if I created that,

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
then I can create
my wildest dreams.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.439 align:middle line:84%
(Howard Straus) You know, and
this is something that I keep

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:29.359 align:middle line:84%
telling people
over and over again.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:34.609 align:middle line:84%
Disease, cancer, whatever
kind of disease it is, is a

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:38.529 align:middle line:84%
construct of how you live your
life and what you think about.

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:39.779 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And, like in the old Edward
G. Robinson gangster movies,

01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
when he says, 'I made
you and I can break you!'

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
what you're telling us.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
You're telling us,
I made this circumstance,

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I made this bad situation,
I can unmake it and make it the

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
most wild, fantastic
future that there is.

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It was Howard's mother,
Charlotte Gerson,

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
whose father, Dr. Max Gerson,
went down in history as a

01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:29.500 align:middle line:90%
visionary in medicine.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
He was curing cancer
almost 100 years ago, now.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
At that time, no one
listened to him, either.

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:46.059 align:middle line:84%
The Grounding is not very
different from the Gerson

01:09:46.059 --> 01:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Therapy. Grounding is
relatively free of charge.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
The Gerson Therapy is
relatively inexpensive because

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
we're using natural materials
and they can't patent them,

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
so they are against it,
because they can't make

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
a lot of money on it.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Howard Straus is an
MIT Graduate in Physics and

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
wanted to show me a math
equation that manifests itself

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.130 align:middle line:84%
in a design. Perhaps visual
proof of math's expression

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in nature.
The door was open.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And as I stepped in, a flood
of memories came back to me.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
The past two years
have gone by quickly

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was a wakeup call,
as to what I had witnessed.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
(Steve) Get naked
and I felt better.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Anecdotal evidence
doesn't prove anything.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I really like the individual
anecdotal evidence because

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
then I know that that's
possible for anybody.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Stephen Sinatra) Greatest
discovery of all time was what

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
we're doing now,
which is Earthing!

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
(Step Sinatra) There is
intelligence that is beyond us.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
(Dave Olerud)
That's a miracle.

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:48.300 align:middle line:84%
(Son) Do you see math
equations in the universe?

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Edgar Mitchell) We created
a lot of math equations to

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
describe the movement in the
universe and where things are,

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.480 align:middle line:90%
with respect to each other.

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
If there is a message,
at all about Earthing,

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
it really is about our
connection with nature,

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
with the
planet, with the universe.

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.990 align:middle line:90%
(Joseph M. Ritter) Horseshit.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't read these studies
that you're talking about.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the result of
these scientific studies?

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Shalesh Kaushal) As in all
good science reproducible,

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
in this instance, in the
case of a diabetic patient.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. David Suzuki)
Nature is everywhere.

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
(Skeptoid) What I know, for
one thing is that there's a

01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
huge number of madeup, New
Age claims...I can't say I've

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
heard anyone say they've
had a health benefit.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
(Dr. Gaetan Chevalier)
Skeptoid does not know.

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The Schumann Cavity
Resonance, 7.83 Hertz.

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
That is the
heartbeat of the Earth,

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
made visible for the
first time in history.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to be connected with
the Earth, which gave us birth.

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have air for more
than three or four minutes,

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
we're dead! If you don't
have clean water, you're sick.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And the same with the Earth,
it gives us our food,

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the Sun that gives us the
energy in our bodies.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other creatures
around the planet,

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
that make the planet
habitable for us.

01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
If we don't see that
that is the bottom line,

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
for our wellbeing and
happiness, then we're toast!

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
What Howard saw, in
that mathematical sequence

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
discovered by
Benoit Mandelbrot,

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is something considered to
be one of the greatest

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
mathematical
revelations of all time.

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Computers did not create
this neverending design;

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
they revealed it.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Does it carry a message?

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
They say that in all
the snowflakes that have

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
ever fallen, that no
two are exactly alike.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:20.040 align:middle line:90%
We are snowflakes.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
There are billions of us
but we are all unique.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Made with infinite perfection.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And if we embrace each other,
coming together with a shared,

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
sustainable purpose,
born in love,

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the power of that
can move mountains.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can stop it.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I think now,
more than ever,

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for spring.

01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:03.040 align:middle line:90%
