00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I had my own story, just of
my own life, my own upbringing,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
my own background, and divorced
parents and all that type

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:84%
of thing, growing up in
inner city of Los Angeles,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:90%
struggling, all of that.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I was a teenage parent
when I was young.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.535 align:middle line:84%
My son was born like, a
month after my 16th birthday.

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Probably like all
people, there's

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
a time when there is no
money, and then there's money,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and then there's no money again.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of how life works out.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But I remember there was a time
early on there was no money.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.912 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
of that, I really

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be very successful.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to be successful.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.055 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how to do it.

00:00:58.055 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So I continued
learning on my own.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Did tons of training,
attended tons of seminars,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
spent thousands and
thousands and thousands

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.973 align:middle line:84%
of dollars in self-help
on books and seminars.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you name it,
I did it, because I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:90%
wanted to change my life.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And it did work.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Over time, it was just
like building a muscle.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep working it.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I was on a huge upswing.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Business was going great.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Life was great.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I was 25
years old at the time,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was making over a
quarter of a million a year.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I did what any
normal 25-year-old kid would

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I bought cars, and
big screen TVs,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and went to Vegas probably
way too many times,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
more than I had to, but that
was my life at the time.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
At 25 years old, I
was living it up.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I remember I bought
a yellow Ferrari.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I guess I wanted people to
recognize me or pay attention

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget this one
day, I pulled up at a light.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Normally, if you're
in a yellow Ferrari,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:84%
people tend to notice you, and
they weren't looking at me.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.508 align:middle line:84%
And I look over at
the car next to me,

00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
which looked like to be
the husband and the wife,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and there's two kids
in the backseat,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:90%
and they had this little dog.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
The kids were laughing and the
parents are just looking over

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and they just looked like they
were having such a good time,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and I remember, I never
forget this feeling of looking

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:90%
over and being jealous.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, this kid, I'm at
the top of what I thought

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
was my life then, and I
look over at these people,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
probably living a
totally average life,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and I was very jealous of
that, because that was missing.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:90%
My life was nothing--

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:90%
nothing like that.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It was definitely not average.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized that
I was rich financially, what

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought at the time, but
very broke emotionally,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and that began my
journey, my search

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.057 align:middle line:90%
to look for something more.

00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:46.979 align:middle line:90%

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Like many other human beings,
what prompts the question is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
often pain.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
The existential crisis
of why am I here?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Why is this situation
the way it is?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Growing up in a tumultuous,
difficult situation

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
caused me to wonder what
I could do about it.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Why am I feeling
stuck at my job?

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Why am I feeling like
a rat in a wheel cage

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
doing the same thing,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:90%
getting the same results?

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
How do I get out of that set of
conditions and preconceptions

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
so that I can get a
different set of results?

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It starts by asking
that question.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that
some of us grew up

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
in environments that are
very different, but all of us

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
take responsibility.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And even if you've had a, quote
unquote, "rough life," a lot

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
of challenges, a lot
of blocks on your path,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:90%
you can meet that challenge.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There's billboards
everywhere,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:90%
have you been in a car accident?

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.903 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault.
Call us today and we'll

00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
sue the pants off of them.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, no one wants to take
responsibility for anything

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that they do, for their
behavior, for their driving,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
masses, the average person

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
makes tons of excuses
in their life,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
but the primary person
that they make excuses to

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
is not to others,
it's to themselves.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have a
reason why I'm this way.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Sure, you do.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
However, where are
you at right now?

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to make a
change at this point,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:90%
or do you just need a hug?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people will accept
part of it and say, yes,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
but, and then as soon as they
say the but, it denies what you

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
just said yes to and presents
what you really believe

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
your excuse, the reason
it's so hard for you.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:90%
That's your excuse.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, that excuse is not valid.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:10%
You may think it's valid, but
there's plenty of other people

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:10%
that have had equally as bad
an upbringing as you've had,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:10%
in fact, a lot worse.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:10%
So I could sit down with any
one of you, look at your excuse,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:10%
and find a way to
present an option.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Our perception of the
world is massively distorted,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:84%
because our perception is only
based on our own experiences,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
our own personal
views, our own beliefs,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's based on what we were
taught and what we learned.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we perceive to
be true, whether it is true

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's complete
BS, when we get out there,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
we will project that
out onto the world.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Feelings of
lack of worthiness,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
don't be proud of what you look
like, don't be so confident,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that programming comes in in
childhood and continues all

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
the way through adulthood.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And unless you go and
you rewrite this story,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
you can have a repeat of
the same type of story

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%
as you get older.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It'll just be a
more complicated,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated version of
it, but ultimately, it'll

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:90%
be a sad story.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Those beliefs that we
got in the first place were

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
our subconscious accepting
the fact that it isn't easy.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Life is a struggle.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Money is hard to make.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
All these beliefs we've
heard from other people

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
we accept as being
the way the world is.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
The simple truth is
that our beliefs are not

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:90%
true in themselves.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
They become true in our
experience if we believe them.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we have those types
of beliefs that really wire up

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
the brain, we must
first identify,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
how can I go back and basically
disconnect from that old view?

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.162 align:middle line:84%
>> All of us have
resistance somewhere.

00:06:41.162 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
If you look deep enough,
you'll find that place

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to go, the
place you don't want to look.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's too uncomfortable,
it's too scary.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.927 align:middle line:84%
And I would argue that that's
where the hot stuff is.

00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go
deeper and find out

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:90%
about a person's identity.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
What is it that they
believe about themselves

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that is causing them
to behave that way?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting poor results,
less than desired results

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
from your unconscious
mind, it means that there's

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:90%
some bad programming in there.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:84%
It means that there's some
outdated software that needs

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:90%
to be updated and upgraded.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what NLP and
hypnosis is all about.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's doing work to
rewrite the software,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
rewrite the story so
that you can ultimately

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:90%
get a different story.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The important thing isn't
our physical environment at all.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
The important
thing is our minds.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I know from experience
we can set it in motion.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people don't always
understand about how the world

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
works and how energy works
and things like that,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.735 align:middle line:84%
but there are these energy
waves everywhere around us.

00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Couple hundred years
ago, somebody just

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:84%
figured out how to latch on
to them like radio waves.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:90%
The energy was always there.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can now talk from
anywhere in the world

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:90%
to any other part of the world.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I think people don't
give themselves enough credit,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize that we are the
most powerful, human, walking,

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
talking transmission towers
on the entire planet.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And just like your cell
phone, that little box

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
is constantly sending
and receiving signals.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But so are people,
so much so that we

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
could walk into a room full of
strangers, not know anybody,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
see somebody way over the
other side of the room,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
we don't know the person,
but something about them

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:90%
draws us to them.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:90%
We all give off this vibe.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We hear that all the
time, oh, their vibe.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:84%
They have a nice vibe, a good
vibe, they have a weird vibe.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And vibe is short for
vibration, and vibration

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:90%
is the equivalent as frequency.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can have a high
frequency or a low frequency.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So many of us don't say,
I'm in a high vibration

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:90%
or low vibration.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.086 align:middle line:84%
We just say I feel
good or I feel bad.

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
It's not just positive
thinking, because I'm

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:90%
not a positive thinker at all.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of these people that
just says be happy all the time

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and think positive and all that.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really one
of those people.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But I also do
understand the power

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:84%
of holding a view
or a belief so much

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
so for something you
want until fruition,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:90%
until the thing is created.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And the key there
is dare to dream,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and keep the end in mind.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
If we envision and imagine
a greater, better life

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, and we keep
focusing on that vision,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
doubts and fears arise, and
it seems the vision crumbles,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:90%
but then we get back to it.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:10%
I heard a wonderful
thing a while ago,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:10%
that a plane is off course
over 95% of the time,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:10%
but the pilot keeps
correcting over and over

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:10%
and over, and it
reaches its destination.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
When I first heard
of that, I thought,

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:90%
that's the story of my life.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Just doesn't work to pray for
something once, to ask once.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
The frustration and anxiety and
excuses cancel out that wish.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got to come back to the
wish, to the dream, to asking.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Every day, keep asking.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Show me the next step to take.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I do think 99% of the effective
work I've done to transform

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.953 align:middle line:90%
my life has been internal.

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
As Eckhart as in "The
Power of Now," get

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
the inside right and the
outside will fall into place.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I am sensible and in
control of my finances.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm creating total
financial success

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
in an easy and relaxed manner,
a healthy and positive mood,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
in its own perfect time for
the highest good of all.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When you get back
to the realization,

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of the one
thing that you have control

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
over is your ability to align
yourself with the thing that

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
you actually want energetically,
it just depends how long does

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.300 align:middle line:84%
it take for you to align
yourself with that thing.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.405 align:middle line:84%
Because at first, there's
this like, confusion or doubt,

00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you get to this
point it's like, OK,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
I think it's possible.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I think
it is possible.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:90%
You get to like, hope.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the positive
thinking part of you.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.095 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I hope
this works out.

00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:54.748 align:middle line:84%
And then you get this
other place like,

00:10:54.748 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I really believe this
is going to work out.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you finally
get to this place of

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
like, I don't care what or how,
but this is going to happen.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:90%
This thing is done.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It's complete.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:90%
It's complete in my mind.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It's complete in my body.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It's complete in my soul.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I am there before I
actually get the thing.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
hold that alignment

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and give the world
and people and things,

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
circumstances, an opportunity
to work out for you.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all about creating
something out of apparently

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:84%
To me, I look at it as a
completely magical process,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to use
those words at all.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You can just say strategic
planning has its results,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:90%
whatever words you want to use.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But for me, what
it does get down to

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:84%
is the basic, deep mystery
of all of creation.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
We can channel that force, if
you will, or we can ask for it.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:90%
We can bring it into our minds.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.652 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a famous occultist
from the Victorian era

00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:10%
in England, and his name was
Aleister Crowley, and he said,

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:10%
magic is the art and science
of causing change to happen

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:10%
in accordance with one's will.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
By visualizing that
future moment, putting

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:84%
in a set of
instructions, and then

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
when I let go, turn my
attention away from it,

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
my unconscious mind will be
drawn towards experiencing it,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:90%
effortlessly, easily.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It will seem like the
right thing to do.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It will seem as though
I'm compelled to do that.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It'll be automatically
arising from the way

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I've made sense of that
reality moving forward.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
different ways to do this.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Is it really magic?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Depends on how you
define magic, doesn't it?

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Dean Radin.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm the chief scientist at the
Institute of Noetic Sciences.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we do at this institute

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
is study experiences that
people report very commonly that

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
challenge the prevailing
scientific idea about who

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and what we are.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And so these experiences
range from simple intuition,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
like gut feelings,
to psychic phenomena,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:90%
to mystical experience.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We're interested,
then, in when somebody

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:84%
has a transformative
experience of this type,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's a pretty
large range of them.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And we also gain some
sense that the experiences

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
that they have are real and
not just an illusion, then

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:84%
how do we begin to
understand them?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of what we do in
the scientific sense

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:90%
is in the laboratory.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
We use methods like high-density
EEG to look at brain activity.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:84%
We use psychophysiological
methods

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
to look at how the brain and
body are related to each other.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:84%
We use methods in physics,
methods in computer science

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:90%
and statistics.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So the magic I'm talking
about, first of all,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is not Harry Potter, and
it's not Harry Houdini.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Those are both fictional magic.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the real stuff.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So real magic consists
of three categories.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:84%
The first category we
can call divination.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that
your mind can perceive

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%
through space and time.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
From a materialistic
point of view,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how that
can happen very easily.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
From an idealistic point
of view, it has to happen.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
It is the way things are.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The second category
I call force of will,

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.350 align:middle line:84%
which from a
scientific perspective,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we might use terms like
mind-matter interaction

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.982 align:middle line:90%
or psychokinetic effects.

00:14:23.982 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the notion that
your intention, your will,

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
can manifest.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It makes things happen.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:90%
The third category is theurgy.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
In practice, it's about evoking
spirits in ceremonial magic

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
where you try to get spirits
to do things on your behalf.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I got
interested in magic

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is because for
most of my career,

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying
parapsychological phenomena,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
telepathy and
clairvoyance and so on,

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and after studying the
esoteric literature even just

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit, I realized
that what we had been studying

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory is
exactly what people have

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:90%
called traditional magic.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Divination is clairvoyance
and precognition.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Force of will is
psychokinetic effects.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Theurgy are phenomena like
near-death experiences

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:90%
and medium shift.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:10%
So because I was surprised at
having spent almost 40 years

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:10%
studying these phenomena
and not realizing

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:10%
that is what traditional
magic is about,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:10%
I decided to write this
book to express essentially

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:10%
what I discovered,
which to other people

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:10%
might seem, well, of course
it that is the way it is.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.470 align:middle line:90%
How did you not even know that?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is because I went
through the academic tradition,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
where we assume a certain
view of the world.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And in that view of the world,
ideas of traditional magic

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:90%
are laughable.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be the case.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> My background and interest in
spirituality and science really

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:90%
is a lifelong passion.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I started
as a young child

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
being very aware of
the fact that there

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
is this deeper level
of consciousness

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
connecting all of us.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find
out more about that

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and get into the science of it.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So I chose to go to
UC Berkeley, where

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I got my degree in physics.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And my main focus of
interest in the program

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
had to do with quantum physics,
which I found tremendously

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:90%
intuitive for me.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
There has been a lot
of emphasis on the idea

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that magical thinking
doesn't work.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it turns
out, magical thinking

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:90%
is pretty powerful.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Because in the quantum realm,
the realm of imagination

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:90%
is the king.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the foundation
for everything.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.445 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is primary.

00:16:35.445 --> 00:16:37.963 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people who are
attracted to magic in the first

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:84%
place, they don't
care how it works.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
They don't even care about the
debate over whether it exists.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%
They just want to use it.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So the two simple
forms that have

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
been used as far back as
we can see in history,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
one is called writing
magic, and the other

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:90%
is called sigil magic.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So these are very
elementary practices.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
But both of them have persisted
throughout history, probably

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:90%
because they do something.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So from a psychological
perspective,

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
you can say, well, the act of
writing down what you want,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that will just
psychologically predispose you

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:90%
to seeing that happening.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, whether it
actually does cause the world

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:90%
to be different.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of what we
study in the laboratory,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:84%
not so far these
magical practices,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
but things like that where
you make very strong intention

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you see whether it
changes something in the world.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Sigil magic is like
writing magic except that,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:84%
instead of writing something
down, you make a symbol for it

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to stand for the
thing that you want.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that
shape, the symbol

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
itself will remind
you of the intention.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You use whatever method
is necessary in order

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to put all of your
intention into that symbol,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
like push through the
symbol to make it happen.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, as is seen in
the laboratory a lot,

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
there's something called the
release of effort effect.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
That while you're pushing like
crazy with your intention,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:90%
nothing's going to happen.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:90%
It happens when you release.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:90%
So with the sigil magic as well.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You push really hard
through this symbol.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And then you might burn it.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
You might put it
away in a drawer.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of it
somehow so that you

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
allow the intention to go do
whatever it's going to do.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people think
this is something weird.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like
people to realize

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
is that basically, every time
we make a choice in our mind,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
we're actually making
a quantum jump.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Quantum jumping is
such a big field

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot
that falls within it.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything from--
the placebo effect

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, an
excellent example of it,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to finding lost things, to
suddenly having skill sets

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and abilities where you didn't
have those capabilities before.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
These are all things
that are possible.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%
There's really no end in sight.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much anything
that you would wish for

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is attainable,
because we're looking

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
at the nature of reality
itself and the way that you're

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:90%
interacting with it.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:90%
So the steps involved.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So do you get a
quantum jump from being

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
in one state of being, maybe
being sick to being well,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The way that you
can make that jump

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:84%
is to start by getting into
that relaxed, energized state

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So things that are
conducive to that

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.117 align:middle line:84%
would be meditation,
lucid dreaming.

00:19:26.117 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
You can think of that as being
in a theta state of mind.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like a daydream
state of mind.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And just make that a
regular part of your life.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So that you feel
like, OK, this is

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
how it feels to just
not have any worries.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:90%
You feel energized and relaxed.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The more you do it,
also, it gets easier.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Then the next step
is to really feel

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that you're making a selection
of where you'd like to go.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't know
where we want to go.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I like to then ask,
how good can it get?

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.712 align:middle line:90%
And let that unfold naturally.

00:19:57.712 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to your
subconscious when you do that.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
knows what's good.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%
You will go to the right place.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a natural
way to guide yourself.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a clear
view, I want to get healthy,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
then you can have
that picture in mind.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
To the degree your subconscious
believes that's possible,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
that dictates the degree of
success you're about to have.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend,
keep an open mind,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
read lots of
stories and accounts

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:84%
of miracles, these magical
happenings, these reality

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:90%
shifts.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Third part is just, act as if
it already happened and you

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:90%
behave accordingly.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds crazy,
but people experience

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
what they're able to experience
based on the energy they bring,

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
what their subconscious
really needs.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Because your subconscious is
in the driver's seat here.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And what you really
believe and what you need

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
is what you're going
to end up getting,

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
pretty much all the time.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:84%
When you need it to
happen, it will happen.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're open minded,
you've brought that energy,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.295 align:middle line:84%
this is basically the
science of miracles.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the popular sense,
this notion is sometimes thought

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
of as, you create
your own reality,

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:90%
that your ideas will manifest.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
idea of affirmations

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
comes from and to some
extent, positive psychology.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You can trace that
line of thought

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.360 align:middle line:90%
all the way back to shamanism.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.075 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the
esoteric tradition.

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So then somebody
could say, well,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
then how come if I want to
have world peace tomorrow,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about it,
it's not happening.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
So what am I doing wrong?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Or I want to have a
big, big pile of gold.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it, so that
model must be wrong.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
My interpretation of that is
that the conscious level mind

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
where this is happening, this
is not where the action happens.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
All of the action happens at
a much deeper level of mind.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like
looking at an iceberg.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
The tip of the iceberg,
you can see it.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
That's their
conscious awareness.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But most of it by far
is below the surface.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the action happens.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not just a matter
of telling yourself once a day,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I can do this, and lots of
people like me succeed at this.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need to address
the issues of your heart

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and of your subconscious
and your gut, all of that.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to do that is
to start listening to yourself.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't do that.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
They think, I'm just going
to tell myself what to do,

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's all going to work.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the reasons why
I wish for a golden Mercedes

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't show up
is because we have lots

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
of unconscious things that
are working against us.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
We know that we have
self-defeating behaviors,

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we wouldn't see
levels of obesity that we have

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and people wouldn't drink
and smoke as much as they do.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So you may consciously
say, I'm not

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
going to eat this cookie
because it's not good for me.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.422 align:middle line:84%
But you will find your hand
going to get the cookie

00:22:46.422 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and then it will
pick up the cookie

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.208 align:middle line:84%
and it will bring it to your
mouth and you will eat it.

00:22:50.208 --> 00:22:51.625 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your
unconscious that

00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
can override your
conscious awareness.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the reasons
why meditation as a practice

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:84%
is useful, not only for
mental and physical health,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
but is essential when
it comes to things

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:90%
like magical practice.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:10%
In the magical traditions,
what a yogi might call samadhi,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:10%
which is the very deep
levels of mystical unity,

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.775 align:middle line:10%
a magician will call gnosis.

00:23:13.775 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
magical traditions

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
say that for magic to
work, you have to do it

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.791 align:middle line:90%
from the level of gnosis.

00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, most people
don't go there.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to get there
because the world is constantly

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.190 align:middle line:90%
pulling our attention away.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:90%
But that's what's necessary.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems simple
to do a quantum jump.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't mean it's easy.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I do martial arts and
they say the same thing there.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Some of these things are simple.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
They're not necessarily easy.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And with quantum jumping,
there's so much involved,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
starting with this whole
notion of attaining

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:90%
a relaxed, energized state.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And often, when people are
suffering, when there's true

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
misery, when they're actually
engaged with survival

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
issues and real
difficult challenges,

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
then it might be very difficult
to get to that place of feeling

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:90%
relaxed and energized.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step of
envisioning something positive

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
can be equally challenging
if your entire history

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
has been based on nothing
good really happening.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what
love is, for example,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to picture
what that feels like.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know unconditional
support and compassion,

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to imagine it.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
There can be all kinds of
challenges along the way.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It's still doable,
but that needs

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.933 align:middle line:84%
to be a discipline of
working in that direction.

00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people who do
affirmations will just try

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to harangue their
consciousness to death.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
If you waste time saying, I'm a
millionaire, I'm a millionaire,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.253 align:middle line:84%
I'm a millionaire, I'm a
millionaire, I'm a millionaire,

00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
but then you're not
sending your resumes out,

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
you're not coming up
with a product or service

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
or talking to entrepreneurs
and figuring out

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
what you can do to
be a millionaire,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.787 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing
wasting time trying

00:24:59.787 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to convince yourself of
something you don't really

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:90%
believe?

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to work.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I just want it to come to me.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we probably all want that.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
We all want just a million
dollars to come to us.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Thinking doesn't make things so.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You still have to take
action in the world

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and you've got to get results.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.718 align:middle line:84%
You got to prove that
it's true for you.

00:25:18.718 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't work with
my clients and just

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
do a bunch of magical
actions with them

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.152 align:middle line:84%
and expect that their whole
world changes in that moment.

00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We are going to shift some
things at a feeling level.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.235 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go in.

00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to change how you
feel about it so that you take

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
action, so that you start to
acquire the things that you

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:90%
do want.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:10%
You feel motivated to do it
and you take action on it.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:10%
I want to do that action now.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Expand your comfort zone.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Start with what you have.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The older I get,
the clearer I see it.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's just
two essential things.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.963 align:middle line:84%
The first is, dare to
imagine doing what you love.

00:25:54.963 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
essential thing

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
is just, deal with the doubts
and fears that will inevitably

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:90%
arise when you dare to dream.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The more expansive
the dream, the bigger

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:90%
the doubts and fears.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:90%
You can deal with those.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The only real
failure is quitting.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Just don't quit.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Within every adversity is
an equal or greater benefit.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:90%
You turn your thinking around.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
When you've got a major
problem happening,

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
shift your thinking by
just asking yourself,

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:90%
what opportunities are in this?

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a part of us that
needs to allow for that magic

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have to know that
there is this force,

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:90%
there is this thing, you know?

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's God, whether
it's the universe, whatever

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
you believe, in some
way, at some level,

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
your life is trying to
communicate with you.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
You can be walking through
the living room at your house.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The kids or your
partner, somebody

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
watching a movie or a
commercial, something

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:84%
just in passing, and there's
a slight little phrase,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:84%
a little thing that the person
on the other side of the movie

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
You didn't pay attention
to anything else.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But in those three
seconds, five seconds,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:90%
you heard something they said.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those
things is intuition.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
It's planting a seed in
the garden of the mind.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's our job to be
able to quiet the noise

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
because intuition
comes like a whisper.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's so quiet and
so light and so soft.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Many people miss it
because of all of the noise

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that they've created
in their life.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So the main thing I recommend
is people start by meditating.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
If you go on a walk
and you're in nature,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that's a perfect time to just
pay attention to your breathing

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:90%
as you're walking.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.652 align:middle line:84%
It's all about getting back
to an observer state of being,

00:27:44.652 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:84%
where you notice that you're
not the problems in your life.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.240 align:middle line:84%
You're not the
role that you play.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:84%
You're not the thoughts
that you think.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.560 align:middle line:90%
You're the observer of that.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're the one who is making
the choice in all these things.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot more choice
than you thought you did.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I pick up expectations and
fears and doubts and misgivings

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:90%
about things that have happened.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And if I let that clog up
my entire cognitive system,

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
then pretty soon,
all of my decisions

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
are being based on
my fears, my doubts.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So meditation helps me
clear out those beliefs that

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:90%
get in the way.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
clogging things up.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Just like you need
to vacuum your house

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:90%
and clean your refrigerator.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:90%
You need to clean your mind.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What is meditation?

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Can we simplify it?

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Can the normal person,
the average person

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:84%
do it without
leaving their home,

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:90%
without leaving their job?

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:90%
What does it take to meditate?

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it?

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
the mind settles down

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and the body settles down and
our sense of self disappears?

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I teach a lot of
essentials for meditation.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But the three ingredients we
all have, gentle attention,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
a willingness to
sit down and do it,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and then something
to pay attention to.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And you come back
again and again

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and again and again to the
focus of your meditation,

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your breath
or mantra, whether it's

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:90%
a candle flame or an emotion.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how many
times you go off topic,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.220 align:middle line:84%
you come back
again, again, again.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
say, I can't meditate.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And I say, why?

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I don't
have enough time.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, how much
time do you stand

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:90%
in line for a cup of coffee?

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
How much time do you spend
on social media on the web?

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I say, take
10 minutes of that

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and turn it back to yourself.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And asking that
question, who am I?

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Who am I really?

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Who is it that's
living through me,

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that's looking through my eyes?

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness is so
obvious that for many people,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
they don't even know what
you're talking about.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Most academics, and this is now
true everywhere in the world,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:84%
are taught according to
principles that have developed

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:90%
within Western science.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
That scientific
worldview is based

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:84%
on a philosophical
set of assumptions

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:90%
known as materialism.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So materialism, in
a nutshell, means

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that everything is made
out of matter and energy,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:84%
including mind,
including consciousness,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
including everything we
know about subjectivity.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the prevailing view.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
challenging that view,

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
you have the same problem
that you would in any domain

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
where you start
challenging the status quo.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:84%
The status quo doesn't
like to be challenged.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So it will push hard against
anything that challenges it

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:90%
in an attempt to squash it.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the problem
with materialism.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Materialism doesn't know what
to do with consciousness.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.072 align:middle line:90%
So it sort of sets it aside.

00:30:50.072 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll worry about that later.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Or it comes up with the
idea that somehow the brain

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is complex enough that it
gives rise to experience, even

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
though nobody has any idea
how that could possibly be.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
materialism is pretty good,

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
us the technology

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.508 align:middle line:84%
to do this sort of an interview
with a special machine that

00:31:07.508 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:90%
captures my image and so on.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to
throw materialism away.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.883 align:middle line:90%
It's too good.

00:31:11.883 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
is it good enough

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:90%
to account for everything?

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And here's where we
have the problem.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Clearly it is not accounting
for all of the experiences

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:90%
that people talk about.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:10%
So what's missing?

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
esoteric traditions,

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.990 align:middle line:84%
you immediately bump
up against what might

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.670 align:middle line:90%
be thought of as proto science.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So alchemy, astrology,
and herbalism.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy was the
forerunner of chemistry.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Astrology is a forerunner of
astronomy, to some extent.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And herbalism is the
forerunner of pharmaceuticals.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is that historically,

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%
all three of those
proto sciences

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:84%
also had a fourth element in it,
the element of consciousness,

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:84%
where the practitioner
of alchemy

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
or the practitioner of
astrology or herbalism

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
knew that their intention was
a very important component

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:90%
of what they were doing.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:90%
This is true in each case.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:10%
And yet, science has
stripped that out.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't consider
when you take a pill

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that your intention is
important, except maybe

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.945 align:middle line:90%
as a placebo.

00:32:10.945 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But certainly when you're
preparing something

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
like metals or in chemistry,
people don't think about that.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But that was part of
the original idea.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what
is happening now

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
is that science is
slowly beginning

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.870 align:middle line:84%
to mature to the point where
it sees that the intention

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
of the scientist

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is as important an ingredient as
it was in alchemy and astrology

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:10%
So I looked in detail at
the esoteric traditions,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:10%
all the way back
from shamanism to

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras, Eastern
traditions, all the way up

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:10%
to the present time.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And you find that there's a
similar thread of thought.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they're saying
that a better model of reality

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is idealism, that everything
is made out of mind,

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.140 align:middle line:90%
including matter.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
That solves, at one stroke--

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.220 align:middle line:84%
if that method is correct, if
that assumption is correct,

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.160 align:middle line:84%
it solves all of the puzzles
about psychic phenomena

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and mysticism and
all of that stuff.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So now consciousness
came here first.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the scientific
challenge is,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
how do we get from
pure awareness

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to emerge into space and
time and matter and energy?

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are lots of people
working on that very problem.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:84%
How do you emerge out
of something that seems

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:90%
non-physical into physicality?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When we recognize that every
single material thing at its

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.530 align:middle line:84%
core is energy and
everything is vibrating,

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:84%
then you can get a feeling for
this nature of existence that

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:84%
is not as materially
real as we tend to think.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's what
it's really about,

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that the nature
of reality itself

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness
looking at itself.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.110 align:middle line:90%
It's basically a feedback loop.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at the outside
world realizing, wait a minute.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what we're seeing
is consciousness itself.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to seem,
that is the case.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're at a time
in our history

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
where quantum physics
is challenging all of us

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to take a whole new look at
the way we see the world.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Some scientists who strongly
resist this are of the opinion

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:26.652 align:middle line:84%
that we basically understand
how reality works.

00:34:26.652 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of things
left over to mop up,

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.230 align:middle line:90%
but we kind of got it.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I think that view
is so arrogant.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And even just from a
historical perspective,

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
you see about every 20 years
some prominent scientist

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.978 align:middle line:84%
saying, well, it's
all wrapped up.

00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:42.020 align:middle line:84%
We just have these one or
two things left to fix,

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and then we got it all.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
It's just stupid
from my perspective.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Science is young.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
And we have far
more things that we

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
fundamentally at all

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:84%
than we do understand
a little bit.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
fears that arises then.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Saying, well, I've spent my
entire career as a professor,

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:84%
professing certain ideas
about the way things work.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're coming to me
and saying, actually,

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:84%
you didn't understand
that at all.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.455 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's frightening.

00:35:09.455 --> 00:35:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no one wants
to think that they

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons
why the Institute of Noetic

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Sciences is a private,
non-profit institution.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we're looking
at things that do

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:90%
challenge the status quo.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this in
the academic world.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We were among the first to
support research on meditation,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle line:84%
research on the positive
psychological and health

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:84%
consequences of things
like gratefulness

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness, mind-body
connections in health

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.692 align:middle line:84%
We were supporting
these kinds of ideas

00:35:42.692 --> 00:35:44.150 align:middle line:84%
at a time when they
were considered

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.470 align:middle line:90%
laughable and extremely risky.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody wants to
live a comfortable life,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
the easiest thing to do is to
go along with the flow, always.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And if someone has
a family and they

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:84%
have children to
support and all that,

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.510 align:middle line:84%
it is actually the
responsible thing

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of the
rest of the family,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:90%
to not challenge the status quo.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society
that is constantly

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.030 align:middle line:90%
pushing certain ways to be.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And among other
things, we are not

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:84%
taught to think for ourselves
or to think critically

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
or to question our own motives
and our unconscious desires.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:90%
It requires taking risk.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:90%
But so what?

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Life is a risk.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a challenge to face
up to a lot of opposition.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, there
is a driving force

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that tends to move events
in a certain direction.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
gone up against it,

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.073 align:middle line:84%
it can feel like a
fish swimming upstream.

00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Like you're going in one
direction and everyone else

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:90%
is going somewhere else.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The more you go into this
practice of meditation

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and the more you recognize
that you are a consciousness,

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I would not say it
becomes easy, but it

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:84%
becomes possible to
stand up to society,

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to your parents, or
your internalization

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.853 align:middle line:84%
of what you think your
parents want for you.

00:37:04.853 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing about
doing this quantum jumping

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is, often you'll notice that
people seem like they change.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And where there had
been opposition,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:90%
now there's support.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I know a lot of people have
a struggle with their parents

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.050 align:middle line:84%
because their parents aren't
supporting them in doing what

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:90%
they love.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Their parents have
a different idea.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:90%
My father certainly did.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:90%
He was concerned for me.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Going into theater and music
did not seem like a good idea.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to
go into business.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, I
got deep somehow,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't do any good
to do what your parents want.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:90%
You have to do what you want.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't do any
good to fight them either.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.020 align:middle line:90%
So I just ignored my father.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:90%
He complained to my brother.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, Mark is so
slippery, you know?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.680 align:middle line:90%
He just blows me off.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.760 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't fight me.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.770 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't object.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.880 align:middle line:90%
He just sort of slides away.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the requisites of
change is that you have to deal

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:84%
with objections at home or in
whatever environment you go

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:90%
back to.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you want to do a
lot of work on your identity.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, you're
awakening your ability

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.210 align:middle line:10%
to cause changes in
accordance with your will.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to tap into
feelings of worthiness,

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:90%
starting to feel strong.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.460 align:middle line:90%
But then you go home.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And these people
have a picture of you

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that is not the picture that
you're working to become.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the old you.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:10%
And it may not even be accurate,
but it's their image of you.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
can say, hey, look.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm really working on this.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.855 align:middle line:84%
This is really, really
important to me.

00:38:39.855 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
This is who I'm
working to become.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd really love to
count on your support.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I know you're just kidding,
but I'd appreciate it

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.330 align:middle line:90%
if you just cut it out for now.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
respect that, I'm

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.670 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
ask you to leave.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.337 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to not
hang out with you.

00:38:54.337 --> 00:38:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't want someone else
to sabotage right now.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:90%
It might mean not responding.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.350 align:middle line:84%
It might mean hardening
yourself psychologically to be

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:90%
able to handle it.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't always ask
other people to change.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, they won't.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Not everybody
really wants help.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:15.290 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've learned
the hard way in this field

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is, some people just
want to complain.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to
complain about the problem

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and don't actually want
to resolve the problem.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've all had friends
or heard of somebody

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that, they always seem
to find themselves

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.682 align:middle line:84%
in the same type of scenario,
the same type of issue,

00:39:31.682 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:84%
the same relationship, even
though with three or four

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.752 align:middle line:84%
different people,
it's the same story.

00:39:35.752 --> 00:39:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, look, you're always
attracting people like this.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Something is going on
with you internally

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
resolve in order to move

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:90%
on to the next level of life.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody
really wants to change.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible, but you also
must believe, have the faith

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:90%
that it's possible.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And then just align yourself
with the people out there

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.153 align:middle line:84%
that are also on the same
wavelength, so to speak.

00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And stay away from
the people that

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.460 align:middle line:90%
are going to drag you down.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And we really need
to dictate and decide

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
up front how much time
we are willing to put

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:84%
into those friendships or those
partnerships or those people.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And you have to think
about that in advance.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You can't just let it work out
however it's going to work out.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it will suck
up all of your energy

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have to keep your energy
intact and focus for the things

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that are really most
important to you.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the best things
you can do is just set a good

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to help people
unless they ask for help.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So I don't recommend pushing
your values on someone else

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.030 align:middle line:84%
unless they ask you,
like, what are you doing?

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise probably that's
not their path right now.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
You need to be your own
example of being the change

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that you wish to
see in the world.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything happens
exactly as it should.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a
very unique place

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be grateful
for where we are today,

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.688 align:middle line:84%
grateful for what
you have, grateful

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:84%
for what we've
accomplished, grateful

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:90%
for all your experiences.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same
time, be able to want

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
or expect or allow more
to continue to come in.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Life can be very complicated
and difficult when people are

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:90%
grasping all the time.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
we're constantly

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
achieving something new instead
of celebrating what is, we

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:90%
become less and less satisfied.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like a drug.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Money is a drug.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Sex is a drug.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Shopping is a drug.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.694 align:middle line:84%
It's a bottomless pit,
trying to satisfy ourselves.

00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> This culture, especially
in the United States,

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:84%
this society really has
this succeed, excel.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the consumer mentality.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Do more, buy more,
be more, have more.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.700 align:middle line:84%
A bigger house,
bigger car, fill up

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.580 align:middle line:84%
a garage full of 10,000
rolls of toilet paper,

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and buy as much as you can.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And people have garages and
storages and more stuff.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And they have so
much stuff, they

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:90%
can't even store the stuff.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.995 align:middle line:84%
They have to pay for a place to
store the stuff that they can't

00:41:59.995 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:90%
even store at their own house.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is the way people live.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
have more externally,

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.810 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't always correlate
to being internally fulfilled.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Those are two completely
different things.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And external, your environment,
the house, the cars, the stuff

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.560 align:middle line:90%
is never fulfilling.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Its short term.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:90%
You get the fulfillment.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:90%
You buy it.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.360 align:middle line:90%
You have it.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.500 align:middle line:90%
You play with it.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And you get the short term,
instant gratification type

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.630 align:middle line:84%
But just like a
child with a new toy,

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:84%
you run out of motivation
after a little while.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:90%
And you're on to the next toy.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The ultimate insanity
of it was the '80s.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember a guy, he actually
had a bumper sticker saying,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:84%
whoever dies with
the most toys wins.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And I remember thinking, wrong.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.290 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not about amassing
more and more toys.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.670 align:middle line:84%
True, when you're
poor, there's a lot

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
of stress about
paying the bills.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But going purely
for material success

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:84%
will never achieve
the satisfaction

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
looking for in life.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be careful
to keep your life simple,

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
because the kingdom
of heaven is within.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I think more and more,
conscious business owners have

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to start thinking in terms of,
there's enough for everyone.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
there are solutions.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.800 align:middle line:84%
There are ways to
be more inclusive.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You can find that, hey, if I'm
doing hypnosis and hypnotherapy

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of wonderful
stuff and there's

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
someone else who
does it near me,

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:84%
well, why do I have to
see them as a competitor?

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Why not introduce myself?

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Why not connect and think about,
how can we benefit each other?

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.110 align:middle line:84%
There is enough of
the resources, money,

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%
people around that if you
have a good product, if you

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.200 align:middle line:84%
have a good service,
there's enough for everyone.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> John Templeton
put it so simply.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, the way to get wealthy
is to make others wealthy.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of think
on this planet,

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.900 align:middle line:90%
there has been progress made.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And we do take two steps forward
and then sometimes a huge step

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:84%
back as the old systems
are thrashing out

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.940 align:middle line:90%
fighting for survival.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the long run, I
would think the world view

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:21.430 align:middle line:84%
based on love and partnership,
working it out with everybody,

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:25.580 align:middle line:84%
realizing we are
one global family.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We're in some ways,
experiencing a dark time.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.850 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, we're
experiencing a renaissance.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And so there are some threats
to our existence right now.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
more and more people

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.703 align:middle line:84%
who are paying attention,
and more and more people

00:44:37.703 --> 00:44:40.780 align:middle line:84%
who are looking for
solutions in areas

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't look before.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Get out there and do
something nice for somebody.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And don't expect
anything in return.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Be kind.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:90%
People need it.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:84%
If we remember that the
people who we complain about

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.030 align:middle line:84%
are human, that underneath
their beliefs and ideologies,

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.180 align:middle line:84%
they're human beings,
it opens up our ability

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:90%
to hear one another.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we buy into
the materialistic world.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And we think that
we have no power.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.980 align:middle line:90%
We think that we're victims.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there's a great
deal more power in each of us

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and all of us together
collectively than most of us

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:90%
ever realize.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's up to all of us
to encourage ourselves

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and one another to maintain
that sense of who we really are.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe very
strongly that this

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is the time in our
world history where

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:84%
it's more important than
ever before that people

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.095 align:middle line:90%
recognize this.

00:45:44.095 --> 00:45:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for those people who
don't settle down their nervous

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:84%
system with meditation,
who don't have a spiritual

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.530 align:middle line:84%
or creative practice, their
mind is constantly traveling

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.020 align:middle line:84%
into the past, into the
future, and into other

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.430 align:middle line:90%
people's business.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, they're not

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:84%
present for themselves
and the world that's

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.740 align:middle line:90%
being revealed to them.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.820 align:middle line:84%
A zen master might say,
show me the future.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Show me your past.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And there's no way to do it.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Those questions,
they stop the mind.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will
gyrate a little bit,

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually,
it settles down.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We dive into the
source of everything.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We started naming some
of the qualities of it.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.130 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It's ever present.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It's intelligent.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the
transcendence, is when

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.300 align:middle line:84%
we lose track of time and
space and we transcend

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.210 align:middle line:90%
the element of materialism.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But we can't just go
there because we want to.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Will doesn't have
much to do with it.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You cannot will your
mind to stop thinking.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:84%
You cannot will desires
to be made manifest.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:90%
You cannot will enlightenment.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.580 align:middle line:90%
You can't will it.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It just happens on its
own accord, spontaneously.

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to be present
and here it comes.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:84%
That's how I navigate life
from, with faith, patience,

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.630 align:middle line:90%
and grace.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.378 align:middle line:84%
>> But we sometimes
get a feeling, like,

00:47:15.378 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
there's something
else going on here,

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
much more connected.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:24.270 align:middle line:84%
That in a very real sense,
we're sharing the same dream.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I recognize that I'm,
in some ways, playing a role.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But who I really am
is so much bigger,

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:90%
so much more mysterious.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:32.710 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:33.640 align:middle line:90%
It's infinite.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.840 align:middle line:90%
It's timeless.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.990 align:middle line:90%
It's connected to everything.

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Then there's this
collaboration, a symphony

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:84%
of all these different,
harmonious pieces,

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.730 align:middle line:84%
each of us playing a
part of the overall song

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and that this is the so-called
music of the spheres,

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that it's our consciousness
that creates all of this.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we get there,
then that is oneness.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Because everything's
back together again,

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:84%
but in such a way that we don't
know what we're looking at.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And we never actually know.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We hope we're getting
closer to understanding it.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But I sometimes suspect
that as humans, we

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.270 align:middle line:84%
don't have the capacity
to actually understand

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.290 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And I see this
reflected a little bit

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.800 align:middle line:84%
when you have a mystic who
can go into mystical states.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They come back with a conviction
that, I understand it now.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.370 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.840 align:middle line:90%
And say, well, tell me.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.680 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And their response
is, it's ineffable.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I cannot describe it.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that
language at the everyday level

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is not capable of describing
what's actually going on.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Some mystics will say that they
come out of the mystical state.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they see the
world in a new way.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And everything is exactly
the way it's supposed to be.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think mystics,
philosophers, poets,

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
they express the reality
better than maybe you or I.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Because they allude to it.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
same with waking up

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to that which is looking
through your eyes.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You can call it
anything you want.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it Self with a
capital S. Some people call it

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.570 align:middle line:90%
spirit, god, soul.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:19.920 align:middle line:84%
The great spirit,
consciousness itself, it's

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.470 align:middle line:90%
that which animates all of this.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It's what's residing
at your deepest level.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient notion of Indra's
Net is that it's this necklace

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.910 align:middle line:84%
with lots of glittering
pieces of crystal in it.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.800 align:middle line:90%
And so each one is the universe.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But all the facets on it are
reflecting all of the others.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have this amazing
network of awareness,

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.700 align:middle line:84%
which is seeing itself reflected
again and again and again

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.750 align:middle line:90%
in an infinite number of ways.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of simmering at
some universal, unconscious

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.620 align:middle line:84%
level, trying to
wake up from a dream.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And when finally, whatever
we are understands it

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:84%
or it understands itself, it
wakes up and the dream is over.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I see it as, you go
along in your daily life.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:08.450 align:middle line:90%
You are a certain way.

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And then one day, you wake up.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment, everything
before that seems like a dream.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can wake
up multiple times.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So in my life, I
remember two instances

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:25.130 align:middle line:84%
where just walking to class in
college one day in the morning,

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:26.152 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:50:26.152 --> 00:50:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a very
strange experience.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.140 align:middle line:84%
A little bit like, you're
sleeping and now you wake up

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:90%
and you become aware.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a step
function, while walking

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.400 align:middle line:84%
to class one morning, that
everything before that,

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I felt as though I was sleeping.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.963 align:middle line:84%
And that this has
happened twice.

00:50:40.963 --> 00:50:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm imagining that there
are many things that can

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:90%
push that kind of experience.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The more awake you are and the
less dreaming you are, I think,

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the closer to
enlightenment you get.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, enlightenment is to
attain that sense of self that

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.020 align:middle line:90%
is pure consciousness.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize that
that's the real you.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.250 align:middle line:84%
That who you are is infinite,
is eternal, is connected.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's you
that's looking out

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.050 align:middle line:84%
through your eyes, who is
so much wiser, so much more

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.230 align:middle line:84%
connected, so much more
involved in everything.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's your true identity.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We are the creation
of the forces of life,

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.700 align:middle line:84%
an eternal blend of
ecstasy and strife,

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.220 align:middle line:84%
living as long as
the universe stays,

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:37.060 align:middle line:84%
which is forever through the
galaxy's nights and days.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:84%
From the big bang's beginning
to the black hole's destruction

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:44.560 align:middle line:84%
is but a day in the life
of our cosmic construction.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.270 align:middle line:84%
We'll live forever with the
stuff of stars, ever-changing,

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
ever-growing, born into
this life, born into death.

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Changing this form for
the one that comes next.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:84%
An eternal part of
an eternal creation,

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.290 align:middle line:84%
a quintessential piece
of divine revelation.

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I am this creation.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:12.360 align:middle line:90%
