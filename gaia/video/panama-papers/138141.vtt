In Washington DC, a secret
project investigating

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the wealth of the world's rich
and powerful is in full swing.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:17.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We are working with a team
of international reporters

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to unravel a vast
network of companies

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:23.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that hides the financial
affairs of corporations,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
politicians, oligarchs
and criminals.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- What we're looking at here
is really a parallel universe,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.782 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
where people can go
to play and avoid

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the rules in their
own countries.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.535 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They can go to
offshore tax havens

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and basically do things they

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.747 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
wouldn't be allowed
to do at home.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
With the International
Consortium

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.504 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of Investigative Journalists,

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
we got access to a
massive database

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of documents from tax
havens around the world:

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
a stunning leak of
financial secrets

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from a Panamanian law firm
called Mossack Fonseca.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We're looking at easily
the biggest leak

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in history in terms of the size.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We're looking at more than
11 million documents.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And if you were to compare
it with sort of famous leaks

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
like the WikiLeaks State
Department records:

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
this is thousands of times
larger than that leak.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The documents reveal
in graphic detail

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.127 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
how Mossack Fonseca set
up more than 200,000

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:27.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
companies, foundations
and trusts

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
largely in tax havens.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- In this parallel universe
where people want secrecy,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
they go to Mossack
Fonseca first.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.765 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Mossack Fonseca set
up the companies,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and then those
companies are used

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.228 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to basically open
up bank accounts.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And therefore the real
owner of the bank account

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
becomes anonymised by the fact
that it's an offshore company

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:50.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that technically owns the money.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:57.284 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
-  Mossack Fonseca: they're the
engineers who put together

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the wheels and the
machinery to make it work.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And they make sure that
it continues to work.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So they're very important.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And who is instructing them?

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.881 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It's going to be
the corporations;

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.883 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's going to be the
representatives

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:16.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of heads of state
who've stolen money;

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's going to be all
of the criminals

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.766 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
who want to hide money.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And as long as the firm is
not held to a standard

of serious due diligence
of who its customers are

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.525 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and what they're up to,

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.904 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
they keep this system
rolling right along.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Mossack Fonseca services
a myriad of clients.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.371 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the database are respected
global corporations

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and world leaders who have
assets in offshore havens.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- The current prime minister
of Iceland is in there,

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.587 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
with a company with his wife.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.714 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We've got the current
president of the Ukraine.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We've got the current
king of Saudi Arabia.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we've also got interesting
sort of asides like um,

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
David Cameron, the British prime
minister's, father's in there

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.641 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and in a rather
embarrassing way,

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.267 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
because he clearly was making

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a lot of money out of
the offshore world,

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
while his son is now campaigning
against tax havens.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.483 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It would seem almost impossible

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.276 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that they didn't know
who this guy was.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They would had to have
known who he was.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:18.448 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
-  There are also notorious
cronies and criminals

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who used Mossack Fonseca
to secretly organise

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
their business around the world.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.665 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We discovered their

a queen of the Latin

A cello player, but
the leaked files show

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
his offshore company receiving

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
millions of dollars

Hugo Jinkis and
his son, Mariano,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.756 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
two of the biggest sports
marketers in Latin America.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.677 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Both are charged in
the FIFA scandal

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:25.682 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
for allegedly conspiring to
solicit $150 million in bribes.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.063 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It is the corporate
use of this system

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:36.318 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that protects the criminals
who use the same system.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.528 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
The corporations say,

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"Look, what we're doing
is perfectly legitimate.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
After all, the OECD treaty
allows us to manoeuvre around,

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.997 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to have these
subsidiaries, to move

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the profits to
wherever we want."

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The same system is the
system that criminals use

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.715 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to hide the money
and to make sure

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.717 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that they're not caught
and they have no

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
responsibility for
what they've done.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.477 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- We soon discovered hundreds
of Australian passports,

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
names and addresses in
Mossack Fonseca's files.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They include corporate
giant BHP Billiton

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.487 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and some of our leading
foreign investors.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.534 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But we also uncovered convicted
fraudsters and tax evaders.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:30.413 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Mossack Fonseca leak
escalates the heated debate

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in Australia over tax avoidance.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
- Let's not
pussyfoot around it.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What is the business model
of these tax havens?

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
 Be it the Cayman Islands,
the British Virgins Islands,

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
be it Panama, the business
model is built around:

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:49.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"We will allow you to engage
in practices for a small fee

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.852 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that would otherwise be illegal
in your host country."

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
That's the business model.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
We estimate that
there's at least

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.692 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
21 to 32 trillion dollars

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:02.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of individual private
financial wealth offshore,

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
um, parked through havens.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:09.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That's just individual wealth;
that's not corporate money.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There's additional, you
know, trillions of dollars

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.332 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of corporate money
that flows offshore

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and is parked in low-tax
havens for tax purposes.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Given Panama's
colourful history,

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's not surprising
that a law firm here

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
has become a global leader
in the tax haven business.

This city is one of the oldest
tax havens in the world.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
At the height of
the cocaine trade,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Panama was a money laundry

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
for the Latin
American drug lords.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:04.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And it offered the full service:

It's not a crime.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But their business often moves
billions in tax revenue

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.203 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
out of the reach of
national governments.

- They're increasingly
using the best structures

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.086 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
on the planet and not
just Panama facilities,

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.129 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but they're based in
Panama because there is

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
relatively strong financial
secrecy in Panama.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
...and then they would wire
the money elsewhere...

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- As James Henry from the Tax
Justice Network explains,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
many wealthy individuals
and corporations

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.688 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
want a tax haven company to get
around the tax laws at home.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Well, usually we
refer to a tax haven

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
as a low-tax jurisdiction
compared to other places.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's a place that,
where non-residents,

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
either companies or individuals,

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:13.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
um, can take advantage
of the fact

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:15.829 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that they're not really
taxed on their income

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or their capital gains
or their estates,

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:21.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
even though they have
planted companies there.

Even in Panama, Mossack Fonseca

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
stands out among
other law firms.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It's setting tax
up haven companies

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.016 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
on an industrial scale,

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:40.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
through its 30 offices
around the world.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:46.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Co-founder Jürgen Mossack is
an expert in Swiss tax law,

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.988 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
with a glamorous Cuban wife
and unlimited ambition.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
My vision is that our company...

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and its various divisions

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:06.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
become an organisation
that is really, really

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
not only well respected,

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:14.846 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but which is an organisation
similar to, perhaps, Microsoft,

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:18.767 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
where people basically...
need us.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.605 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
His partner, Ramon Fonseca,

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:27.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is one of the best-connected
lawyers in Panama City.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:31.654 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Until recently he was a
special ministerial advisor

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.656 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to the Panamanian president

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:37.035 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and a top player in the
ruling political machine.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:42.665 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Mr Fonseca is the president
of the governing party.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:47.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Mr Fonseca was an advisor to
the president and as such he

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:50.632 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
basically advises the president
in whatever he's requested to.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Is that an influential position?

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Definitely he, you know, he
has the ear of the president.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Money laundering is a
big problem in Panama.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:09.776 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We are making corrections. We
are trying to restrict it.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.903 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
But it's still dragging on.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
There are still cases going on.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.741 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%

anti-corruption body,

Transparency International,

says despite Mossack Fonseca's
political connections,

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
its operations are
coming under scrutiny.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:30.171 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- If you're going to continue
in this industry,

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you know, you need
to know your client.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You need to make sure
your client is bona fide

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and is doing exactly what he
tells you he's doing with this

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:43.935 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and he's not using this company
for any criminal activity.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Mossack Fonseca's files
reveal its clients

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.071 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
 are under investigation
on four continents.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Its simple aim might
be to help people

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.451 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and companies
minimise their tax,

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.871 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but the leaked data
exposes a pattern

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:05.248 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of covert financial
manoeuvrings.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:10.753 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- Mossack Fonseca
can help people avoid

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the laws and the
regulations of countries

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that have the capability

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.304 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of collecting tax and
imposing liability.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.974 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And they are very
good at helping

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
people in that
offshore environment.

<i>SLOW SYNTH MUSIC</i>

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.779 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
One way Mossack Fonseca
helps its wealthy clients

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.783 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is by hiding their identity
in so-called shell companies.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:46.164 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
These companies hire
front men or nominees

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as shareholders and directors,

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.752 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
so the real owner
of the assets never

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
appears on a company register.

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- It depends on the game
that you're playing,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but ultimately you're trying
to avoid identification

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the ultimate beneficial owner
involved in these things,

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
so you can avoid liability.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.311 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Let's say someone borrows
money and defaults on it.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.188 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They want to escape
their creditors.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
They don't want to know...

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
want you to be able to
track them down.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
If they're dodging
taxes they're not

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
interested in the
IRS finding them.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So it's really a
game of, you know,

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.534 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
hide the peanut
under the shells.

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.454 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And, um, that's a
major part of it.

Mossack Fonseca's files,

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.964 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we found one network of
front men and women,

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:39.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
repeatedly used to hide
the identity of clients.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This network was not
based in Panama,

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.933 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
but on Queensland's Gold Coast.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The man behind it is Ian Taylor.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.857 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Ian Taylor is a
shady New Zealander

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
who moved to Australia
a decade ago.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:00.947 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
His shell companies have been
embroiled in a series of

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
scandals, including allegations
of money laundering.

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.787 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- Ian Taylor is one
of these people,

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.164 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and there are many hundreds
of them in the data,

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
where they literally
rent their name

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.169 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to pretend to be
directors of companies.

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:18.339 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So if you want to have an
anonymous offshore company,

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:22.301 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you'll need someone to be
your, basically your proxy.

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So Ian Taylor will
be the director of

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
thousands of companies
around the world

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%

what any of those
companies are doing,

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.034 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
- Taylor and his
father's business

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:13.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
had registered a local company
with nominee directors

at was exposed organising
an arms shipment

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.501 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
from North Korea to Iran,

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
both countries under
UN arms sanctions.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:25.133 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
After the initial shock
we went into I guess,

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a mode of, of trying
to figure out

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
exactly where we stand
with everything.

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:34.058 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- That really blew the lid on
the Taylor family enterprise.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It attracted a lot of
unwanted attention to them

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:39.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I believe that the
authorities in New Zealand

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.232 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
began to look at
their activities.

Major scandals involving
arms dealing,

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.153 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
um...

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%

about working with the Taylors.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:07.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The firm's executives
repeatedly backed the Taylors,

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:11.262 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
describing Ian's father
Geoffrey as a man of:

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:14.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- High credibility, professional
history and moral standard.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.268 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We have been cooperating with
his company for many years.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:28.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Taylor finally agreed to meet me
at a pub in Surfers Paradise.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.533 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He admitted acting as a nominee
director and shareholder

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:35.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
on hundreds of tax
haven companies.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:40.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But he also claimed his passport
and identity had been stolen

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:43.544 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and used to forge directorships
in eastern Europe.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:47.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He said he would explain
all in an interview,

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.134 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
but then stopped
taking our calls.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:54.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
- Ian Taylor and the
family always say:

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.515 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
well, you can't blame
them for any of this,

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because they don't know what
the companies are doing.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But they are actually
directors of these companies

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and they do have some
sort of responsibility

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to know what these
companies have been up to.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.655 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
 - Australian Federal Police
have recently questioned Taylor

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.282 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on behalf of Romanian
authorities.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But Taylor and his
proxies can escape

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
legal responsibilities for
the companies they front,

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because they operate
in the offshore world.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- What this really says is a
lot about the system itself

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.797 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and how broke the system is

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and how crazy the whole thing
is that you can do this.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:34.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean, you can have this
parallel universe and it exists.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.055 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And you've got all these
fake directors and all

these fake companies
and all this secrecy.

00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:27.888 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
original directors of
Wilson's holding company.

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:31.976 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They include two
billionaire directors

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:35.396 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
from Hong Kong, Raymond
and Thomas Kwok.

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In 2012 the Kwok
brothers, along with one

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:41.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of their top executives,
were charged

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:45.823 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in one of the biggest bribery
cases in Hong Kong's history.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:05.718 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- The charges hit as Wilson
Security in Australia

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
geared up to bid for
government contracts

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.435 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Definitely it shocked people,

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because the Kwok brothers
were very reputable

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and, um, many Hong Kong citizens
used to look up to them.

00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:23.527 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They were charged
because of bribery.

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:27.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But no one really knew which
one of the Kwok brothers

00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:29.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
 was actually behind this all.

00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:34.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Within a week of the
charges, the Kwok brothers

00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:37.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
resigned as directors of
Wilson's holding company

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:39.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the British Virgin Islands,

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:42.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
apparently cutting their
ties with Wilson Security.

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:46.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But two mysterious companies
then appeared as the

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:50.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
new directors: Harmony
Core and Winsome Sky.

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:54.475 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And we found behind
these companies

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
sat Raymond and Thomas Kwok.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:59.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They'd hidden their
directorships of the

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:02.024 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
company controlling
Wilson Security,

00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:04.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
with the help of
Mossack Fonseca.

00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:12.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Financial secrecy is the
essential piece of business.

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:18.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And the skills of the Panamanian
law firms are to figure out

00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:22.753 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
how to set up a trust here
that owns a corporation there,

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:26.006 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that owns another
corporation somewhere else;

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:32.221 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and create a series of layers
that make it very difficult,

00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
if not impossible, for an
investigator to figure out

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who really owns what and
where the money is.

00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- Wilson Security's
Australian executives

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.234 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
would not be interviewed.

00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:47.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But in a statement
they sought to

00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:50.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
distance the Kwoks
from the company.

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:53.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- Raymond Kwok is not,
nor has he ever been,

00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:55.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a director of Wilson Security.

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:58.288 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Thomas Kwok is not, nor at
any stage has he ever been,

00:24:58.288 --> 00:25:01.458 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a director of, nor has he
ever had any involvement in

00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:04.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
any Wilson company's
operations in Australia.

00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
<i>DRAMATIC MUSIC</i>

00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:13.804 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In December 2014
Thomas Kwok was jailed

00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:16.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for five years over the
Hong Kong bribery scandal.

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.687 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
His brother Raymond
was acquitted.

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:26.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
By then, Wilson Security had won
Australian government contracts

00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:30.279 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
worth more than 400
million dollars,

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:33.198 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
including sensitive contracts
that are supposed to

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
require tough probity rules.

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:40.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It seems ridiculous
to me that a company

00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:44.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that can take
hundreds of millions

00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:46.545 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
of Australian taxpayer dollars,

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in exchange for
locking up children,

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:52.176 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
doesn't require an
assessment of the character

00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:53.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the individuals involved.

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:57.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean, where else would
that be acceptable?

00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:01.351 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Well, this, this is a, a
fundamental question, which is:

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:07.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
why should the large countries
of the world accept as real,

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:11.987 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
entities that are set up on
a group of islands that has

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:16.116 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
fewer people by far than it
has offshore corporations,

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:20.704 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and has no real legal
system to monitor

00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:23.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and police what these
entities are up to?

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Um...

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:27.961 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That is really the
heart of the problem.

00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:31.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And what governments
should be doing is saying,

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:35.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
"We will not accept as
real, these entities.

00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:38.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You have to come here. You
have to incorporate here.

00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:40.808 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
You have to do it
under our rules

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:43.185 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and that requires
full disclosure."

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:46.772 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:51.819 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- While governments
insist they want

00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:53.779 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
to clean up the offshore world,

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:57.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the number of companies in
tax havens is exploding.

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:03.205 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That has a real impact on our
economy and our tax system.

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:08.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We only had to come down to the
famous Panama Canal to see that.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:13.882 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The company that operates
this crucial port

00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:15.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
at the entrance to
the Panama Canal

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:19.137 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is controlled by Hong
Kong's richest man.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%

Mossack Fonseca, here in Panama.

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:27.271 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%

His net fortune is estimated
at over 40 billion dollars

00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:46.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.751 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- Li Ka-shing, he's
the number-one

00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:51.253 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
richest man in Hong Kong.

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:52.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
And he's very wealthy.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:56.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He's a very powerful
businessman in Asia

00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:59.720 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and he's best known for

in Hutchison Whampoa Limited,

His company, Cheung

00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:37.586 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
almost 400 million dollars
in back taxes and penalties

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:40.422 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on their Australian
electricity business.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:46.303 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- That particular company had
blatantly, it appeared, ignored

00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:48.972 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
its obligations under
the Tax Act to

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:51.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
lodge either returns
or documents,

00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:53.393 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
or it had filed a
return that the

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:55.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Tax Office was
dissatisfied with,

00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:58.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which appears to have been
the first year's return.

00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- We asked a former
senior official

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.616 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with the Australian Tax
Office, , Martin Lock,

00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:10.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to explain the extraordinary
court ruling.

00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:14.414 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Obviously in frustration
the Tax Office finally issued

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:18.376 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
assessments which the company
obviously didn't even act upon,

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:23.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because the ATO had to
take this matter to court

00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:26.927 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to get a judgement debt
against the company.

00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:29.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In your experience, is
that pretty unusual

00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.015 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
for a large corporation
to do that?

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:35.435 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That's very unusual for a
large corporation to do that.

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:37.479 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Um... that...

00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:41.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
appears to show just blatant
disregard for the law:

00:31:41.108 --> 00:31:42.692 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
a blatant non-compliance.

00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Li Ka-shing's companies
quietly settled the case

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:51.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
with the Australian
Tax Office last year,

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:54.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
for less than one tenth
of the original claim.

00:31:55.956 --> 00:32:00.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
CKI executives refused to be
interviewed by Four Corners

00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:02.212 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
about their tax
haven arrangements,

00:32:02.212 --> 00:32:04.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
but issued a statement saying:

00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:07.092 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- All our companies
fully comply with

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:09.469 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
regulatory, tax and
legal requirements

00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:11.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
of the countries
they operate in,

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and Australia is no exception.

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:19.271 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Deputy Tax Commissioner
defends the settlement,

00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:22.482 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but laws on confidentiality
of corporate taxpayers

00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:24.568 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
mean he can't discuss it.

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:29.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- I'm really unable to
comment on anything

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:31.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that wasn't on the
public record.

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:37.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Settlements are very important
in the Australian tax system

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:41.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because they allow us to
secure the right amount of tax

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:44.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
without having to go through
a whole court process.

00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:46.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
To paraphrase Lewis Carroll:

00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:49.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
this is a case of
curiouser and curiouser.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Here is a company which has
been subject

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.100 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to a ruling of almost
800 million dollars

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in back taxes, in
underpayment of taxes.

00:32:59.603 --> 00:33:02.689 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Then it was quietly settled
a year or two later

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:05.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for a fraction of that:
something like 10 per cent

00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:07.485 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of the total amount
being sought.

00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:10.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What I think this
highlights is the need for

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.283 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
greater transparency
in these settlements.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:16.286 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
<i>SYNTH MUSIC</i>

00:33:18.538 --> 00:33:21.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- In the British Virgin
Islands it's obvious

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:24.044 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
financial secrecy
is a big problem.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:27.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You only have to see the
rows of post office boxes

00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:30.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that line the back streets
to realise no company

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:35.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
actually keeps any significant
records in this tax haven.

00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:37.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It's just a letter drop.

00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:41.353 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And that makes it tough
for tax investigators.

00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:46.107 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The fact is that they don't
hold any information

00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:49.694 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
because the companies running
through those havens,

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.613 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
they might run through them

00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:54.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but they don't leave
any information there.

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:59.788 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So then you have to see
through these havens

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:02.332 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to try and find out
what's really going on.

<i>TRAFFIC</i>

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.216 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%

didn't want us filming here.

Behind me is the

headquarters of Mossack Fonseca.

00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:19.099 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In this modest building
they manage to act

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
as the registered
agent of literally

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:23.103 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
thousands of companies;

00:34:23.436 --> 00:34:27.065 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
among them, some of the biggest
operators in Australia.

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:32.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
 BHP Billiton has
used Mossack Fonseca

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:35.532 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as its BVI agent for
companies linked to its

00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:39.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
diamonds, steel and
aluminium businesses

00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:43.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%

its finance arms.

The files show five
BHP Billiton finance

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:50.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
companies were
registered in BVI,

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:53.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
moving billions of
dollars in loans through

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:56.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the tax haven,
organised from London.

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The company is a
UK tax resident...

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:03.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The Deputy Tax
Commissioner won't

00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:06.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
comment on BHP
Billiton specifically.

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.774 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But he explains why
some multinationals put

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:12.861 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
their inter-company loans
through tax havens.

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
You loan money to
your Australian

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.491 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
company through a
low-tax jurisdiction.

00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:24.122 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You charge interest: that's
a deduction in Australia.

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:28.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That amount of money would
have been subject to tax

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:30.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
at, say, 30 per
cent in Australia,

00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:32.756 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
but it leaves the country

00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:36.176 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it may have a withholding
tax, say, of 10 per cent,

00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:39.554 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but when it gets to the tax
haven it may have a tax,

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:42.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
it may be taxed there
at, say, one per cent.

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:46.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So your overall tax burden
becomes 11 per cent,

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:48.355 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
 as opposed to 30 per cent.

00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:51.149 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
That's essentially why you go

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:53.526 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
through what's
called a tax haven;

00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:55.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
what we call low-tax
jurisdictions.

Each of these companies

subject to UK tax on
its worldwide income.

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:29.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Consequently, any profits
made by these companies were

taxable in the UK at the

the company had avoided
millions in tax by

00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:04.889 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
using a so-called marketing
hub in Singapore.

00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:06.933 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%

come before a Senate inquiry
about tax minimisation

come to this inquiry...

00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:59.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- Coinciding with the
Mossack Fonseca leak,

00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:03.781 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it's expected to reignite
public anger over tax avoidance

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
by corporations and
wealthy individuals.

00:38:06.743 --> 00:38:09.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Do you not know? Or
you're not telling us?

00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:11.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- I think that we've
reached a tipping point,

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:14.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that people are
really mad as hell

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and they don't want
to take it any more;

00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:18.004 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that this is an opportunity
to open this up.

00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:20.548 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And this issue won't go
away until there is a

00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:22.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
fair rate of tax being
paid by these companies.

00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- I have no idea what
you're talking about...

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.347 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
- Oh come on...
- and...

00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:29.766 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Frankly, to the
justification that's provided

00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:31.601 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
by a lot of these
companies that:

00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:33.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"Well, we're technically
operating, we believe,

00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:36.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
within the law, so
that makes it OK",

00:38:36.356 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you know, I think we have to
call that for what that is,

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and that's bullshit.

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I mean, that is a
bullshit argument.

00:38:41.528 --> 00:38:44.822 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The reality is that
they are operating

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:47.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in a very, very grey
area of the law.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You know, this isn't
a victimless act.

00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.038 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Every dollar that's
minimised is a dollar

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:55.542 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that's not going to a school,
that's not going to a hospital,

00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:59.003 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that's not going to a service
that we require and need.

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:02.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And yet these companies
are getting away with it

00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:04.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and we're letting them
get away with it.

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:09.013 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
- Public anger is
putting pressure

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:11.474 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on the Australian Tax
Office to step up

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:13.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the fight against tax avoidance.

00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:17.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And tonight Four Corners
can reveal tax officials

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:21.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
have got their hands on some of
the leaked Mossack Fonseca files

00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:26.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for its high-profile tax evasion
taskforce, Project Wickenby.

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:31.536 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Our analysis so far has
shown a number of people

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:35.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
who are either in our Wickenby

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:39.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or our wealthy Australians
investigation programs,

00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:41.796 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
have come up. So there is
some...

00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- Have come up in the
Mossack Fonseca data?

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
- Yes, they have. Yes.

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:47.719 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
People who are involved
in these sorts of

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:50.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
secret arrangements to evade
tax,

00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:53.141 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they need to consider their
position very carefully,

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:56.144 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
bearing in mind that
in recent years

00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:58.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
46 people have been sent to jail

00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:01.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
as part of the Wickenby Program.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.778 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's clear that there's
a great groundswell of

00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:09.449 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
resentment of these tax
evasion activities,

00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:13.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because we continually receive
information from informants.

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:18.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We've received information
since, err,

00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:21.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the company you're referring
to on other companies.

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:25.465 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
And so the...

00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:28.468 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I don't think you
can rely on these

00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
secret arrangements
being kept secret.

this unprecedented exposé

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.099 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
was to send out its PR man.

00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:28.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- Our detailed questions
were never answered.

But Mossack Fonseca denies
it ever acted illegally.

- We follow both the letter

Turning a bright public

a fairer and cleaner

00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:10.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
There's really
only one solution,

00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:12.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and that's to change the laws.

00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The Parliament has
to change the laws

00:42:14.907 --> 00:42:16.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
if it wants a particular result.
