>> So I'm an academic
internal medicine doc.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a professor of medicine
at the University of Iowa.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely believe
in science, in drugs,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
When I was diagnosed with
relapsing-remitting multiple

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
sclerosis in 2000, I sought
out the best MS center

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
in the Cleveland Clinic,
saw their best people,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:84%
took the newest drugs,
and treated my disease

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:90%
very aggressively.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Still within three
years, I had converted

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
from relapsing-remitting
to progressive.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
apparent that I was

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
headed towards becoming
bedridden and quite possibly

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
demented by my illness.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And I redesigned my diet.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
The magic begins.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Within three months,
my fatigue is gone.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:90%
My brain fog is gone.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I can stop Modafinil
or Provigil.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
In six months, I'm walking
around without my walking

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:90%
sticks or canes.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I no longer need my
tilt recline wheelchair.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
In nine months, I bike around
the block for the first time.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
In 12 months, I do a 18-mile
bike ride with my family.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:84%
This really changes how I
understand disease and health.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm discovering that
people are responding

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:90%

epidemic proportions.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
By some estimates, autoimmune
disease affects about one

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:90%
in five.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
When you add in other chronic
illnesses, about 75% of us

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
are unhealthy.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%

it's supposed to be.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We're clearly in a
epidemic because the quality

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
of our diets is
steadily declining.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> These are day-to-day,
hour-to-hour diseases that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:84%
create a serious burden on
individuals and families.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're all having a
different level of motivation

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.042 align:middle line:84%
at this point to do
something different.

at these feared outbreaks

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
on other continents
when really we

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
should be screaming
from the rooftop

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, chronic
diseases are on the rise.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have the
ability to change that.

you will find that the health

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of Americans has been worsening
over the last 20 years.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.645 align:middle line:84%
And I think because the
primary driver is diet,

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the way in which
we need to find a way out.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
do we go to new places that
we've never seen before.

I'm an artist.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I make installations
and paintings.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I also teach at Portland
State in the art department.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I turned 40 this year in August.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And I got what they call
ulcerative colitis--

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
the lower left side
of my colon, 50 feet.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was pretty
mild, but mild is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
like a relative term when
you've sort of lived your life

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:90%
carefree.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
running to the bathroom

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and having bleeding
and stuff like that.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my work
is about taking things

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that have symbols of conflict
and transforming them,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
the idea of transformative
power of beauty

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:90%
and how do we connect past that.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It really gets to
you after a while.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot
of people don't realize.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.074 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize what I
was doing to my own body.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:90%
weight and a lower weight.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.815 align:middle line:84%
My cholesterol is kind of
low on the good cholesterol

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and high on the bad cholesterol.

I developed gastro

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
which are kind of hereditary.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%

very much exacerbated

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:90%

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It's why it's so frustrating

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with rheumatoid
arthritis about four years ago.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So most of my pain is in
my wrists and my ankle.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And wrists-- I'm very
limited in activities,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:90%
simple activities like yoga.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I was a huge yoga
person, and now I

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:84%
can't put any
weight on my wrists.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Being a nanny, I have to be
really picky about my families

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
about the ages because
I am unable to--

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for me to pick
up kids because my wrists.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't bend really
very far anymore.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't think you'd need
your wrists to hold a child,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
but you really do.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
affecting my work.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Recently, about 2
and 1/2 months ago,

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I started Actemra,
which is also biologic.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's an injection I
give myself once a week.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty scary-looking.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:90%
It's working-ish.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:84%

to the rheumatologists.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'm feeling a little bit
better but definitely not 100%.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:90%
I am going to give it a try.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to really
put my all into it

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:84%

I was having bleeding.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, I
got really frustrated.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was like
looking for answers.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:90%

>> The conventional approach
for a chronic disease is

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to diagnose and then immediately
treat with the medication.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we also
compartmentalize diseases.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:90%
So you treat by organ systems.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So as people accumulate more
and more chronic diseases,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
they have more and
more physicians

on more and more
different drugs.

They have so much other
education that they focus on.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Most medical doctors
receive four hours or less

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:90%
in nutrition.

information that has been

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:84%
included in medical school
curriculum has been very

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
biochemically-based.

does vitamin A or vitamin D
interact within a human system.

help physicians understand

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
the concept of
nutritional therapy,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:84%
which means that good nutrients
can reverse many kinds

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of chronic diseases in a
way that's very positive

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
for the patient without the
use of drugs and other things.

And I don't object
to the use of drugs,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
but there are ways
in which physicians

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
can help their patients by
helping the patient know

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
how important nutrition
is in their own management

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:90%
of their conditions.

being taught is if you fix

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
the root cause, which
is diet and lifestyle,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:84%
you could roll back these
progressive diseases.

August 5th, it was 15 years.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%

into bilateral loss

of the use of my
hands and inability

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%

doing the protocol.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And within 30 days, my
body started responding.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Miracles started happening.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.263 align:middle line:90%
I actually bought a new car.

and value in their
circumstances.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And with good fortune,
diet and lifestyle changes

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
will stop the decline and quite
potentially restore function,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
reduce symptoms,
allow them to reduce

the foods that you're used
to eating and especially like

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
foods have high fat or high
salt, those kind of foods.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my palate is geared
toward the typical American

diet.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%

the aha.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And they have to commit.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that that had ever

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:90%
happened until I was like, huh.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm eating this chocolate.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And probably in

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:84%
going to be in the bathroom
with severe symptoms.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
behavior mechanism

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:90%
like it's an electric shock.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It really gets to
you after a while.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The hardest thing will
definitely be, I think,

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the social aspect because
my friends are very social.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
They're, every day, they're
out doing something.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And usually, after some sort
of outdoor activity like a bike

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
ride or a hike or a
long walk with the dog,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
they'll meet up at Brother
John's or 10 Barrel

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:17.540 align:middle line:84%
or and have a couple
of beers and eat pizza.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%

information about where

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
the livers are
from or where the--

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they're from--

00:14:47.338 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I have heard that it's a
huge component of the diet,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
emphasis on meat and vegetables,
but also the organ meats

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
because there are some things in
organ meats that you can't get

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:90%
anywhere else.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:90%

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
They're on a non-GMO

>> Cool.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's where--

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
we actually switched to
them because of that so.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's hope it's good
because liver sounds

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.355 align:middle line:90%
a little hard to stomach.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people know they want
to or they should eat better,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:90%
eat healthier.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And if they had
access to whole foods,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
there really is
a genuine concern

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:90%
that the food won't taste good.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And if the food
doesn't taste good,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:90%
people are likely not to eat it.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this goes back to having
a little bit of inspiration,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
motivation, and risk in
the kitchen to cook again.

>> It's hard to make dietary
changes when you've been eating

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
a poor diet for your whole
life, and nobody's told you hey,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
this is actually putting you
at increased risk of disease.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're not really
there to tell people

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
they're doing something wrong
or that it's even their fault.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We are just providing
the information

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and giving them some
guiding principles

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
so that when they do
start to make the changes,

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:90%
it can come from within.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So we really want to highlight
this pathway to veggies

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and including healthy
fats with your meal.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> My colleague Dr. Julie
Briley and I developed the Food

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
as Medicine Everyday series
almost five years ago.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a 12-week, hands-on,
whole foods cooking

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and nutrition series
that is actually taught

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
by naturopathic physicians.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And every week, we build
on our nutrition knowledge.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.405 align:middle line:84%
Women should have no
more than six teaspoons

00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:90%
of added sugar a day.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And men should have no
more than 9 teaspoons.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So we need time to integrate
that information in order

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to lead to long-term habits,
and then the incorporation

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
of cooking meals together
is really important.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And getting people
to touch food,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:84%
see food, smell
food really helps

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to develop a healthy
relationship with food.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:84%

come into these Food
as Medicine Every Day.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of label reading
and nutrition knowledge,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:90%
it's an equal playing field.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been teaching this
program in very diverse

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
communities in Portland
for the last five years.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And most recently, we've been
in Coffee Creek Correctional

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Facility.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a women's
correctional facility

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.605 align:middle line:90%
located south of Portland.

00:17:37.605 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
In addition, a
lot of these women

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with worsening
diabetes, weight gain,

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and other health issues
while incarcerated.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, these are
women that are going home.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
They're going home
to their families.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
be rehabilitated.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
They want to cook well for their
family and their other family

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
members that might
have diseases.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.603 align:middle line:84%
So they truly really
need this information.

00:18:01.603 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you
look on your label,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a section called
Nutrition facts with all

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:90%
the numbers listed.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
why we don't actually

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
want to look at that
part of the label.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
The most important
part to look at first

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:90%
is actually the ingredient list.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's such an important,
crucial skill that people need

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.422 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:18:22.422 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And then we go through.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And we actually read
some of these labels

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and we see that one
soda is double or triple

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the amount of sugar that
you should have in one day.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
This is like
mind-blowing for people.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at yogurt labels
and processed food labels.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.922 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's truly such
an eye-opening experience.

00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> These are vanilla.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is 18 grams of
sugar, 15 grams of sugar,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:90%
17 grams of sugar.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
This one has some
maltodextrin in it.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
This one is actually pretty good
on sugar content for ketchup--

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.788 align:middle line:84%
only two grams of
sugar in a tablespoon.

00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:11.588 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Sweet, not very healthy.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
My blood pressure
is pretty high.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.222 align:middle line:84%
I think the last time that
I took it it was 125 over 85

00:19:29.222 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's elevated.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So I take a beta
blocker for that.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:90%
It's called Metoprolol.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so my goal with this project
is to get off that medication.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of the tools
are 100% pomegranate juice

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and hibiscus tea, which both
work to naturally lower blood

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.088 align:middle line:84%
pressure in place
of a beta blocker.

00:19:52.088 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:90%
What are the ingredients?

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it 100% pomegranate
juice, do you know?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Just juice from
ripe pomegranates.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
I'm looking for.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.355 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:59.355 --> 00:20:00.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Just nothing with no added
sugar or cherry juice in it.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.165 align:middle line:90%
>> That one is, definitely.

00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:04.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:20:04.965 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Glad we got it.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What physicians-- we get
very uncomfortable when a simple

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
solution fixes many
disease states.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
the simple solution

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
of a nutrient-dense diet
filled with vegetables,

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of the
toxic stuff, is

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the simplest solution for nearly
every chronic disease state.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:90%
It may not cure you.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But it'll certainly
reduce symptoms,

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:84%
reduce the need for
meds, often to the point

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
where you, if you
stay with it, you

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
can get off medication after
medication after medication.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was at my sickest,
I was pretty much bedridden.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:90%
I had lost my job.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I had been in the hospital
three times in six weeks.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
Hashimoto's disease, which

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
is an autoimmune thyroid disease
and celiac disease about 3

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 years ago after about
a year of declining health.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I got my
diagnosis, they just

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
told me to go gluten-free and
that everything would change,

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:90%
and I would feel totally better.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I actually felt a lot worse.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And I started to think,
well, maybe there's

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
something about my diet that's
really not supporting me.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:90%
And I did a lot of research.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I really came across
dietary modification

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
for people with
autoimmune disease.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was
totally shocking.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So I had been living
off of all of the foods

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that the experts were now
recommending that people

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:90%
with autoimmune don't eat.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And so those were things
like grains, legumes, soy.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And that was like
all I was eating.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to do
an elimination diet.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I removed all
of the gut triggers.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So I did the
autoimmune protocol.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And it totally
transformed my life.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And six months, I was
back to good health.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't say
everything was perfect,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:84%
but it was the thing that really
jumpstarted me on the road

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.252 align:middle line:90%
to recovery.

00:22:14.252 --> 00:22:16.717 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:16.717 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What we have come to accept
as normal is the steady decline

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
from the age of 18 with
worsening blood pressure,

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
worsening clogging
of the artery,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:90%
worsening mental capacities.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
When we quit eating all these
vegetables and start eating

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:84%
sugar and white flour, we
decrease the fiber content.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And we used to have 100 to 150
grams of fiber in our diet.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
maybe 15 to 20 grams.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're starving the
health-promoting bacteria.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So we've done a lot of
things that switched us

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:84%
from having a healthy,
disease-resistant body

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
for which our DNA programmed
us to an inflamed, sickly,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
disease-prone body by having
micronutrient deficiencies,

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
by having our gene
expression changed,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and by shifting which bacteria
and viruses live in and on us.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The microbiome is all of
the microorganisms that live

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:90%
on and within our bodies.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so there's about 10
times as many microorganisms

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.043 align:middle line:84%
that live in our bodies as there
are cells of our own bodies.

00:23:35.043 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we understand

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
is that we have this symbiotic
relationship with them.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
We provide a lovely home for
all these microorganisms.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they directly
influence our health.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that is
the most important property

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:84%
of a healthy gut
microbiome is diversity.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So we want something like 500
to 1,000 different species

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
of microorganisms
growing in there

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:90%
in healthy relative quantities.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
There's certain things
that can actually

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
make the wrong types
of bacteria grow.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a system
that's out of balance.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
lack of variety

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:84%
that is one of the biggest
risks for chronic illness.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So we need to feed them
vegetables and fruit and nuts

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and seeds and
these great sources

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of nutrient-dense fiber,
lots of plant phytochemicals.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we can have this
healthy, robust variety

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
of microorganisms living
within our digestive tracts

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
living within our bodies
that are then providing us

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with all of these great
benefits like regulating

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So the gut microbiome beyond
influencing the immune system

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:84%
influences things
like brain health,

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:84%
influences how our
neurotransmitters are

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:90%
regulating themselves.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
They can change our hormones
and influence our hormones.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.728 align:middle line:84%
And we understand just the
tip of the iceberg when

00:24:52.728 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the gut microbiome.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We are starting
to understand how

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:84%
profound and far-reaching
their effects are.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you want to stir?

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Can you stir it for me?

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Sophia's into cooking herself.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:84%
She's really good at
telling me what I'm

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:90%
supposed to eat and not eat.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.496 align:middle line:90%
Right, Sophia?

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:19.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:25:19.296 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You're like, Mommy, are you
sure you're supposed to eat

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah, you're right.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It's actually pretty simple.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
People think that yogurt
is really complicated,

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:90%
but it only takes 15 minutes.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
chopping 3,000 vegetables.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot easier--

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you don't put
vegetables in here.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier than
making, like, vegetable soup.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Sophia, look at this.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:90%
This is what makes the yogurt.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:90%
It's called a culture.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like those,
my science kits.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, your science kits.

00:25:57.285 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Like when I started with
this healthy way of eating,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
my inflammation was like
60, which is really high.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.587 align:middle line:84%
And now it's gone
down to normal levels.

00:26:12.587 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Like at the end of the day,
I would come home from work.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And my lower back would be
paining and I'd have bleeding.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And now I can have a really
energetic day, like I

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
can go to the zoo with my kids.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:90%
I can go out in the evening.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So I can resume a normal
life, which last year was not

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So that has been
a major victory.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.534 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.534 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just
going to put this on top.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And it will be
ready in 24 hours.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.735 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you start
doing a dietary approach

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and a lifestyle approach, you're
providing the resources that

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
your body needs to heal and
the opportunity to heal,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%
which you get through sleep,
and you get through the hormone

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
regulation that comes with
stress management and activity.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.018 align:middle line:84%
So you get resources
and opportunity.

00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't have to place
a Band-Aid on the situation,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
The body has the
most amazing capacity

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to heal itself when
you actually give it

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
the resources and
the opportunity.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when we give our bodies
that chance to be healthy,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:90%
our bodies take it.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to just drug
ourselves up to not feel bad.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:90%
We can actually feel amazing.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:90%
So I used to be morbidly obese.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I had over a dozen different
diagnosed health conditions,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.880 align:middle line:84%
including three
autoimmune diseases.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was sick.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:90%
I was in pain all the time.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I had migraines.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
I had depression, anxiety.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any energy.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And I had two young daughters.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was right at the cusp
of this really high-profile

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
academic career without the
energy to be a career mom

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and without the energy
to try to balance what's

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:84%
necessary to run a
successful academic lab

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
in the current
funding environment

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and be the best mom that I
wanted to be for my children.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to take
time off of my career

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
in order to just do
one thing at a time.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was not
surviving motherhood.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:90%
I was getting sicker and sicker.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.970 align:middle line:90%
I was not getting enough sleep.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I was a wreck, and
I needed a solution.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So I started to apply
my scientific background

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
to my own health and
experienced absolutely

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:84%
what some people would call
miraculous health turnaround.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So within two weeks
of changing my diet,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I was able to discontinue
six prescription medications.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me back
something that I didn't even

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%
understand I could have again.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.365 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:03.365 --> 00:29:15.353 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm feeling better.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm sleeping really
well at night.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I sleep-- I used to wake up
like four or five times a night

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and just toss and turn and be
uncomfortable for the position

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:90%
I was in with my joints.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And now I sleep--

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll sleep the whole
way until the morning

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.680 align:middle line:90%
and maybe only wake up one time.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really awesome.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest
change that I've noticed.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So but yeah, energy levels
are higher definitely.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.885 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely energy and sleep
and I think overall mood too.

00:29:48.885 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel really
empowered and really

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:84%
excited to get up every
day and try new things

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.060 align:middle line:90%
and cook new things.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Here goes.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely not something
that happens overnight

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.870 align:middle line:90%
as I'm sure you guys know.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The American Heart
Association has shown that

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in 2014, we spend about
$1 billion every day

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
on cardiac-related
disease health care costs.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're expecting that
to double in another 14 or 15

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
years so that at around '25,
'26, then there's going to be--

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:90%
the cost will be twice as much.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be spending
$2 billion a day.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Taking care of someone
who has chronic heart

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:84%
failure, for example, or
coronary artery disease

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:84%
can be very expensive in terms
of surgeries or procedures.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, my view
is that we will not

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%
be able to sustain caring
for everyone who has it.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the compromise
we'll have to make.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have to give people
the best medical treatment we

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.325 align:middle line:84%
can without undergoing
all the procedures that

00:31:13.325 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
might be lifesaving because
I don't think we could afford

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to do it if that many people in
our population had the problem.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you look at the
statistics for something like

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disease, you've
got roughly 50 to 60 million

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Americans who are affected,
which is twice the number

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of Americans that are affected
by cardiovascular disease

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and four times the number of
Americans that are affected

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:90%
by cancer.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The CDC projects that one in
three people will have type 2

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
diabetes by the year 2050 if
we stay on this trajectory that

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.570 align:middle line:90%
we're on right now.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And that means we can't
stay on that trajectory.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if that
were to happen, it

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
would bankrupt our
medical system.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And the decreased worker
productivity is two to three

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:84%
times the cost of
the medical care.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Another sidebar is that
the lack of healthy workers

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:90%
will devastate our economy.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Even if you decide
we're not going

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to cover any of those health
care costs, that people--

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.710 align:middle line:84%
you're on your own
for that, we can't

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:22.520 align:middle line:84%
afford the drain on the economy
from lack of healthy workers.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What The Moore Institute
wants to do is to help people

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.600 align:middle line:84%
understand the process by
which poor diets actually lead

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:90%
to disease.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And that brings up
the word epigenetic.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics is
the modification

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.680 align:middle line:84%
of genes by what we
call the environment.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I'm
referring to nutrition.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:84%
The science that I was talking
about that we want to share

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
is based on discoveries
that have only been known

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:90%
for the last decade or two.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the nutrition
that a person gets when they're

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:84%
developing is what determines
their likelihood of having

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:90%
diseases when they're older.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So now let me explain the 100
year effect, how it works.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my 60's.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:90%
My mother is in her 90's.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the egg that
made me was made

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:84%
in my 92-year-old
now mother when

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:84%
she was a fetus in my
grandmother's womb.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And the egg that made me was
almost exactly 100 years ago.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm 100, and that
100-year life I've had

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:84%
has been dependent on my
grandmother's nutrition,

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:84%
on my mother's nutrition,
on my childhood nutrition,

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and now on my
nutrition as an adult.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.680 align:middle line:84%
If I can just give
you an example,

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
the way you get nutrients while
you're developing before you're

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
born will tell a growing
body how to turn on genes

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.210 align:middle line:90%
or turn off genes.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And if there is not enough
nutrients to grow well,

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:84%
then what will happen is
some of the genes that

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:84%
should be turned
on and operating

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:84%
will be turned down like a
dimmer switch on a light.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:84%
They'll be gradually turned
down by a mechanism called

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.940 align:middle line:90%
epigenetics.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:84%
And then later in
life, those genes

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.780 align:middle line:84%
will make a person more
vulnerable for having disease.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.679 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, many people
have said the problem

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.429 align:middle line:84%
with emphasizing this is that it
somehow blames mothers for all

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:90%
the disease that we have.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:90%
And that's really not true.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that the food
environment we all live

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:90%
is where we ought to--

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:90%
is the problem.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.159 align:middle line:84%
And if we have to
blame something,

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.280 align:middle line:84%
we should blame the fact that
the American population has

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:84%
allowed food industries to
determine our taste preferences

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and somehow keep us from
eating the kinds of food that

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:90%
would be healthy.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:55.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Last time I was
making goat yogurt.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was really enjoying that.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was still having
problems with some digestion.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I'm not doing
any dairy, yogurt included.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've also sort of started
pureeing my vegetables.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
it's going better

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:27.000 align:middle line:84%
with a more pureed
dairy-free diet.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I may have to go this
route for a while

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
until my body's like
totally more healed.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Like a typical
artist mentalities,

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:90%
I start sort of getting--

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I start speeding up and
then become more manic.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.985 align:middle line:84%
And every couple of days,
I'd have to go in for a yoga,

00:35:48.985 --> 00:35:53.440 align:middle line:84%
or I have to go in for
acupuncture or something to--

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:84%
somebody to jolt me back
to my baseline, which

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
in turn helps me make
better choices with my food.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Just trying out things like
that to manage my energy level.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I love the big picture.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.860 align:middle line:90%
The details are excruciating.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Right now I'm in
the midst of that,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and then I have to switch hats
and think about my big idea

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:90%
worth spreading.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.886 align:middle line:90%

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think this is the
beginning of a new movement

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.480 align:middle line:84%
in the prepared foods industry
and the restaurant industry,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:84%
one that really
says we need trust,

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and we need the maximum
amount of transparency.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:90%
People need to feel safe.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I do think it comes from
people being increasingly ill

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and realizing for the first time
that their relationship to food

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.930 align:middle line:84%
might participate
in their health.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But also I think because
of the health care

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:84%
system and the rewards that are
going into preventative care,

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:84%
people are taking more
initiative for their health.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We're at Dick's Kitchen,
named after me and functioning

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.120 align:middle line:84%
originally as my kitchen as
I lived upstairs for a while

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and was able to experiment
on this kind of a new idea.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I've got a couple of genetic
dice rolling against me having

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:84%
both a methylation
defect and a tendency

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.652 align:middle line:84%
toward either
pre-diabetes or diabetes

00:37:47.652 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I don't manage
blood sugar very well.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what
I eat is crucial.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:84%
My health concerns
are not unique to me.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got probably a double
or triple whammy going,

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:04.780 align:middle line:84%
but many folks have issues
that will be made better

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:90%
by much more conscious eating.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Dick's Kitchen is
really an effort

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to promote not just
healthier eating,

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:84%
but a healthier approach
to how we source our food.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:84%
The rest of our menu is
intended to create food

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.790 align:middle line:84%
that people recognize as their
favorite food, hamburgers

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and side dishes and potatoes,
but done with much more thought

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and much more balance in mind.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I interact
with people every day that are

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.330 align:middle line:84%
suffering needlessly because
of choices they're making

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.920 align:middle line:90%
because of convenience.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.683 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to help themselves.

00:38:45.683 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't available for
them to help themselves.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And they feel trapped by what
products are available to them

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:90%
in the grocery store.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Food is something that
can affect us immediately.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what's really
amazing is to give people

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that experience of just
having a cup of broth

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and noticing that
they don't have

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:90%
a sour stomach in the morning.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's just interesting
to see parents

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:13.170 align:middle line:84%
saying they've never seen
their children so calm,

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.870 align:middle line:84%
or they've never felt
like they slept so well

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
after a meal and not
a deep, vacant sleep,

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.880 align:middle line:84%
but a restorative, healthy
sleep, the kind you

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:90%
should be having.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how quickly
the body responds

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.380 align:middle line:90%
when it has the tools it needs.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think the tools that
are the most accessible

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.990 align:middle line:90%
for the body come in food form.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so the
Brooklyn house is,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
we call it European-style
comfort food.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So this lady would like
the pork chop special,

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:90%
but she's on the SIBO protocol.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we have
the parsley puree.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.892 align:middle line:90%
>> That we can do with her for--

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's no
garlic chunks in there.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no garlic chunks.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all strained.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:90%
So we're all good to go.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I often accidentally say
that our patients need this

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
or that when really
I mean our customers.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's because there are a
lot of naturopathic doctors

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and nutritional therapists
in this city who trust us.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.775 align:middle line:90%
They've been here.

00:40:17.775 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:90%
They've talked to us.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
They know why we're
doing what we're doing.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:90%
They know how.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.560 align:middle line:90%
They have that transparency.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they trust giving us as
a resource to their patients.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we provide here
is a truly holistic food

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.470 align:middle line:90%
as medicine experience.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:84%
You get both the foods
that are healthy for you

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and the treatment that
is healthy for you.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.638 align:middle line:84%
You get to invite
your whole family.

00:40:42.638 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And the family member who
likes the steak and potatoes,

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and the family member's
vegan, and the family member

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.090 align:middle line:84%
who has celiac disease
are all going to be fine.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And you with your
SIBO-specific diet

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.200 align:middle line:84%
can feel like you
just ordered a meal.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And so those patient--

00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:01.970 align:middle line:84%
those customers are the most
invested in this restaurant.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
They are personally invested in
the health of this restaurant

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
because it allows them a place
to go where they don't feel

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:84%
like a social outcast
for trying to heal

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.270 align:middle line:90%
their body through food.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The hardest thing to do
when you're introducing this

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle to people is to
get them out of their heads.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.710 align:middle line:84%
People are actually, I think,
very instinctive eaters.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And when their body
responds positively

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to a food regardless of whether
their brain is telling them

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be kind of weird
or unusual, they will naturally

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:34.220 align:middle line:84%
gravitate toward it as
a delicious experience.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Again, that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.970 align:middle line:84%
they're ready to jump into
eating a whole piece of liver.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But if we can prepare
it in a way that

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.970 align:middle line:84%
makes it more
accessible, we'll be

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.590 align:middle line:84%
able to offer them a
way to participate.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In the food business,
first and foremost,

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.460 align:middle line:84%
it's just gotta be
a satisfying meal.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.740 align:middle line:84%
No matter how healthy
you think you are,

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're not enjoying it,
you're not likely to return.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So we have to balance
creating a great environment

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and a welcoming
environment for folks

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.020 align:middle line:84%

Our fears-- I have been
not sleeping enough,

so that's having a little
impact on my bowels.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still holding
on to my diet.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I haven't really gone and
gotten a chocolate bar.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's good
is I'm shifting away

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:90%
from emotional eating.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.880 align:middle line:84%

need to like still

People have to realize that it's
just not their own discipline

for eating better food,
which is important,

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:29.020 align:middle line:84%
but we need to find ways in
which eating healthy foods is

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.332 align:middle line:90%
really the cultural norm.

00:45:31.332 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%

ways to go to do that.

asked about food culture

because I think that that's
the important piece that's

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:90%
been missed.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We talk about individual
responsibility.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:84%

are doing what they're doing.

give credit to the fact

that we live within a
culture that is telling us

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:84%
how we should think and
feel and act in regards

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:90%
to health and wellness.

No, bring donuts in.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Pizza, obviously.

Like can we get salad?

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

White lettuce and croutons
and cheese, Caesar salad.

Like yeah, great.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:84%
White lettuce or
plain iceberg lettuce.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like an effort to
actually do anything healthy

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate
world and in the work

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.570 align:middle line:84%
world, which is where most of
us spend so much of our day.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:40.338 align:middle line:84%
If there's not a lot
of support there,

00:46:40.338 --> 00:46:42.005 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
tough to make change.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Diet-wise, there's
still a challenge.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I still have unfortunately like,
incredible levels of stress

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:54.870 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.960 align:middle line:84%
My brother has been staying
with us for the past two months.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really big
source of tension for me.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we were trying
to buy a second house.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.130 align:middle line:90%
And we pulled out of that.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just been a very,
very busy and challenging time

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.930 align:middle line:84%
on top of things with
work and other things

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:16.965 align:middle line:90%
and Tyler's school.

00:47:16.965 --> 00:47:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to,
like I told you

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.940 align:middle line:84%
before, I've been able to go
for like a week, like two weeks.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But then like when I fall off,
like I fall off really hard.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult,
especially with the boys.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.805 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to eat out quite
a bit because of our schedules

00:47:36.805 --> 00:47:37.680 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that
has been the biggest

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.680 align:middle line:84%
barrier to being able to
successfully implement

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.630 align:middle line:90%
these things is eating out.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm still working on
the day-to-day choices,

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:84%
like I'm trying to have at
least one paleo meal a day,

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:90%
two paleo snacks a day.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.690 align:middle line:90%


00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And that I've been
successful with.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I tend to feel a whole
lot better when I'm

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:90%
adhering to that type of diet.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.120 align:middle line:90%


00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It feels like every time
we meet, I say this,

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:21.200 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like things are
going to start slowing down,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Kind of letting my
brother stay with us

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.390 align:middle line:90%
and trying to get into this--

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.140 align:middle line:84%
buy this second house
and things like that

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.210 align:middle line:84%
were kind of just kind
of shooting myself

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:37.120 align:middle line:84%
in the foot for being
successful with this.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.610 align:middle line:90%

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It really is these chronic,
lifestyle-based diseases that

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:84%
are really taking the
greatest toll on our health.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And the United
States is actually

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest sufferers
of these chronic diseases.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So despite the fact
that we have access

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:24.740 align:middle line:84%
to incredible modern
medicine, we're

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:29.120 align:middle line:84%
ranking pretty poorly compared
to our fellow countries

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how we're
managing the load,

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:90%
the burden of chronic disease.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty serious, I'd say.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What we have come to accept
as normal is the steady decline

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:47.120 align:middle line:84%
from the age of 18 with
worsening blood pressure,

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.100 align:middle line:84%
worsening clogging
of the artery,

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:56.690 align:middle line:84%
worsening mental capacities when
in fact what is normal is fully

robust health,
physical capacities,

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.370 align:middle line:90%
mental capacities into our 90s.

>> Your diet actually has
to be a lifestyle choice.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
to look at when we're

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.770 align:middle line:84%
giving individual
recommendations to patients

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
is we need to look at
their stage of life,

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and their disease process,
and their health goals.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.000 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at if they have
a food sensitivity or a food

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.080 align:middle line:90%
allergy.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, we
also need to think

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:84%
about their cultural upbringing,
their ethical choices

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.360 align:middle line:90%
around food.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And then also and very
importantly, their access--

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.400 align:middle line:84%
do they actually have access
to this healthy, healing food?

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.473 align:middle line:84%
And so all of those things need
to be taken into account when

00:50:40.473 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you're working with
a patient and trying

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to get them on the right path.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And what is optimal
for each of us

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
little bit different

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and is probably going to be
a moving target because how

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.990 align:middle line:84%
our bodies respond to food is
dependent on how much sleep we

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.790 align:middle line:90%
got.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:90%
It's dependent on our stress.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.845 align:middle line:84%
It's dependent on exactly what
our gut microbiome is doing.

00:50:58.845 --> 00:51:00.470 align:middle line:84%
It's dependent on
the last time we were

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.195 align:middle line:90%
exposed to a virus or bacteria.

00:51:03.195 --> 00:51:04.820 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
things that influence

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.500 align:middle line:90%
how we respond to foods.

for understanding
how to choose a food

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and then providing a framework
from which people can start,

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and then experiment
to figure out

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.320 align:middle line:84%
what is really optimal
for them, and what

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.315 align:middle line:90%
makes them feel the best.

>> I have gotten
off track for sure.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I've just been
dealing with that, I guess.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I've been not-- I can definitely
tell a difference in how

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:59.910 align:middle line:84%
my body feels when I was
on track versus to now

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:01.170 align:middle line:90%
that I'm off track.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Just things were
better, little things

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that I think affect the
condition like sleep.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping a lot better,
and energy, and not even

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:18.180 align:middle line:84%
the specifics of the actual
disease or the condition.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:22.290 align:middle line:84%
It was just those little
things that I noticed a lot.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.690 align:middle line:90%
And the big one is pain.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:26.730 align:middle line:90%
It's back.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, I haven't been
back to my functional medicine

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.685 align:middle line:84%
doctor because
for a while there,

00:52:32.685 --> 00:52:33.810 align:middle line:90%
I was paying out of pocket.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
My insurance doesn't
cover functional medicine.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I was paying
out of pocket.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, it just
got to be too expensive

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:45.600 align:middle line:84%
because I was paying
hundreds of dollars

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:90%
in vitamins and supplements.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And every time I went,
it was more tests.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And insurance wouldn't cover
this test or that test.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it was definitely
starting to add up.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Right now what's
holding me up is

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting lots of information
from just which diet

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:05.470 align:middle line:84%
to follow because now I'm
hearing that meat is not

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.790 align:middle line:90%
good for arthritic conditions.

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went to an
iridologist in town.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And she was amazing.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.525 align:middle line:90%
And she's a recovering--

00:53:13.525 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:90%
guess she's not recovering.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.260 align:middle line:84%
She's in remission from
her rheumatoid arthritis.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And she is very adamant about
following a strict vegan diet.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I definitely felt
like I was confused.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm still confused.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:31.510 align:middle line:84%
That's another one of the big
reasons why I'm struggling

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.870 align:middle line:90%
right now is I'm confused.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And especially when you yourself
are Googling, that's the worst.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, those are vegan ones.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:45.886 align:middle line:90%


00:53:45.886 --> 00:53:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Yum.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You can still find good
information on the internet,

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:56.290 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a skilled eye to
be able to sift through all

00:53:56.290 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:84%
the information and
pull out the pieces.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So I do think you can get some
information from the media.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But if it's specifically
related to your disease state,

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking about
making a big change,

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I think you do need to seek out
a health care professional that

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:16.510 align:middle line:84%
has that training and that can
work with you along the way.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I think you often do
need support and guidance

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and practical information
to be successful.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
understand what's

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:34.640 align:middle line:84%
keeping you from getting to the
between the I'll try and I can?

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I've made a huge amount
of changes in this year.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I do feel like I
feel like I'm doing my best,

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's still
not good enough.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is
so upsetting me.

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's like--

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what?

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I've done all this stuff.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know what's--

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.682 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's like it's
still the same thing.

00:54:53.682 --> 00:54:58.884 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something
right now that--

00:54:58.884 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it's
just also kind of--

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing
is, like you said,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.440 align:middle line:84%
like you have to
accept that you're not

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to go
back to that lifestyle.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have to accept that like,
OK, you've done all this stuff.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of
what you're doing.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to get
you back to eating ice cream.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And not that you want to eat
ice cream in the first place.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.220 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
where you have to go.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:26.797 align:middle line:84%
And you know what, everybody
goes through a mourning

00:55:26.797 --> 00:55:28.200 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Everyone does.

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.865 align:middle line:90%
And you have to go through it.

00:55:30.865 --> 00:55:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to let
yourself go through it,

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be angry
about what you're giving up

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:37.280 align:middle line:90%
because you are giving up.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And then once you get past
that, you'll be the next point,

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:45.390 align:middle line:84%
where you'll realize what
amazing things you gained from

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you will.

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I know you will.

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Even with a restricted
diet, your lifestyle

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.680 align:middle line:84%
is actually going to be
opened up because you're

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.330 align:middle line:90%
going to be healthier.

00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:00.810 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to eat an
immense amount of variety

00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:03.600 align:middle line:84%
once you get your
inflammation down.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically I was
just lying there.

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I was putting my
18-month-old down.

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, it
wasn't vertigo,

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.730 align:middle line:84%
but it was just
like I heard a pop,

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and then just everything
shifted 90 degrees.

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:25.570 align:middle line:90%
It was really strange.

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Like not my viewing angle
or anything like that,

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.125 align:middle line:90%
but it just felt like--

00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of your center of
balance was totally shifted.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I think it was
more of a situation where they

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.010 align:middle line:84%
really wanted to just rule
everything out because the way

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that the symptoms were a little
bit all over the place, an

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.920 align:middle line:84%
could have aligned with
something that was worse,

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.420 align:middle line:84%
which also kind of fueled the
anxiety and the not knowing.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think going
through that process

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and then eliminating
things, in the end,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.040 align:middle line:84%
helped because then
it gets you realizing

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.230 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't these things
where it could've been.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was pretty much in the
emergency room all day that

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Saturday.

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had a CAT scan.

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I had where they inject
you with the iodine

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Not a pleasant feeling.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:14.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't want to
get, obviously a bad prognosis.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.035 align:middle line:84%
But I was hoping that
he would tell me,

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:84%
you gotta start
doing this or you

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.280 align:middle line:84%
gotta start doing that
because it's, you know.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely a
motivator, absolutely.

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It's been kind of night and day
as far as heart palpitations

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and really good as
far as the reflux.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But when I do go off and
I'm not eating paleo,

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.530 align:middle line:84%
then the reflux kind
of comes roaring back.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think the night that
I had the heart palpitation,

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I was having some
reflux symptoms as well.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of maybe
related to that.

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I think I was a
little naive on how

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.110 align:middle line:84%
big of an adjustment
or a change it

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:01.980 align:middle line:84%
would be, especially with things
like my work schedule and stuff

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.780 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I've got to
learn some strategies

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:84%
for when things don't
go according to plan,

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.286 align:middle line:90%
how to keep it all together.

00:58:16.286 --> 00:58:18.726 align:middle line:90%

00:58:18.726 --> 00:58:32.890 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to both change
the education when it comes

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:84%
to food, and change
the food supply,

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and change how
our food is grown,

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and change our access to food,
and change the cost of food

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:47.500 align:middle line:84%
so that healthful foods are
the ones that are subsidized,

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.400 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a problem with so
many different moving parts,

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and it requires
us as a community

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.830 align:middle line:84%
to really demand that all of
these different moving parts

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.070 align:middle line:90%
are addressed.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The truth is that we now
have people in Oregon and across

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.910 align:middle line:84%
the country are suffering
what we call high calorie

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:11.150 align:middle line:90%
malnutrition.

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I feel sorry for people
who are in this condition.

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't blame them because
our food culture has driven us

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:22.420 align:middle line:84%
to the place where the only
access of affordable food,

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.060 align:middle line:84%
for many people, are
high calorie foods that

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.976 align:middle line:90%
don't have nutrients.

00:59:27.976 --> 00:59:31.399 align:middle line:90%

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.792 align:middle line:84%
>> The prevailing wisdom is
that we have an obesity epidemic

00:59:43.792 --> 00:59:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people who are
having trouble managing chronic

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:50.030 align:middle line:84%
conditions, and that that is
largely due to high calorie

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.460 align:middle line:84%
malnutrition, where someone
is getting a whole lot of fat

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and sugar, but not the nutrients
they need really to stay

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:55.920 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And so in that case,
prescribing vegetables

00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.735 align:middle line:90%
might be appropriate.

00:59:59.735 --> 01:00:01.610 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, when
someone's having stalled

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:06.560 align:middle line:84%
healing due to malnutrition,
especially if they're

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.900 align:middle line:84%
low income, the problem might
be protein in their diet,

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that they're just not
getting enough protein

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to grow new skin, and
therefore they can't heal.

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we
started our first program,

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:17.900 align:middle line:84%
was in what we now call
curative nutrition dosing.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding folks who have
stalled healing with wounds

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.465 align:middle line:84%
or burns or surgical
incisions who

01:00:24.465 --> 01:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
aren't able to get better
because their body just doesn't

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.410 align:middle line:90%
have the nutrients to do it.

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we prescribe
them a limited course

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of nutritious food that is
tailored to them specifically,

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
the right amount of grams
of protein and calories

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.950 align:middle line:90%
for each meal.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And they eat it and get better.

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:44.590 align:middle line:90%


01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The social determinants of
health make up about 70% to 75%

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
of what is a person's
personal health picture.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
ordinarily, a physician

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:04.600 align:middle line:84%
can't impact very
much for his patients.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But they can impact the
nutritional picture in the home

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:18.590 align:middle line:84%
by addressing food
security in the clinic.

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Providence has adopted
a particularly deep set

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
of interventions, and so they
screen for food insecurity

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.830 align:middle line:90%
because it's quick and simple.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But then, if a person
is food insecure,

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
they're matched up with
a Health Navigator who

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
assesses their full situation
that has patients walking out

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of a clinic with
some new resources

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.410 align:middle line:90%
to help improve their diet.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
When I started in
April of 2014, there

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
was one clinic
screening in Oregon,

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:53.992 align:middle line:90%
and now there are over 200.

01:01:53.992 --> 01:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of my patients who
have done it so far have really

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%
found that things have improved.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.890 align:middle line:90%
So let me know how it goes.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it's
been really helpful.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.382 align:middle line:84%
And thanks again
for being honest.

01:02:06.382 --> 01:02:09.280 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So from the top down, our
medical decision makers really

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.610 align:middle line:90%
have kind of a blind spot here.

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:16.568 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
for programs like this

01:02:16.568 --> 01:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to fill that blind spot and
to inform our system of what

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.521 align:middle line:90%
could be and what should be.

01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:21.994 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:21.994 --> 01:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%


01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pretty exciting.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
We got this idea when we
learned about My Street Grocery,

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
we got this idea
to write a grant

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
through our Good Samaritan
Foundation, which

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation
here at our hospital.

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So we decided we
wanted to write a grant

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.375 align:middle line:84%
to get vouchers to help people
shop for healthier food options

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because what we
were finding was,

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
as our physicians would
go into the exam room

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and talk to someone
with congestive heart

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.880 align:middle line:84%
failure or diabetes, and
the physicians would say,

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
you need to be eating
healthier, eat more vegetables.

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And the patients would look
at him like, you're crazy.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get $180 a
month in food stamps,

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and I can't afford
that kind of diet.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Upon coming here, I had a
very unique experience with

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
a patient and was counseling
them on dietary choices

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:15.460 align:middle line:90%
for their diabetes.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at and
said, are you crazy?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a rich man's diet.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't eat those
things and pay for them.

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And she went to the canned food
store and things like that.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of
started me on my quest

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.140 align:middle line:90%
to do a project like this.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, it's not
only bringing the food

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.540 align:middle line:84%
to a population that really
needs to have better access,

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's a more well-rounded
approach to access because it

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
means relationships that are
already built in and that trust

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
between patient and
provider and social worker.

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's also financial access.

01:03:55.050 --> 01:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It's dietary information
specific to medical conditions.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say that bringing
the food into the community

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.238 align:middle line:90%
is not the end of our work.

01:04:06.238 --> 01:04:07.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning of our work.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So we bring the food, and
now with this partnership,

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
we provide more resources
that truly make it accessible.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> All the patients
have to do is show up.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.003 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to have
an appointment on Tuesday.

01:04:18.003 --> 01:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So usually they're
told by their physician

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
or they're referred off
to a Good Sam campus.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
jump through any hoops.

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We made it as
simple as possible.

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And they come and meet
either Scott or I,

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the social worker or I,
and they get $15 a week,

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
three $5.00 vouchers weekly.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And by bringing My Street
in, we bring in what we know is

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
a healthier food selection.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
If we just gave them $15 a
week to go shop at Safeway,

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
they might go buy
processed, prepackaged foods

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and the inexpensive
stuff that they're

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
used to buying because
that's what they can afford.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So here we know they're
getting fresher,

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
organic, healthier food
items in their shopping.

01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:07.612 align:middle line:84%
>> So these food programs are
important because they are

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
treating the immediate
needs of patients.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.000 align:middle line:90%
They're improving lives first.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.780 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're important.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.738 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, they're
important because they're

01:05:14.738 --> 01:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
making a case for food
to be used as medicine.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, they're helping
insurers and regulators

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
understand the
role that food can

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
play in how we can
save money and reduce

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
suffering with a
small resource that's

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.565 align:middle line:84%
already available
by just applying it

01:05:29.565 --> 01:05:30.440 align:middle line:90%
in an innovative way.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%


01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Adelante Mujeres has
been around since 2002.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And we started out first
with our education programs.

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that we were
seeing over the last 10,

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
now 12, 13 years, is that the
mujeres, the women that we

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.910 align:middle line:84%
see in the program,
their health has

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
changed a lot over that
generation of students.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:10.678 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:06:10.678 --> 01:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Because most of our
patients come from Mexico,

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.770 align:middle line:84%
their basic diet
is really healthy.

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They eat beans and rice and
tortillas and delicious mole,

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and they do a lot
of physical work.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.180 align:middle line:90%
They walk places.

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
They exercise on
a regular basis.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
to this country,

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.900 align:middle line:90%
and there's a wealth of options.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of those
options are really not healthy.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And so a couple of years ago,
Adelante Mujeres really wanted

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
to make a concerted effort
to not only address food,

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:47.280 align:middle line:84%
but exercise, stress relief,
all sorts of holistic parts

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of health.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>> One of those initiatives
that we're doing is this great

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
collaboration between Adelante
Mujeres and Virginia Garcia.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
This prescription program
involves the provider

01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
being able to say, hey, you've
got a family member who's

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
at risk, either because
they have diabetes

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
or they have hypertension
or they have obesity.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Would your family be interested
in getting some education

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.587 align:middle line:84%
around healthy eating, learning
how to prepare healthy food,

01:07:12.587 --> 01:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and then getting a voucher
to go to the farmer's market?

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I have several
of my families

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that have participated now
have for a second year,

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
making great strides

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in making healthier
choices and having access

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
to that fresh local produce.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We are working
with Virginia Garcia.

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor recommends
the patient with us.

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So we are in this in this group
where we have the classes.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And this class is every
month, one time every month.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And they receive $6.00 per
person in the house per week.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And they can spend that money
at the Forest Grove Farmer's

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Market.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Another part of the structure
of our program has been to have

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
consistent relationships, so
the folks that they're seeing

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
in these monthly meetings
are the same staff that are

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
at the farmer's market that can
help them navigate once they

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.210 align:middle line:90%
get there.

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:13.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, we did that thing in class.

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
find it in the market?

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm searching for this
type of chili or something.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Or do you know a farmer
that has this or that?

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:24.359 align:middle line:84%
And so feeling confident
that they're going to,

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
when they arrive at
the farmer's market,

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
have someone to also be there
to kind of be a support when

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:34.822 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to find
whatever, or feel more welcome

01:08:34.822 --> 01:08:36.030 align:middle line:90%
when they come to the market.

01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:38.939 align:middle line:90%


01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>> They're enjoying
eating more vegetables.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we can also
follow their metrics.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, when they come into
the clinic, we weigh them,

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:48.467 align:middle line:84%
we check their blood pressure,
we check their blood sugar.

01:08:48.467 --> 01:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to see small
but steady improvements

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.229 align:middle line:90%
in their health.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.479 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're getting
the whole family involved

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
because even if it's a mom who
has diabetes or is overweight,

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
we know that their kids
are at risk as well.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the more
vegetables and fruit

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that's brought
into the household,

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.433 align:middle line:84%
the healthier they're going
to get used to eating.

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:08.020 align:middle line:90%
So that works really well.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:17.399 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.729 align:middle line:84%
>> I think with a community,
there's really nothing worse

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
than feeling really isolated and
alone and like you're the only

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.058 align:middle line:90%
person doing something.

01:09:26.058 --> 01:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
a community, you're

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
really motivated
to stay on track.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So when I was really sick, I
had a very small community,

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
maybe three or four people that
I was talking to almost every

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.630 align:middle line:90%
day.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:39.689 align:middle line:84%
And when they had successes,
even if I wasn't experiencing

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
success, I was so motivated to
keep doing what I was doing.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.529 align:middle line:84%
So starting the
blog was basically

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:49.979 align:middle line:84%
my outlet to start
talking about what

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I was going through with
people that also had

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
personal experience
with it because as much

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.935 align:middle line:84%
as my husband loves me, and he's
interested in what I was doing,

01:09:58.935 --> 01:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
he didn't want to hear
about it day in and day out.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really
understand what it

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:04.482 align:middle line:84%
felt like to be going through
what I was going through.

01:10:04.482 --> 01:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So that was a really
big outlet for me

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:11.730 align:middle line:84%
as far as just sharing
what I was going through,

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and then being able to
connect with other people who

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
were in a similar boat, and
also just kind of figure out

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
what they were doing and
if it was working for them,

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and try and refine what I was
doing and what I was learning.

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, I do try to
do a lot of community building

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
because I really believe
that the people that

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
are able to be successful find
community, and have friends

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
that can keep them
accountable, and can

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
have social gatherings with
and kind of commiserate

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and collaborate with.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So I try to share a
lot of that on my blog,

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
too, to help people
connect with each other.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.303 align:middle line:90%


01:10:53.303 --> 01:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Environment is
super important,

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.578 align:middle line:84%
and that translates to
the house, the home,

01:10:57.578 --> 01:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
wherever that might be, whatever
that looks like for someone.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.677 align:middle line:84%
If the people in your household,
your immediate nuclear family,

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
whatever that might look like,
if there's not a lot of support

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
there, that's going to
be tough to make change.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.555 align:middle line:90%
So that's tough.

01:11:11.555 --> 01:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the
environment that you

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:17.095 align:middle line:84%
are in socially outside of work,
what are those people doing?

01:11:17.095 --> 01:11:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Where are they going?

01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:19.940 align:middle line:90%
How do they support you?

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Oy, that's really hard.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So if we had a
culture of support

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
for everyone to do the
best that they could

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
rather than this judgment that
continues to happen almost all

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:31.652 align:middle line:90%
the time, it'd be a lot easier.

01:11:31.652 --> 01:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So what people have
said about the groups

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.235 align:middle line:84%
that I run, the food
story groups that I run,

01:11:35.235 --> 01:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
is that these groups
are the only place

01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
in their entire
lives where they can

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
have the conversation
about food and food story

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.803 align:middle line:84%
and body image and
fitness and wellness,

01:11:44.803 --> 01:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
where they know that people
understand what they're saying

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.807 align:middle line:84%
without them having to
explain it in great detail

01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:50.640 align:middle line:90%
because they get it.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
They're living the
same sort of stuff.

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's really
helped you, the diet?

01:11:55.180 --> 01:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it has, when I'm on it,
when I'm doing it religiously.

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It's been a struggle, for sure.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So Adam hopefully will make
it, but he may not make it.

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:08.820 align:middle line:84%
His life has just gotten crazy
busy this morning with work

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and he had to take off
to work, unfortunately.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
You need community, you
need your tribe who really

01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
get what you're going through.

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
That's so necessary
for people to succeed

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
because so often, they
feel like, again, I'm

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:26.143 align:middle line:84%
the only one who can't
get my act together.

01:12:26.143 --> 01:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one who doesn't have
the smarts or the information

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.450 align:middle line:84%
or the wherewithal
or the motivation

01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
or the willpower
to make this work.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Then you go sit in a
group of six people,

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and they all go, oh,
yeah, I totally get that.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm the same way.

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
And you go, oh, wait.

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm totally normal.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
There are people who get
what I'm going through.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going through
what I'm going through?

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Whew.

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the best thing,
and this is the hardest thing,

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
is the empathy for yourself
when you do fall off the wagon

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and you do screw up,
the empathy for that.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.728 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's really there to be,
like, hey, you know what?

01:12:56.728 --> 01:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't even get it.

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't even realize
it's really hard to be

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.450 align:middle line:90%
in your shoes and my shoes.

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Having a supportive community
actually directly improves

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.510 align:middle line:90%
our health.

01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So having a supportive community
actually changes our hormones.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So it changes things
like cortisol.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It changes how our bodies
are responding to stress.

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:19.860 align:middle line:90%
It changes things like oxytocin.

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.550 align:middle line:90%
It's called the love hormone.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we are feeling
connected and supported.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we are producing
more oxytocin, which

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
is anti-inflammatory and helps
regulate the immune system.

01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It helps set up the
situation in our bodies

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.050 align:middle line:90%
where our bodies can heal.

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So having a sense of
community and support

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:39.600 align:middle line:84%
has been well-established
in the scientific literature

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
to improve health outcomes.

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And so when we have
that, we don't just

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
have the practical part of this
person who understands what I'm

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
going through, this person
who is a cheerleader,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.820 align:middle line:90%
or a shoulder I can cry on.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But then we get this
wonderful hormonal response

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to having that community
that by itself helps speed up

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
our healing and
promotes better health.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's absolutely fundamental.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I was super secluded
in the beginning,

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.560 align:middle line:90%
and it made me really bummed.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.635 align:middle line:90%
So I just put myself out there.

01:14:14.635 --> 01:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny
because I had met you

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
before at Mickey Trescott's
book talk at Natural Grocers.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
We sat beside each other,
because I recognized you.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I had really fast
success with it.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
By November 2013 was
my last MS flare.

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I made it a year and a
half with no flares at all

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
until I accidentally ate one
bite of gluten at a restaurant,

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and I lost feeling in
my leg for three months.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And it is just now coming back.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's definitely comforting
to feel that you're not alone

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in this.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Beth has definitely inspired me.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I love her story, and it's real.

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It's real evidence.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't had
an actual huge flare-up,

01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
so I haven't been able
to experience that.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.010 align:middle line:90%
But she has.

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's a real.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Thing this whole thing with
diet and body, it's real.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I love that
I found someone

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
so close to me that
has put themselves

01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.580 align:middle line:90%
into remission through diet.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
That's so inspiring
because it's a long road

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's so frustrating.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And you are definitely--

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I've been tempted to give up.

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when you have
a friend and a success story,

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.807 align:middle line:90%
it definitely keeps you going.

01:15:30.807 --> 01:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I really
had to think about it,

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of how much joy do I get from
being in a restaurant to how

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
much joy do I get chasing
my kids at a park?

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I get way more joy chasing my
kids at a park than I do eating

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.738 align:middle line:90%
in a restaurant.

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:46.970 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So I was on prednisone for three
and 1/2 years, 10 milligrams

01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
a day for the first two
years, and then the last year

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.830 align:middle line:90%
was five milligrams a day.

01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
half year, I was just

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
going down every month five
milligrams, four milligrams,

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
three milligrams, two
milligrams, one milligram.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm
completely off of it.

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good
feeling because I

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
was really nervous about
the long-term effects

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.310 align:middle line:90%
and prednisone.

01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:14.110 align:middle line:90%
So.

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:16.670 align:middle line:90%


01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I like them, too.

01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm used to the tartness
and the natural sweetness.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I feel like we really do--

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.030 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
effort that we put.

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
We're like hard workers, us
people with disease and dietary

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.600 align:middle line:90%
restrictions.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.892 align:middle line:90%
We're like the hardest workers.

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:42.570 align:middle line:90%


01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the net gain from
having more energy and feeling

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
healthier has really been a
plus for us and had a positive

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
effect on our lifestyle.

01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's been
about two months

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.680 align:middle line:84%
now of cutting out sugar, where
before, my husband can tell you

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd add sugar.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.688 align:middle line:90%
>> You can see it right here.

01:17:02.688 --> 01:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, still
have it over here.

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is kind of
probably bare minimum.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
She used to have
the big syrup pumps.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, every morning.

01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is more now on hand
for guests or something,

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:15.350 align:middle line:90%
or just kind of left over.

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a real difference
in my energy level.

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that now when
I do have some sugar,

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it a lot more.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.242 align:middle line:84%
>> She's lost almost 10 pounds,
and I've lost almost 10 pounds.

01:17:29.242 --> 01:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But she's lost a lot
of inches and things

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.600 align:middle line:90%
like that because of sugar.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> When we sat down and
talked about how can we make

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.120 align:middle line:84%
a lifestyle change for our
family versus how can you make

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
a change and how
can I make a change,

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.710 align:middle line:84%
then it made all the
difference because before,

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
he would be doing something, and
I would half do it or this sort

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:48.330 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But once we sat down and said,
well, what will work for us?

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:52.672 align:middle line:84%
How can we meal plan
together so that it

01:17:52.672 --> 01:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
makes sense for both
of us, or how can we

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%
encourage each other?

01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It made all the difference.

01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, once she's kind
of been on board and kind

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
of eating the same lifestyle as
me, it's helped tremendously.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.930 align:middle line:90%


01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of an update
from me on the medical side.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So I have been able to
discontinue seeing my specialty

01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:middle line:90%
cardiologist.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So my heart palpitations
have decreased

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to the amount where it's
usually about once a week,

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe once every
eight to nine days,

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
whereas I used to have
them multiple times a day.

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And my blood pressure
is in control now.

01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
It was high on the
systolic range, I believe,

01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:43.480 align:middle line:90%
and now it's under on both.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.258 align:middle line:84%
Adam, can you say
hi to the camera?

01:18:45.258 --> 01:18:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Apple cider vinegar?

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:51.602 align:middle line:90%


01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.020 align:middle line:90%
I made all this.

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:08.420 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Identity is like a window that
frames our view of the world.

01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We can handle something
suboptimal better if we have

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
all the nutrients available
to help process that.

01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So we can handle
a stressful event.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.800 align:middle line:90%
We can handle a late night.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.630 align:middle line:84%
We can handle exposure to a food
that normally would be really

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.860 align:middle line:90%
inflammatory for our bodies.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.660 align:middle line:90%
We recover faster.

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And so having an overall
nutrient density focus

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.640 align:middle line:84%
in the diet becomes
the foundation

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.500 align:middle line:90%
of a diet that supports health.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The inflammation
has gone down a ton.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't have as much
pain in all of my body.

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's been making
my mobility better.

01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's making my
energy levels go up,

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
just my mood, my
sleep, everything

01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:59.170 align:middle line:90%
has gotten so much better.

01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say I'm
down about 15 pounds.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And then just little things,
like my skin has cleared up

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot, and other things.

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not as anxious.

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Things are better,
and things are improving.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're working with a
slightly modified treatment

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
plan, which is more of the
same, like staying with my diet,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and staying with
my healthy yoga.

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> People are saying, we want
time with our physicians.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We want more office time.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We want education
about prevention.

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
We want education
about food as medicine.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the medical
community has a lot to learn

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
about how important
nutrition is.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
keep meeting people

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
who are senior level doctors
in medical institutions

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
who are like me, who
have come to realize

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
how important nutrition is
and are actually using it now.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Just working with my
doctor, test results,

01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
really seeing how the foods
impact my body and my blood

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
pressure and my A1C and
those type of things.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad that I worked
on the first diet and failed

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's given me a lot more
drive and a lot more incentive.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just trying
to keep on track,

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and trying to not
diverge off of that.

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And the process is
not linear, I think.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> These stories are like
windows into our past,

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and I need to share this
knowledge with my children.

01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And I ask you to do the same.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And this will become a source
of learning for generations

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.210 align:middle line:90%
to come.

01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:39.432 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to be playing soccer,
playing music with my children,

01:21:39.432 --> 01:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
grandchildren,
great grandchildren,

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
in my 80's and 90's, and
preferably when I'm 100.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm getting my
health under control.

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
step I wanted to take

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.410 align:middle line:84%
before I could move on
to the next step, which

01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:56.280 align:middle line:90%
would be having a family.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, once you
start to see a success,

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.865 align:middle line:84%
then you start to
get the motivation,

01:22:00.865 --> 01:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy to keep it going.

01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning,
it's hard, right?

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.540 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that I
have a lot of hope

01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:11.470 align:middle line:90%
for my journey going forward.

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I can still have a fulfilling
life and actually make these

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
changes, and I don't have
to go back to that old--

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's not the
goal of getting healthy.

01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the meantime, I say,
go home and cook a healthy meal

01:22:25.210 --> 01:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
in your home with your family
because that's what you can do

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.440 align:middle line:90%
today, what you can do now.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And this isn't like
a cute Portlandia joke.

01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:35.530 align:middle line:90%
This is real, and it matters.

01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really changed
my life for the better.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- almost
saved my life.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm still on my journey.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
This is maybe the
end of the film,

01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the end
of my journey for me.

01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We can all find our path
forward by breaking out

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
of our boxes, by painting
and reclaiming our cities,

01:22:56.470 --> 01:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and recording the lost stories
in our community because when

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
we look out our
window of identity,

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:08.264 align:middle line:84%
we are all under
the same blue sky.

01:23:08.264 --> 01:23:09.248 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:09.248 --> 01:23:16.630 align:middle line:90%


01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And we need the public
to share the message that

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.680 align:middle line:84%
they're learning as well so that
we can affect as many people

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.250 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe
that that compounds

01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
on an exponential level,
on a community scale,

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that if we can heal
ourselves, if we can feel good

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.660 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, then
we want to share that

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.670 align:middle line:84%
with our friends, our
family, our community.

01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a lifestyle.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a lifelong commitment
to health, and it is a journey.

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But we all have to come to
this place in our own way.

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We all have to come
to it at our own pace.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The future of health care is
teaching people how to create

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
more and more health
in their lives.

01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
That is the future
of health care.

01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And whatever
profession will best

01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:03.310 align:middle line:84%
deliver that will be the health
care profession of the future.

01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we don't have to wrestle
so much with what we're going

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to do with all these people
who are going to get chronic

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.990 align:middle line:84%
disease because chronic
disease will disappear.

01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
possible for us to do

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.020 align:middle line:90%
if we have the will to do it.

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.770 align:middle line:90%
