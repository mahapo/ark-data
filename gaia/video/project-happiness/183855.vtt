00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, when I started, I thought
maybe it would be a movie

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.303 align:middle line:90%
or a website.

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Why don't we start
even before all of that?

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Start with why.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I started the project because
I wanted more happiness

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in my life and in
my kids' lives.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.115 align:middle line:84%
But I realized I didn't even
know how to talk about it.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Sitting around
the kitchen table,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:84%
my own daughter told
me "I'm stressed out.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to be happy,
and I don't know how."

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
That was the start
of my journey.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered is
that happiness can be taught.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.994 align:middle line:90%

>> Any questions or any
argument, or any criticism,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.862 align:middle line:90%
most welcome.

00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:25.945 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to be
transformed in this process.

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:27.653 align:middle line:84%
As much as you want
to help other people,

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:30.822 align:middle line:84%
this process is going
to inform your lives.

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:33.364 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the greatest decisions
you can make in your life is

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:34.697 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to do with it.

00:01:34.697 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> For some, it's
easier than others.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
In our society,
depression is on the rise.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.676 align:middle line:84%
And teens are
especially susceptible.

00:01:46.676 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:90%
But there is hope.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:18.253 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
When I started the project, I
had heard really good things

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:84%
about this teacher
named Ward Mailliard

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
at a small private school up in
the mountains near Santa Cruz.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So Randy came to
sit in on a class.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
normal day for us.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But what I saw coming from
the kids and the interaction

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
between him and his
students just blew me away.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The quality of creative
thought, of self reflection,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly what
I was looking for.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I connected Ward with some other
unique teachers I had heard of,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
a young principal
in Nigeria named

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Emmanuel and a
first-grade teacher

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
named Yeshi at a school for
Tibetan exiles living in India.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
The kids started talking
with each other by email

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and sending videos and really
getting to know one another.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what if we
could put our heads together

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to make something that
we could then share

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.445 align:middle line:90%
with other kids, other schools?

00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And what if we could get
kids talking together

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
about real ways to have more
happiness in their lives?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> An individual requires an
opportunity or an experience

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
to understand their potential.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think this was an
experience for all of us.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> We try to take advantage
of the human situation,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
because we know that
everybody wants to be happy.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Everybody needs compassion.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants to be loved.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Things that are very, very
fundamental to human beings,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:90%
inescapable.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:90%
We can't run away from them.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> People have always
told me to be special,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and I find it weird that I
don't feel special at all.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.403 align:middle line:90%
More happiness.

00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I really don't
know where I was born,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
but I was born in
India, for sure.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.995 align:middle line:84%
But I have no idea,
because I'm an orphan, so.

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Ever since I was little,
I've moved around from school

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:90%
to school.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I guess I don't really allow
myself to become attached

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to any place or look at
it as the only place I'm

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
going to stay, because, I
mean, nothing is forever.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll be happy at some point.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope it'll have
an impact on me,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
because everyone really
wants to be happier.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Happiness can be elusive.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.175 align:middle line:84%
With an increase in depression
comes an increase in suicides.

00:04:46.175 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really stressful,
trying to keep myself as myself.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
what to do about it.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I was six when my mom died.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
She came home from the
hospital with my little sister.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her complaining
about her back hurting

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and her head hurting.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
home from school,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and the ambulances
were out front.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a nice
story to think about,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
like the whole "you'll
see them again in heaven"

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that,
but I don't know.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>> My father has been in the
hospital for quite a while.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
He had a seizure
in June, and he was

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital for
pancreatitis and died from that.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately I have
no control over that,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:90%
but I have to deal with it.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I just didn't
want to be who I was.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely tried really
hard to be somebody else,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and it just didn't work for me.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And then my past started
haunting me like no--

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I just didn't
know what else to do,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.975 align:middle line:90%
and I started cutting myself.

00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think I have
this personality,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that if I start something,
I get really addicted to it.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I would do 20 cuts
everywhere, each day.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think I took some
rat something, ant killing

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.202 align:middle line:90%
poisoning thing, something.

00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And my social worker was like,
"Wow, you're not going home.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.118 align:middle line:84%
You're going to a
mental hospital."

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And then I was like, "Wow."

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a child of
divorced parents,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and I recently decided
to live with my father.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you just took my box.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Watch me cry.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a really
hard thing for me,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
being able to feel
vulnerable around my dad.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I never felt that he would be
able to accept me if I gave up,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be able to feel
that he'll always love me.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, if this
can teach me anything,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
hopefully it's to be able
to talk to my father.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we
get some answers?

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to bring some other
voices into the project,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:84%
so we were looking for people
that the kids connected with.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Luke had just written an
essay comparing the Jedi code

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
with the principles
of the Dalai Lama.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And we were really fortunate
to be able to sit down

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:90%
with George Lucas.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:90%
We're going to see George Lucas.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see one
of my idols, someone

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.065 align:middle line:84%
that I watch on the
"Star Wars" VHS and beta.

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you want the lightsaber?

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Do you want me to?

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
This guy created some of
my favorite characters.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:90%
This guy created my imagination.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid who grew
up on "Star Wars."

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.612 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess this is the hot seat.

00:08:12.612 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.702 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:08:15.702 --> 00:08:16.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:08:16.502 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, George.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:90%
It's me, Luke.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Luke.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.512 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:27.512 --> 00:08:29.272 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.272 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I was just wondering, how did
you put your own spirituality

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:90%
into your films?

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And even, did you put
your own spirituality,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
or is it just something
that came to you creatively?

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, creatively, or
spiritually, or intellectually,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
you are your work, which is,
it's very hard to separate

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
the artist from what he does,
no matter who it is or what

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:90%
they're doing.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the creativity is so
interconnected with your inner

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
being that it reflects
you as a person.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to know a
person, a filmmaker, or any kind

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.222 align:middle line:84%
of artist, really, but
especially a filmmaker,

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
you can understand
a lot about them

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.888 align:middle line:84%
just by looking at their
work, and you can understand

00:09:11.888 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:90%
what kind of a person they are.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I'm Madeline.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.505 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think are the
things which most contribute

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:90%
to long term happiness?

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, happiness is the result
of a combination of pleasure

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:90%
and joy.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Short term happiness, which
is pleasure, is self-centered.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
getting something.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And so by its very
nature, short termed.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's by its very
nature, it's additive.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Which means that if
you do something once,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
say you buy a car, the first
car you buy is fantastic.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing experience.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:90%
You get this thing.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
The second time you buy a
car, it's not so amazing.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have to buy a
bigger, fancier car in order

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to get the same experience as
when you bought your first car.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps going down
until you have six yachts, 12

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:90%
airplanes, and 50 cars.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And even then, that
experience with those

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
will not equal the first
experience you had,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:90%
but joy is different.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Joy really has to do with
taking care of other people

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and doing things for others
rather than for yourself.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
reality of why

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
we're here, that one of
the greatest pleasures

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:90%
is making kids.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest joys, or the
greatest joy, is raising kids.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And kids-- kids, I say children.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But children teach
you compassion.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:90%
They come out.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.292 align:middle line:84%
They're half an hour
old, and they're

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:90%
already wiser than you are.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And what they know
how to teach you

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
is how to have
unconditional love, how

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
to be completely absorbed
with another human being

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:90%
and devoted to that human being.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And the joy you get from
them, and if you say,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
"Gee, if I treated
everybody the way

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I treat my little
six week old baby,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:90%
then I would have a lot of joy."

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to babies to
do it, but that's the hard way.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:90%
The easy way is to have kids.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have a
choice You have to love them,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:90%
because they're very cute.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Until they turn into teenagers,
and then this other miracle

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
happens, where when they're
ready to leave and say

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:90%
"I'm out of here.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to be
independent," they get

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:84%
all gawky, and pimply, and ugly,
and they're not cute anymore,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
so the parents are just as
willing to say, "OK, go off,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:90%
have your life."

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:90%
But that's a true miracle.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.537 align:middle line:90%
I hope that answered something.

00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We wanted to get a
scientific take on happiness,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
so Luke and Nina went to
Seattle to talk to Dr.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Richard Davidson, one
of the world's leading

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:90%
neuroscientists.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.032 align:middle line:90%
>> And speed and Luke, 1, 2, 3.

00:11:59.032 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What's your definition
of lasting happiness?

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Or not definition, what's your--

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
what brings you
lasting happiness?

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what brings me lasting
happiness is to do the work

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing and have
it help others.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:84%
From very early on,
I had the conviction

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is
something that is really

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:84%
important to our well-being
and our happiness,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and that if we can all improve
our minds in certain ways,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
our well-being would
improve, and the world

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:90%
can really be a better place.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So I very quickly got involved
in neuroplasticity research.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity
is a word that we

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
use to describe the
fact that the brain can

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
change in response to experience
and in response to training.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:90%
This is really a new discovery.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
We even have learned that
we grow new brain cells.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the mechanisms
of neuroplasticity.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
We once thought
that the brain was

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:84%
different than any other
organ in the body, in that it

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:90%
didn't grow new brain cells.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But we now know that that's
just totally wrong, that we

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
do grow new brain cells.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:84%
An average adult grows about
5,000 new cells every day.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And that provides the
scientific underpinnings

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
for understanding
how training our mind

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.377 align:middle line:84%
can actually produce
enduring changes.

00:13:26.377 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If you could just pick us
all up and shake us and say

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.835 align:middle line:84%
something to us to make us
happier and make us less

00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:90%
depressed, what would it be.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that to
appreciate the fact that all

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
of us, and youth in particular,
are in a constant state of flux

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and change, and that gives
you radical possibilities

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:90%
for growth and development.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Kids often get stuck in
patterns of self identification,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
where they're identifying
with a particular subgroup.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
They have a clique of friends
that they're hanging out with.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:84%
They listen to a
certain kind of music.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:90%
That's their identity.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
difficult to see change

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:90%
when you're in the middle of it.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So who you think you are
at this point in time

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily who you're
going to be in the next moment.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> As a producer, I've done
some films with the Dalai Lama

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, and I thought, why
not try to have the students

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and their teachers discuss
happiness with the Dalai Lama

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
himself?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I think his message reaches
across all kinds of boundaries.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And that really gave us
a good place to start.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
We asked for the
interview, and he said yes.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The product is
the journey here.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
By us engaging and making a
commitment without any sense

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that anything is going
to come back from it.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And my hope is to
go on the journey

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and to see how we're
changed by the journey.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.386 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm looking forward to it.

00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

>> The second group of kids we
were taking to visit the Dalai

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.158 align:middle line:84%
Lama were Emmanuel's
students from Nigeria.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The students here in Nigeria
on this project have been

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
making contributions about the
understanding of happiness,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
what makes them happy and
what makes them not happy.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Happiness, in my own opinion,
can be defined as a state

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
of being glad or happy, or it's
an inner expression of a good

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever I help someone and
I make them feel they are human,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:90%
it makes me happy.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I succeed
in whatever I'm doing,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:90%
it also makes me happy.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There's one thing that I
know I'm not really happy about.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Like here in Nigeria, we have
so many people suffering.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
If they don't go to school,
to join up with armed robbery,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:90%
corruption, so many things.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nobody
to take care of them.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm praying to God if
you can just make me great,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.964 align:middle line:84%
I'll try my best to meet
people's needs, too.

00:16:24.964 --> 00:16:25.764 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:25.764 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody in the
world, wherever you are,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
we are talking
about universality,

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:84%
whether you are in the
US, you are in Nigeria,

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
you are in Ghana, Jamaica,
and whether you are black,

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
or white, or green, or blue, no
matter the kind of human being

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
you are, we naturally
want to be happy.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What makes me happy is when I
see I performed well in school.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Some girls, they are
working on the street.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anybody
to pay their school fees,

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
but I'm happy that
me, I'm in school.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Just being with my friends
and then telling jokes

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:90%
to others.

>> When there is singing,
I feel very happy.

what do you see exactly
that makes you so happy?

00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Doctor.

There is no human
being who is Perfect

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
the problem is that our
pursuit of happiness

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
is actually based on what
we understand by happiness.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, our
understanding is limited.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And because it is limited, we
search for happiness wrongly.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
General happiness is
lasting, and unchangeable,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:90%
and originates from within us.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Patience,
compassion, empathy.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And without happiness,
you can't have patience,

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
because when you're not happy,
anybody that offends you,

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:84%
you will definitely
offend that person back.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So without happiness,
you can't have patience.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Happiness is love.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is compassion.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And happiness is peace.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Because like just a
family, when there

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.065 align:middle line:84%
is no happiness in the family,
there will not be peace.

00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
each other,

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
compassion between themselves.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you want to be happy,
based on our own definition,

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
you have to show love.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:84%
If you show
compassion, you are not

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
happy to see other
people suffer.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
When you see people in
need, you help them.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And love is directed
towards fellow human beings.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever been sad?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So what made you sad?

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:90%
That is one.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And how did you feel
when you were sad?

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> The day I lost my dad.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I was very sad, and
I feel like joining

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:90%
him, feel like killing myself.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> We share the same experience.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
In a way, the pain of losing
a dad is not just a dad.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
The death of any human
being affects us.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
poem by John Donne?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:84%
He says "Everyone's
death diminishes me,

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:90%
because no man is an island.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.653 align:middle line:90%
We are part of the whole."

00:19:10.653 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The third group of students
participating were from

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan Children's Village,
located in the town where

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:90%
the Dalai Lama now lives.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of my students,
they're from Tibet.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But when I joined TCV, I
was not at all a Tibetan.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Right from childhood, I
stayed among the Indians.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I never had Tibetans
as my friends,

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
so I could not speak in
my language fluently.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, I
conversed with my parents

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in English, or
sometimes in Nepali.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Ask me some questions.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any message
to the California students?

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to tell them to
stop visiting McDonald's quite

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:90%
often.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of my students
say, "Ma'am, I

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
haven't met my parents for the
past 15 years or 20 years."

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
when I heard them

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
say that, I thought they were
exaggerating, because I was

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
thinking, how can they not meet
their parents for the past 15

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:90%
years or 20 years?

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But the closer I got
to the community,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the more I started knowing
about the hardships they undergo

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
when they come to India.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:90%
There are no legal permissions.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:90%
That's why the escape.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They've crossed such
dangerous places

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that probably we in our wildest
dreams would never think of.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's so funny.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they look so happy,
and when you watch them,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
you can never imagine
that they've gone

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:90%
through this in their life.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I cannot walk a mile,
and I think, "OK,

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
maybe I should hire a cab."

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But these boys and
these young girls

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:90%
have walked for days and months.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to
be in their shoes.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> With the trip to India and
the interview with the Dalai

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Lama getting closer, we wanted
to talk to someone who had

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
already met him.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So Nina and John
Murray flew to New York

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:90%
to talk with Richard Gere.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:41.816 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:42.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I'm John.

00:21:42.616 --> 00:21:43.115 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:43.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, John.

00:21:43.614 --> 00:21:44.414 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Nina.

00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Nina, how are you?

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:21:46.733 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Tony, how are you?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Tony, I know you exist, too.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The camera's actually
a human being.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I could ask
you a quick question.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, go ahead.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We're asking people what
their definition of happiness

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
is, in terms of what brings
you happiness in your life?

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Now's my moment?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, happiness, in
Buddhism, is a truism,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
which is fundamental whether
you're a Buddhist or not,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:84%
but it is that we all move
towards happiness and away from

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Always.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And however we define
happiness, that's

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.785 align:middle line:84%
what we're always
moving towards.

00:22:27.785 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And however we define suffering,
we're moving away from that.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:90%
But we can understand everyone.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Our enemies, our
friends, everyone

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.237 align:middle line:84%
by looking at their actions
from that point of view.

00:22:37.237 --> 00:22:39.695 align:middle line:84%
>> But what about when you're
unhappy and when you're faced

00:22:39.695 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
with these challenges or the
suffering that you're trying

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:90%
to escape?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the reason that I
got involved with Buddhism is,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:90%
I was so unhappy.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And I saw everyone around
me being incredibly unhappy.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, "What is this about?

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Are we stuck with this?"

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to accept that,

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
so I started looking around
for systems that would

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:90%
give alternate possibilities.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And Buddhism was the
one that touched me.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Someone like the Dalai Lama, who
you'll meet, has been tested,

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:13.832 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the life of His
Holiness is so extraordinary.

00:23:13.832 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
The testing is going
on, emotional testing,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
psychological testing, physical
testing, that is going on,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:90%
it goes on constantly.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What are these tests
that you're speaking of?

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, physical tests
like His Holiness?

00:23:25.095 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.655 align:middle line:84%
>> His Holiness had everything
taken away from him.

00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:29.405 align:middle line:84%
As a small baby, his
family was taken away

00:23:29.405 --> 00:23:30.738 align:middle line:90%
and his country was taking away.

00:23:30.738 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I know his story, but
how are you testing yourself,

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.047 align:middle line:84%
or how would we be
testing ourselves?

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know your
personal history,

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure you've had
some suffering in your life.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it's operatic, huge,
or it's small and private.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But these are
tests to all of us.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And these are deep
challenges for all of us,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that are impediments to
our hearts opening up,

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:90%
to feeling empathic.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
If you can take that one time
that you were really hungry

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason, and then
multiply that by a million,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and think about all
the starving people,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
that one time that
someone, I don't know,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:84%
a girl grabbed your hair and
pulled it and knocked you

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
down or whatever,
and then imagine

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the millions of people
who are tortured every day

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and identify with them.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And these are challenges
to the reality

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:90%
of the world we live in.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And a challenge to
what we do about it.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
transformed in this process.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.748 align:middle line:84%
As much as you want
to help other people,

00:24:32.748 --> 00:24:35.510 align:middle line:84%
this process is going
to inform your lives.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We arrived in Delhi, and the
first thing we did on the very

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
first day is, we went
out to Kingsway Camp.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is a place that was
established by Gandhi, where

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi used to stay in the very
early days of the independence

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And he created this
place for the Harijans.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
poorest of the poor.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:90%
They're the scavenger caste.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And these kids, what they had
to offer us was their prayers.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.003 align:middle line:84%
And they sang these
Sanskrit prayers.

00:26:02.003 --> 00:26:04.418 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> They were all just
so happy to see us,

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and it reminded me of
me being one of them,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.790 align:middle line:84%
standing in a
straight line waiting,

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:84%
when some other foreigner came
in, the big smile that came

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:90%
on my face.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It used to be me.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We left Delhi
for the orphanage,

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:84%
at the Sri Ram ashram, which is
Mount Madonna's sister school

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:90%
in India.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.465 align:middle line:84%
Both were founded by
students of Baba Hari

00:26:51.465 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Dass, who is a silent monk.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the kids
know him as Baba-ji.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
For Prabha, this is
where she grew up.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So this was a
homecoming for her.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Baba-ji is my dad, kind of.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:90%
He is my dad.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So when Baba-ji was a kid,
he went to an orphanage,

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and he saw that the kids
weren't treated right.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And he was very sad, so
he made a promise that he

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:90%
would open an orphanage.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was the fourth kid.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.055 align:middle line:84%
When a new kid comes, we
don't say "Oh, my god.

00:27:28.055 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:90%
There's another one."

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:84%
We just take him right in, and
that just fills up more love.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:90%
There's more help.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Like if the kid needs
help, we're there.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen family,
so this is our family.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I have no other
definition of a family.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Just being here, I can feel
the love coming my way.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We went to Har Ki
Pauri and I bet

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.480 align:middle line:84%
there were more than
2,000 people there.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And just for that 15 minutes,
that amount of people come.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And it is spiritual.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:84%
In India, every festival
is celebrated with family

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and a whole community.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.875 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, and that
brings you more close.

00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> There is just like hundreds,
just like thousands of people

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:90%
just chilling.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was just really
surprising to think

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:90%
that they do this every night.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> These people have
barely anything,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:84%
yet they are happier than most
people that have absolutely

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:90%
To me, this is true happiness.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.700 align:middle line:90%
These kids have true happiness.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Running around, playing,
being who they are,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
this is like paradise.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I hated everybody before.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I hated life.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just hated the fact
that people would smile.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I just hated laughing.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I would just sit in my
room, and I would never smile,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and I would hate people.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
want to kill them.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And just going step by
step, it took me two years

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to be the person I am today,
always smiling or laughing.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So that changed me, to know that
every person deserves to laugh,

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's OK to laugh.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think just to
forgive, that I've

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
forgiven people who hurt
me when I was a kid,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.166 align:middle line:90%
and that changed, so.

00:30:50.166 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just very happy
right now with the kids.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And the memory is going to
be me laughing with them 24

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
hours every single day
at the most stupidest

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:11.090 align:middle line:84%
jokes you can ever think of,
and we were just so stupid.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about
it now, you just laugh.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It may look messy, but
I know where everything is.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:90%
My strategy is this.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
If you unpack and
everything's around your bags,

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.738 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier than having
to dig through your bags

00:31:41.738 --> 00:31:42.988 align:middle line:90%
constantly for all your stuff.

00:31:42.988 --> 00:31:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> He's got a point.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be cool to
meet the people from the other

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:84%
places and actually have
time to hang out with them.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.868 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much Essen's
going to make us work.

go to Dharamsala,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:84%
not just for the Dalai Lama,
but that place is going to be

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The Himalayas, the
air, that's going

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:90%
to be incredibly beautiful.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:90%

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I really do need
to know how to--

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Face down.

00:32:13.293 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:90%

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is an experience
that I will only get once

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:90%
in a lifetime.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Especially to be in a
room with the Dalai Lama,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm very stoked.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:90%

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We began to see, in
real life experience,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
some of the answers
we'd been looking for.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.990 align:middle line:84%
What brings lasting
happiness shows up

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:04.180 align:middle line:84%
as gratitude, forgiveness,
helping others, and community.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:90%
The proof was all around us.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.820 align:middle line:84%
The children we met
demonstrated that you

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
can be very happy when you
tap into your inner resources.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I, Yeshi Kando, on

develop happiness and
emotional intelligence just

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:35.880 align:middle line:84%
as we're taught
algebra or writing.

little bit different process

know about America that you

don't know?

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What I like to do is look
at different religions and pick

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:90%
what I like from them.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So I like Jesus.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Like, if you read--

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.945 align:middle line:84%
do you have a world
religions class or?

00:36:55.945 --> 00:36:58.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the word "religion,"
especially in America,

00:36:58.867 --> 00:37:02.032 align:middle line:84%
it's such a powerful word
that people don't really want

00:37:02.032 --> 00:37:04.612 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it, because
everybody in America tries

00:37:04.612 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:90%
to be so politically correct.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that happiness
is naturally originated

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.600 align:middle line:90%
in one's mind.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, really, it's
the change inside ourselves

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
that's going to produce
the change in the world.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not changed
by this experience,

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.743 align:middle line:90%
nothing has happened.

00:37:26.743 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>> How many students
are at each school?

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.202 align:middle line:84%
Like, how many students
are at your school?

00:37:30.202 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> This school?

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:90%
About 1,060.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's about
7,000 students in all?

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:90%
These are the rooms.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:90%
These are the rooms over here.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:90%
These ones [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And he sleeps here.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, this is my bed.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I'm Georgey.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>> This one's my room.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:90%
My bed, not clean area.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:90%
This is dirty area.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you draw that?

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we're going to go.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you, too.

00:38:13.197 --> 00:38:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's cool.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.585 align:middle line:84%
>> We have actually
flying cows in the US.

00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:18.493 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:18.493 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they got big wings.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Fucking spiders.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Fucking spiders.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> They were so similar.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.570 align:middle line:84%
They were miles and
miles away, yet they

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.530 align:middle line:90%
were so similar to who I was.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Empathy and true
connection to others are keys

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to happiness.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And this can happen when
you least expect it.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:90%


00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You guys know freerunning?

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You run, and you do flips,
and you jump off this.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, no.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We were just so happy.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.212 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
talking about sports

00:39:01.212 --> 00:39:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and we were playing with each
other, we were almost alike.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:90%
We were like exactly alike.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:90%
We were buds.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> People do flips,
and they jump.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Very amazing.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.883 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like as if I had
traveled halfway around

00:39:14.883 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:84%
the world to hang out with my
friends that I hang out with

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.175 align:middle line:90%


00:39:20.175 --> 00:39:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You know you hear those
stories about people hiking up

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:27.230 align:middle line:84%
an insanely high hill to
meet this a yogi on the top,

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and you only get one question,
and it's all about what

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:90%
question you ask?

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:41.730 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I went into the interview
with the Dalai Lama very

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.500 align:middle line:84%
stressed out and very,
surprisingly, angry.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like he's a huge
figure that I've grown up with

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:90%
all my life.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who he was
for a really long time.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>> He's going to see me.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.460 align:middle line:84%
He's going to know that
this is Yeshi Kando,

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and she was a teacher in TCV.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And I would look
at him and think,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.740 align:middle line:84%
"I'm meeting my best friend who
does not even know I exist."

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to be told
that it's OK to be happy.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:18.253 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.253 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The minute he
stepped into that door,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.030 align:middle line:84%
the minute I saw him walk
in, for some weird reason,

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I just dropped all of it.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It was all gone.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The moment he entered,
I found myself actually

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:90%
in another planet entirely.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I just melted.

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it was, but
the presence when he walked in.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The monk enters the room, who
happens to be the Dalai Lama.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Any questions, or any
argument, or any criticism,

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:90%
most welcome.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Your Holiness, what
brings you lasting happiness?

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, we
are social animals.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Individuals, happy life,
or happy future life

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
depend on the rest
of the community.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So the element to bring, of
course, money also important,

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and gifts also.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is human warm
heartedness, human affection.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.910 align:middle line:90%
So the key element is trust.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Trust brings harmony.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Harmony brings happier society.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So not talking about
next life simply

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to be a happier
person, a more meaningful life.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I feel these are
essential things.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:56.060 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand fighting,
quarreling, killing,

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and to some extent, that's
also part of our life

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.260 align:middle line:90%
in order to protect ourself.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But basically, these are
destroyer of our happy society,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.470 align:middle line:90%
happy individual.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Fighting, anger, hatred
creates more enemy.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Love, compassion
create more friend.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves friends.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.610 align:middle line:90%
No one wants enemy.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I think each day start,
I think nobody thinking,

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, today, I want to
create enemy, one enemy."

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So know how to make
practical these ideas?

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.337 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:42:46.337 --> 00:42:48.572 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:48.572 --> 00:42:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:90%
I just express.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I didn't expect
he was going to do that.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.150 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.407 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't he know
what happiness is?

00:42:59.407 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It was one of those points
when you just realize that

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.880 align:middle line:90%
he's human.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That was his answer.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:04.860 align:middle line:90%
"I don't know."

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:09.760 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> How should we react
or respond to people who

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:84%
deliberately hurt us or
deprive us from certain rights

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and privileges because they feel
they are more powerful than us

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:90%
or they think we're helpless?

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Ah, this is a
practical question, hm?

00:43:29.568 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:38.700 align:middle line:84%
When we face someone who
are taking advantage on you,

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.890 align:middle line:84%
or bullying on you, or
discriminating on you,

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:53.790 align:middle line:84%
try to take appropriate
countermeasure through law,

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:90%
or through mobilize more people.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Or sometimes you have to shout.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.485 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.485 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think, unfortunately,
today's world

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.330 align:middle line:90%
is a lot like that.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:90%
But better nonviolent way.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Then there is greater chance
to change other's mind.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Next?

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Your Holiness, it is said
that you have to experience

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.080 align:middle line:90%
sorrow to achieve happiness.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's also true that to
achieve the ultimate happiness,

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.950 align:middle line:84%
we have to experience
the ultimate sorrow?

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:90%

00:44:54.030 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes, generally speaking, a
life spent a very easy way,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it is spoiled, basic
sort of human potential, hm?

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, many years ago,
I met one Tibetan.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I asked him what he
feel toward the Chinese.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:21.995 align:middle line:84%
Before he give answer, his
face became red, and then--

00:45:21.995 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:84%
this is what we
call "cheek red."

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.475 align:middle line:90%
Cheeks look like that.

00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
"Yes, I'm very angry."

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.960 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there were some Tibetans

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that even though they
spent many years,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I think at least two
decades, around two decades,

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.180 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese gulag, a lot of
problems, a lot of suffering,

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:53.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of torture, but
their mind, very calm.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Although both are in a
free country now in India,

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.650 align:middle line:84%
but some still
mentally not very free.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Too much anger, too much hatred.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Those more happier,
more calm-minded Tibetan

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.280 align:middle line:84%
ex-prisoners of the
Chinese, now, their mind,

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I think, the more free from
these negative emotions,

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.310 align:middle line:90%
destructive emotions.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So the result, these
people more happier.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.112 align:middle line:90%
I myself, I don't know.

00:46:28.112 --> 00:46:29.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:90%
In what category, I don't know.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:32.874 align:middle line:90%
Maybe middle.

00:46:32.874 --> 00:46:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe middle.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:36.992 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:36.992 --> 00:46:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So now important is your
spirit, your determination,

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.390 align:middle line:90%
your self-confidence.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:46.890 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.200 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.200 --> 00:47:07.040 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the moment I've
really been waiting for.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Now I have gotten the power
to go back into the society

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and do exactly what I want.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:20.135 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.135 --> 00:47:22.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, thank you.

00:47:29.684 --> 00:47:30.484 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:30.484 --> 00:47:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the end point of
our curriculum, basically.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.242 align:middle line:84%
Our question was, "what
brings you lasting happiness?"

00:47:39.242 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:90%
We've asked that to everyone.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:41.630 align:middle line:90%
We've asked it to ourselves.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.048 align:middle line:84%
We've asked it to people
who haven't answered.

00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We've asked it to people who
have answered for like two

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.257 align:middle line:90%
hours on the question.

00:47:47.257 --> 00:47:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We've asked it to people who
answer it in a split second.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the man
who we thought was

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:58.460 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us what happiness
is, and here he doesn't know.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So we understand the basic
parameters of happiness,

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with human
relationships, sacrifice,

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and service to others.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Those are all in the field
of the support of happiness.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But for each of us
personally, it's

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.320 align:middle line:90%
a moment to moment experience.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's not that
he didn't know for himself.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It's that he was
leaving it up to us.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Watching the Tibetan kids
getting blessed by His Holiness

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and just the emotion and
the look on their face,

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to be in that room was just
really touching for me,

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and to see them being blessed
was really touching, too.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> To hear about
your guys' life,

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and hear that it's
not all that--

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:84%
in some ways it's so
different, and in some ways,

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.290 align:middle line:90%
we're really the exact same.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.887 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty cool.

00:48:57.887 --> 00:48:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Meeting you guys and
seeing your culture,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I knew that from watching
you guys dance and sing,

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.870 align:middle line:84%
how much you really embrace
it, I knew I'd be jealous.

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And just seeing you
guys is so inspiring.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're not defined
by being Tibetan,

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:16.220 align:middle line:84%
but you use it in
your life, and it

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.990 align:middle line:84%
helps to form who
you are as people,

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.417 align:middle line:90%
and it's really beautiful.

00:49:19.417 --> 00:49:22.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Me and a couple other guys
were accepted into the home

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.380 align:middle line:90%
of these guys' dorms.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, being accepted
as family and friends,

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and just joking around with
us in such a small group,

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like this is
now a new home for me.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In every human being, there
is a powerful seed that is

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.790 align:middle line:90%
planted.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And each of us has
to allow that seed

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to germinate, to
grow and expand.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't really goodbye.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Happiness isn't
something you can finish.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We had to figure out what
everyone had learned,

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and put it all together
to share with others.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.870 align:middle line:84%
In a way, the project
had just started.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure that
when we get back,

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Faith is going to be different.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Mercy is going to be different.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they will
become like teachers

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.515 align:middle line:84%
for those who were
not here, because they

00:50:21.515 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:90%
have seen it themselves.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.018 align:middle line:84%
>> I will be a source
of advice to others.

00:50:26.018 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that I've
learned, all these connections,

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.800 align:middle line:84%
everything that I've built is
going to help me create who I

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.600 align:middle line:90%
am.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> All this way, and what we
found was that no one can give

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:84%
us the keys to
our own happiness.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:44.120 align:middle line:84%
We find them on our own,
and in our own time.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We each have a choice in how
we think about our lives.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.140 align:middle line:90%
We can choose to be happier.

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And those choices ripple out
and affect the world around us.

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.275 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are that powerful.

00:50:57.275 --> 00:51:19.397 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.397 --> 00:51:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember I got off the
plane and was looking around

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:25.620 align:middle line:84%
for him, because I was thinking,
maybe this once he's going

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to be one of those parents that
is just waiting there for me.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.200 align:middle line:84%
There was already a
lot of parents there,

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.552 align:middle line:84%
who had obviously been
waiting for their kids.

00:51:34.552 --> 00:51:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I was worried that
my dad even knew

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I was coming back that day.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember just
being really angry,

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
hide from everyone

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and not let them know that
he wasn't there, again.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:50.870 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of the
moms came and grabbed me

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and she like, "Nina,
your dad's here."

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.156 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK, Mama.

00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:59.566 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:51:59.566 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I just dropped
everything, and ran to him,

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and grabbed him, and just
started crying in his arms,

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:90%
because he was there.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.670 align:middle line:84%
That was just one
of the moments where

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk to my father, but
I felt that I said more to him

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:27.230 align:middle line:84%
than I've ever dared to say
to him, about how I'm feeling.

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about letting
go of the grief,

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.733 align:middle line:90%
the grief that defined me.

00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:34.150 align:middle line:84%
When everybody
asked me who I was,

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
it was that grief
that I went to,

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and then that I was moving on,
and that I wasn't feeling as

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:90%
bad and not grieving as much.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was losing myself,
and then I realized it was OK.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time I
came back to Nigeria,

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I decided to resign my
appointment with the school I

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.905 align:middle line:84%
was working, and then to start
Creative Minds International

00:52:55.905 --> 00:52:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Academy.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I am going through the
greatest moment of my life.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say it with every
strength in my heart,

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:11.430 align:middle line:84%
because this thing has
really transformed me.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I know where I'm coming from.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I know my background.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I know very well
what I'm talking about.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I felt this is an
opportunity for me

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to do something different,
where young people

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.180 align:middle line:84%
can have opportunity
to learn about values,

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:84%
so that by the time they grow
up to take leadership positions

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:34.050 align:middle line:84%
in the society, they
will shun corruption,

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.560 align:middle line:84%
they will have respect
for fellow human beings,

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and all their actions
will be guided by love

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.140 align:middle line:90%
for fellow human beings.

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to be
someone who is angry,

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.470 align:middle line:84%
but we are the
coming generation.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We should try to make
peace among each other.

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Even if the person's not
of the same tribe and maybe

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.500 align:middle line:84%
from the same country, you can
love the person for who he is.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I now know that the best way
to be happy is to put the other

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:11.640 align:middle line:84%
person first, so that when
I make that person happy,

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.380 align:middle line:90%
it comes back to me.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It comes back full circle.

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:19.420 align:middle line:84%

It's a blink of an eye.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:90%

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:55.800 align:middle line:84%
weren't as determined to
give me the opportunity

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.540 align:middle line:90%
to stay in school.

I realize that I will always
have to sacrifice for others,

but now I also
know that there are

00:55:02.373 --> 00:55:04.340 align:middle line:84%
people who are willing
to do the same for me,

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:90%

Change is daunting.

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I need to find what

Not a day went by
without me crying.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I came here, I
realized that I'm different,

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:41.020 align:middle line:90%
because I've been abused.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I was abandoned and
beaten when I was a kid.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Now I look back and think
that maybe the abuse

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.440 align:middle line:90%
was a gift within itself.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I am who I am because
of those experiences.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:53.200 align:middle line:84%

emotionally and mentally.

I want to thank Baba-ji
for doing all he could

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.430 align:middle line:90%
in his will to make me who I am.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:06.280 align:middle line:84%

want to thank you.

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if it wasn't
for you, I would

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.800 align:middle line:84%
be begging on some
street, trying to survive.

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I'm
here, able to enjoy

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.300 align:middle line:84%

opportunities in my life.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.100 align:middle line:90%

we can say "Yeah, I did my best.
