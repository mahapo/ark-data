00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm ready to truly live.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:90%

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm from Los Angeles.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I went to Rishikesh,
my first time to India.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:10%
Since I was a kid, I've
been wanting someone

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.765 align:middle line:10%
that I could call my
guru, a wise teacher.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I think we all want that.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I feel incredibly at
home in Rishikesh.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.927 align:middle line:84%
I feel deeply connected,
just at ease with meditation.

00:01:45.927 --> 00:01:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.211 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to study with
a guru, a wise Yogi.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And I found Anand.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And to my astonishment,
really, he's 27 years old

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.059 align:middle line:90%
and lives in the modern world.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.975 align:middle line:90%
He rides a motorcycle.

00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
He has an iPhone,
very well off, and has

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:90%
chosen the life of a Yogi.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I studied with Anand for three
years in India and in America.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
We had experiences where
afterwards I'd ask him,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, were you doing
something at that point?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.572 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt a huge shift
in my body and my energy.

00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the next day
I asked him, were you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:90%
saying something at that point?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.349 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, yeah,
I was saying a mantra

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and sending it to you.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, and I
saw you receive it.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:84%
He's 27 and yet has
the wisdom of who

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:90%
knows how many lifetimes.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So Anand tells me that he wants
to take this amazing journey

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
into the Himalayas, into
Ladakh, over the highest

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
road in the world, which is more
than 18,000 feet in altitude,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
steep, icy cliffs, dangerous
roads, all on motorcycles.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the hardest road
you can ride your bike on.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
This is not just
a bike adventure.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.402 align:middle line:84%
This is the highest
pass, the highest self.

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Everything in me
said, holy shit.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to ride
a bike, Himalayas, stupid.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm a crazy rider.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.811 align:middle line:84%
I've been riding bikes I
don't know for how long.

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Never wanted to ride a bike.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I think it's dangerous.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I have no desire.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, well,
OK, well I'm afraid of that.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say yes.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say yes now because
I want to go to The Himalayas.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be with Anand.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.366 align:middle line:84%
>>That shows some commitment
to transformation.

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:56.746 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Fascinating, in
India, the name

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.625 align:middle line:84%
for time, death, and
illusion is the same word.

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's called kala.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Kala is time.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Kala is death.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.366 align:middle line:90%
Kala is illusion.

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So death is just
another name for time.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is bound
by time will die.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is beyond
time, cannot die.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.135 align:middle line:84%
For you to die, for something
to totally destruct,

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.652 align:middle line:90%
it has to be bound within time.

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:23.785 align:middle line:90%
And that's kala.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>So we offered this
challenge to a group

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.020 align:middle line:84%
of people who, unlike myself,
are experienced motorcyclers,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
but who have not
studied with Anand,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
other than Eric, who
met Anand in America.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:10%
>>We just get stuck
in these little boxes

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:10%
of who we're supposed to be.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.785 align:middle line:10%
You become a husband.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:10%
And you have to be a
husband in a certain way.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And then you become a father.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And having children, you
have to become a certain way.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of times,
you lose who you are.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And now with this
trip, it's just

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
like my blossom of getting
out of my box of who everyone

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.622 align:middle line:90%
thought I was supposed to be.

00:05:03.622 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>How can we even
live separated, so

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from this?

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
How can we ever think that
happiness is possible,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:90%
joy is possible?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.267 align:middle line:84%
Cannot be, because
you're living in a lie,

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:90%
caught up in a little box.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:10%
>>My concern would be each
person's level of preparedness

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:10%
for what we're
about to experience.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Just in terms of going from
this environment, which

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:10%
can be upwards of 90 degrees,
to this environment, which

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:10%
could be 25 degrees,
and all those varying

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:10%
stages in between.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So my concern would
be are we really

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
prepared for all of
those different levels

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.766 align:middle line:90%
that we may encounter?

00:05:43.766 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.936 align:middle line:90%
>>This is like the Mt.

00:05:47.936 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Everest of biking.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the highest drivable
road a bike can reach.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So don't expect it to be easy.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't expect it to
be 10 miles an hour

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.182 align:middle line:90%
and riding 50 kilometers a day.

00:05:59.182 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do it.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You have chosen to be
on the highest pass.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>The journey starts
in Rishikesh, and then

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
on to Manali, the
gateway to the Himalayas.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
From there, it's in to a
cold no man's land, one

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of the most dangerous roads in
the world, traversing mountain

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
passes over 18,000 feet high,
exposing silence and beauty,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.305 align:middle line:90%
and all leading us to Leh.

00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:10%
From there, it's over
the highest pass,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:10%
and into the hidden
Nubra Valley,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:10%
a trip totaling
2,000 kilometers.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:10%
I've been riding for
two weeks in America.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I bought a bike, and then two
weeks in India, at the most.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.706 align:middle line:90%
Next thing, highest pass.

00:06:39.706 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.446 align:middle line:10%
>>It could be a big truck
trying to avoid a pothole.

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And he's not going
to be looking at me.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.772 align:middle line:10%
He's going to be
looking at the pothole.

00:06:55.772 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But so long as I'm
looking at that truck,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
you can swerve and avoid,
and just those sorts of day

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:84%
to day hazards, I
think I'll be fine.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:90%
And we as a team will be fine.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.545 align:middle line:84%
>>As soon as we took
off, I got inside.

00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And this truck's coming around
and taking up the whole road.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I just had enough room
between here and the dirt.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And the dirt was just a few more
feet where it was, you know,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
no man's land.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.059 align:middle line:90%
>>Is that common?

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
People getting hit
because of the truckers?

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>They almost get hit,
it's common, almost.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:90%
That's very common.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But getting hit is not so much
because you get used to it.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So you just have
to realize that you

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:90%
have to not only drive safe.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.211 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take care of
the other person's crazy driving

00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:34.956 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Because those trucks don't care.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:90%
They are road killers.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>You have to ride defensively.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Or aggressively.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Aggressive defensive.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Just go fast.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Just go.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't stop.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Or just stop.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Don't do halfway.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.154 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:57.945 align:middle line:10%
>>They're going to the
top of the Himalayas

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:10%
at 18,500 feet on a motorcycle?

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm in.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.045 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for a higher
purpose more than anything.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.522 align:middle line:84%
>>The sound just does
something to you.

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
It just makes you
clear, makes you still.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Purification occurs in stillness
because when you're still,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.584 align:middle line:84%
when the water is
still, it becomes clear.

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:10%
>>So the highest pass is-- it's

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:90%
He put his foot down.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And then my fear was
that he was going

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to go underneath the
truck completely.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I feel like-- I
feel like it's numb.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.696 align:middle line:84%
>>All right, so
keep the boot on.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
He needs to get to the hospital
before they take it off.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>All right, let's take him.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>I was kind of in shock.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe
what was going on.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.139 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even want
to look at my foot.

00:19:03.139 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what was going--
when we took my boot off,

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.735 align:middle line:84%
what was my foot
going to be like?

00:19:07.735 --> 00:19:10.522 align:middle line:90%
And was it broken in 100 pieces?

00:19:10.522 --> 00:19:11.998 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:19:11.998 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.855 align:middle line:84%
There was a big
water tanker truck.

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I could just
maneuver right around it.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:90%
But I was tired.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't thinking.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
question, like,

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.635 align:middle line:90%
oh, maybe I should just wait.

00:19:26.635 --> 00:19:39.435 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.435 --> 00:19:41.407 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes

00:19:41.407 --> 00:19:42.886 align:middle line:90%
>>No break?

00:19:42.886 --> 00:19:44.365 align:middle line:90%
>>Woo-hoo!

00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:45.844 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah!

00:19:45.844 --> 00:19:49.006 align:middle line:90%
>>Not broken.

00:19:49.006 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>It's just a really bad sprain.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm really grateful
that-- I think

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I was watched over.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:10%
>>Watching that
happen with Eric,

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:10%
the worst case scenario kept
playing itself over and over

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:10%
in my head, going, OK well, what
if I lose focus for a second?

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Or what if someone
pulls in my lane?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be paralyzed
for the rest of my life.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:20.207 align:middle line:84%
If you lose your concentration
and your focus, you will die.

00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>People are afraid.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a fear going on.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:90%
I know I have tons of it.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Today was a 14 hour ride
covering only 260 kilometers.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>It's too much to ask to not
be afraid, not afraid at all.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you can hold still,
and just breathe, and know,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and know in your heart that
you are loved And have more

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%
love in your heart than fear.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Our love can trump the fear.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:90%
The truck is coming.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
going to the gravel.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:84%
if you just have more love in
that moment, then you're OK.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:90%
You are OK, right?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But if the fear seizes you in
panic, the mind becomes dumb.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.926 align:middle line:90%
Fear makes us dumb.

00:21:05.926 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Love makes us supremely
intuitive, intelligent.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>This morning, Eric
decides not to ride.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But his accident has helped
heighten our awareness

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:84%
as we ride to the
next town, Mandi.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Thanks to Anand's first talk
about replacing fear with love,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:10%
I found myself battling that
line of fear and love again.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And fear was definitely winning.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember what I know from my
own yoga, take these superhuman

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:90%
deep breaths.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
really calm down

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.211 align:middle line:84%
my nervous system for at
least six seconds or so.

00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>The constant flying
down the road with trucks,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and cars, and people
coming at you,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:84%
is just really hard on
your mind and your body,

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because it's that fear
of death constantly,

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.901 align:middle line:84%
because a car'll come right into
you that last minute, you know,

00:22:11.901 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:90%
move.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Or you have to move.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
constant, like 110%.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it was really
important for Eric

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
to see what has
happened, and for him

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
to go through it, through
his self doubt, and the fear,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and to really come out
in one piece, you know?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.108 align:middle line:90%
And to really come out strong.

00:22:30.108 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Gotta get back
on that horse, man.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Anand put four fingers up.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I'm like four.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.742 align:middle line:84%
I saw me, and Paul,
Mike, and Anand.

00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, is
that the four that

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.220 align:middle line:90%
are making the highest pass?

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.577 align:middle line:84%
My next thought right then,
was, but what about Brooks?

00:22:53.577 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Of course he's going to make it.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.909 align:middle line:90%
And I look in my mirror.

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:57.806 align:middle line:90%
In my mirror, I see Brooks.

00:22:57.806 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>I just slowly start
to make my turn.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And I look in.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
truck just shoots right out.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere
to go on the road.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I realize, I'm
going to clip this guy.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Something just said
to me, jump left.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Jump left!

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:90%
He hit my left handle bar.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And it went down
under the truck.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>I heard the crack.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.775 align:middle line:90%
And I saw him tumble.

00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And actually like tumble
and land kind of standing.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It was like the
weirdest like pop up.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>How did you not
go under the bumper?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>If you go under
the bumper, you die.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>I saw him go down.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>As I'm sliding and tumbling,
I just see in my peripheral,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I see Eric.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>And I was right behind him.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.154 align:middle line:90%
>>Sliding by me.

00:23:36.154 --> 00:23:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, shit.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:38.595 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm fucking done.

00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Fuck this.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh my God.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.005 align:middle line:90%
>>Fuck this.

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm fucking done.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.919 align:middle line:84%
>>Honestly, after Eric
and Brooks crashed,

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:84%
there was like this feeling
of, like, this is it.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.876 align:middle line:90%
Eric's like, I'm done.

00:23:48.876 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And Brooks, one of the best
riders, get hits by a truck.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Are people going to bail?

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.875 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to be done?

00:23:56.875 --> 00:23:58.666 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, every rider
knows that whenever

00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:01.065 align:middle line:84%
they get on a bike, they're
increasing their risk.

00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't want this to be the
experience that kind of puts

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
them over.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.686 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.686 --> 00:24:11.257 align:middle line:90%
>>Are you fine?

00:24:11.257 --> 00:24:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>This is going to
be a little swollen

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.255 align:middle line:84%
and stiff tomorrow,
ow, yeah, right there.

00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Do we notice one similarity?

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
That all the three things
has happened at turns,

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:90%
at these curves.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.175 align:middle line:84%
So you guys, we need to be
really aware at how we turn.

00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:26.524 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I think, it sounds
like Brooks was aware.

00:24:26.524 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's talking
to us right now.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.921 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>As we said the first day, our
intention is we move as one.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And somebody gets hurt,
we all get hurt, right?

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
thankful as a group

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that this just becomes a part
of the adventure of the ride,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and not something that keeps
us from riding, you know?

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Seeing all these
experienced riders go down,

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.887 align:middle line:84%
I really don't want
to ride right now.

00:24:52.887 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%
But I don't have a choice.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.776 align:middle line:90%

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>I really thought the
trip, in some ways,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:90%
was falling apart today.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Eric was gone.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Where's the next airport?

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm ready.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>He was not in his body at all.

my wife, and play with my dog.

know what's coming.

>>The guy didn't even
get out of the truck.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:23.042 align:middle line:84%
Here it is in this hotbed of
spirituality, and awareness,

00:25:23.042 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and awakening.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.967 align:middle line:84%
And this guy couldn't
even look at me

00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:28.342 align:middle line:84%
to see if my head was split
open on the side of the road.

00:25:28.342 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
He just had to get
the fuck out of there.

Be positive, or freak out
and be all dramatic about it.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%

I mean, he always goes to humor.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:90%

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is really crazy.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.035 align:middle line:84%
Why are we risking
all these things?

00:26:20.035 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I really told him that he
always had the option of going.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.775 align:middle line:84%
And I would help him if
he wanted to go back.

00:26:31.775 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't have to ride
the bike if he didn't want to.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.566 align:middle line:84%
But he had to stay
on the journey.

00:26:35.566 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it was not about riding,
or proving to anybody about,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:84%
look, how powerful, or
how courageous I am.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The biggest courage is
to go beyond your mind,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond what
your mind is telling

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to you, to go
beyond the familiar.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Why am I here, really?

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not really about going
up and doing what we do.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's really about in here.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, fear,
overcoming that fear,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.205 align:middle line:84%
getting in touch with
it, getting past it,

00:27:01.205 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and if I did get
back on the bike,

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I would just be
giving in to that.

this play of fear,

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:90%
conquering fear.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.341 align:middle line:84%
And I see people
doing that every day.

00:27:12.341 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And people getting
over it is exactly what

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I would want from this
trip, pure and simple,

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%

and get over their fears.

chill behind you, OK?

my protective shoulder pads,

here talking to you right now.

it's my commitment

to make sure you
get fully geared up.

or your slam into a truck.

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:53.124 align:middle line:84%
That'll be my little wisdom that
I'll try to pass on to Anand.

avoid thinking about
these icy mountain passes.

Even Anand has never
attempted these roads.

This is the highest
pass, Khardungla.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
This road that we start
tomorrow is really

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:84%
all the highest pass,
the highest drivable

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:90%
road in the world.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't end until
we get to Khardungla.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Ladakh means the land of passes.

The most number of
passes are on this road.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So once we cross the
first pass, Rohtang,

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:90%
we are in no man's land.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:90%
We will find snow on the road.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll find mud
streams on the road.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We'll find muddy road.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll sleep at Jespa
at 10,000 feet.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we go up to
Baralachala at 16,500.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But this pass is still
closed, still not open.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.810 align:middle line:84%
They say they clear it,
and then it snows again.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:90%

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And then it snows again.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Day before yesterday,
they had six feet of snow.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.206 align:middle line:84%
We will be the first riders
who are going this season.

00:29:58.206 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
We will be the first.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%

the highest road in the world.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:90%
But there is another option.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We can go from Manali, to
Shinagar, Kargil, and then Leh.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:90%
This is open.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.255 align:middle line:90%
And it is the easier route.

00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, intellectually
it is the safer choice.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But something keeps whispering
to me to continue on our path.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%

the real choice.

It's the real truly living.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Either we go to safety,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.391 align:middle line:90%
We risk it.

00:30:36.391 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
choice that Anand's

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:84%
been making his whole life,
carrying a prophecy that he'll

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.560 align:middle line:84%
die at a certain age,
and yet still living

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:90%

it's just the most
beautiful place.

>>The rocks of jewel,
home, money, ohm.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I will let the sacred
jewel of my heart shine

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
forth, bring joy and light
to the world and to me.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the mantra of compassion.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the mantra you will
see in the prayer wheels.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
People sit here,
and they carve them.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And then they leave.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And the most beautiful thing
you'll see, they're all unique.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And none of them has a name
on it that who wrote it,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:90%
or such and such date.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:84%
See, it's really about total
annihilation of the ego.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Somebody by chance, like
us, could come upon it

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:11.195 align:middle line:84%
and feel at ease,
kind of remember,

00:36:11.195 --> 00:36:13.920 align:middle line:84%
again, what life is all
about, just by chance.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>It feels like the
spiritual journey is now

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.240 align:middle line:90%
really beginning.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:84%
No more distractions of
traffic or information.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.875 align:middle line:10%
It's just us, a tribe
amidst the mountains.

00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:31.755 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.755 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>I got a lot of noise that's
going on inside my head.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I get a lot of noise
back in Los Angeles.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've just
gotten so used to it

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
that when you start
hearing quiet, especially

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.003 align:middle line:84%
beyond the bike, and
seeing the scenery,

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.760 align:middle line:84%
it just takes me
to another place.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.734 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying really, really
hard to just take all that in.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.454 align:middle line:90%
That was an awesome ride.

00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:90%
That was the best day yet.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.595 align:middle line:90%
It was gorgeous.

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:90%
It was magical.

ridden in anything like that

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:90%
ever in my life.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>You did great.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>And it was cool just
to, like, play on a bike.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And these things know
what they're doing.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:90%
They like it.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:90%
They like the earth.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:90%
They like the mud.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.692 align:middle line:90%
And they play with us.

>>I'm glad I'm here.

00:37:43.464 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm glad you're
here too, buddy.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:49.074 align:middle line:90%
Glad you didn't hop on a plane.

things where you kind of go,

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm never going to do that.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a lot of the
never going to do thats.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And kind of the last
remaining one for me was I'm

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:90%
never going to get on a bike.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
This is like tough
stuff to learn on.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I actually was
surprised how natural

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:84%
it was, the gear clutch
thing on the left side.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The initial feeling was, not
I'm one of them, clearly not.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But it was like, I'm 10% one of
them, or maybe 5% one of them.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't so mysterious anymore.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so, this is
really foreign to me

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just this chick
hanging out on the back.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what an amazing
place to learn.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I think when you
have the opportunity

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to push through something
and you don't, it's

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
much worse to get back
on a plane and go,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.960 align:middle line:90%
you didn't freaking do it.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.340 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do it.

>>Anand can flip us right
into the highest vibration.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's something Anand
has done countless times

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.990 align:middle line:84%
through the three years
studying with him.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
He has this ability to push me
to places I wouldn't normally

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:34.920 align:middle line:84%
go, things I
wouldn't want to do.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.570 align:middle line:84%

someone else can know me better

than myself.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:90%

>>The relationship with Adam
is of deep love and respect.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:84%
He recognizes that there are
certain things he doesn't know.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's the thing.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:90%
He has trust.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:90%

I think to ride here on
this journey is really--

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
says a lot about his deep
faith in me, and respect.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.010 align:middle line:90%

for other riders.

>>Here we got a Yogi who
has got all this wisdom,

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and can teach us a lot
of things and everything.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.060 align:middle line:84%
But mechanically,
what does he know?

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe we'd be in
a little bit of trouble.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And actually I am humbled
now, because things

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:90%
started coming together.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that he
knew what he was doing.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's one person
I can honestly

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:84%
say that the qualities
he has, I would

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.130 align:middle line:84%
like to take a lot
of that and model,

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:84%
because he keeps
things so simple.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't say that

They are working there, saying
around five to six kilometers

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.060 align:middle line:84%
After this turn, it's
slightly thicker again.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.395 align:middle line:84%
But after five kilometer,
there is no snow.

00:42:24.395 --> 00:42:25.270 align:middle line:90%
This is the thickest.

up, 30 feet, 40 feet of snow.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Every pass has a temple.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.142 align:middle line:84%
But you have to request
the pass to open.

00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:40.468 align:middle line:90%
The pass is still not open.

00:42:40.468 --> 00:42:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.380 align:middle line:90%
A mountain might listen.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.526 align:middle line:84%
If he listens, he
might let us pass.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Tremendous snow will
clear from this place.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.010 align:middle line:84%

because as the day progresses,
the chances of avalanche

00:43:09.751 --> 00:43:15.640 align:middle line:84%
increase because the sun
beats down, and then--

To have a certain respect for
the road and the environment

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is very important because
of the ripple effect

I'm going to keep a clock.

00:45:13.173 --> 00:45:15.400 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to wait
more than 20 minutes.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:21.410 align:middle line:10%
10:37, if by 11 no word,
we can't stay anymore.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't want to stay
up here very long.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:84%
The sooner we can
roll, the better.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.001 align:middle line:84%
>>I didn't know how altitude
would affect everybody.

00:45:29.001 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Having been up there
for two hours the day

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.350 align:middle line:84%
before, and come down
with a throbbing headache,

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I knew two hours was too long.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Eric is already
feeling the dizziness.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:39.980 align:middle line:84%
He just slid on the
ice and went down.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So he might have
somebody ride for him.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.140 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully he gets back on.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.590 align:middle line:84%
They're just
checking on the pass.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:84%
If I don't hear in 10
minutes, then we'll

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:84%
go up because we can't
just wait for much longer.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:59.081 align:middle line:84%
>>Mike, Paul, and
Brooks, we went forward.

00:45:59.081 --> 00:46:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was the first one.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I see is
slush, just thick slush.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.276 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.276 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Where we were stuck was
an avalanche-prone area

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because there was
just 15 feet of snow.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.650 align:middle line:84%
You look up and
just mounds of snow,

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.227 align:middle line:84%
a glacier on top,
which could come down.

00:46:18.227 --> 00:46:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And sun was shining.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.550 align:middle line:90%
It could come down any moment.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:90%


00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So we made it through
the first obstacle.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.480 align:middle line:90%
There was snow all over.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:90%
And we somehow made it.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I look back,
and there is no--

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.629 align:middle line:90%
the three riders aren't there.

00:46:44.629 --> 00:46:45.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm just wondering.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Should I go back?

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, Eric's back there.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Eric stopped.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.480 align:middle line:10%
He fell, but not bad.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:10%
He's just-- someone told
everyone that it's closed.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.590 align:middle line:10%
>>I had a hard time
turning corners.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like my
coordination is just really off.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>If you want Rajik to ride,
then have him get on now.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I think I'm
going to make the call.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>So I had to make a decision.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.040 align:middle line:10%
So I decided I would
walk back to see

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.680 align:middle line:10%
maybe these guys are closer.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:10%
And I start walking back.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm in this slush to my knees.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Somehow I keep walking.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And I come to the turn.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But I see there is no
sign of the riders.

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And now I realize, I
can't walk to them.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.440 align:middle line:84%
My feet are floating in my
boot, probably an inch of water

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.690 align:middle line:90%
beneath my feet and the shoes.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.340 align:middle line:90%
So my feet are freezing.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.145 align:middle line:90%
My whole clothes were wet.

00:47:37.145 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, by that
time I saw Adam.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was a little angry.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I shouted at him, hey,
you can't wait for so long

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.480 align:middle line:84%
because I thought they were
just-- I was a little concerned

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.590 align:middle line:84%
because it was all that area
where these guys were waiting

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:53.786 align:middle line:90%
was all avalanche prone.

00:47:53.786 --> 00:47:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
get everybody out

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.320 align:middle line:90%
of there as soon as possible.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.370 align:middle line:84%
As we go down, this whole
area is blocked, just blocked.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:25.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>We're totally stopped.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:30.200 align:middle line:10%
We're pushing five hours
up there over 16,000 feet.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And these plows
suddenly run out of gas.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Because of the altitude,
everybody was slowing down.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm enjoying myself.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm Just a little
beat right now.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Once the altitude
sickness started hitting,

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.060 align:middle line:84%
once the throbbing headache
hits, then you wonder,

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, am I getting this?

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And how long are we
going to be here?

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:51.558 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to be overnight?

00:48:51.558 --> 00:48:54.092 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.092 --> 00:48:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Of course the car gets stuck.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, that's
where everything seemed

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to turn a little
bit to the negative

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.090 align:middle line:84%
because we were helping to get
this car out the best we can.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And nobody has a shovel.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has a shovel.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Some guy pulls out a bat.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.791 align:middle line:90%
>>The whole world had changed.

00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:13.790 align:middle line:90%
People were there stuck.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:14.956 align:middle line:90%
And everybody was screaming.

00:49:14.956 --> 00:49:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>And I remember just being
exhausted, just like, wow,

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.380 align:middle line:84%
the air's really thin
up here, obviously.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:22.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the energy.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.376 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting back on
the side of the road.

00:49:26.376 --> 00:49:27.833 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching all
these people work.

00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, I should help.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.080 align:middle line:10%
But it's like I
got nothing left.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.075 align:middle line:10%
>>We decide to syphon gas from
our cars to give to the plows

00:49:35.075 --> 00:49:36.856 align:middle line:10%
so they can clear our path.

00:49:36.856 --> 00:49:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.616 align:middle line:90%
>>There was no road to be seen.

00:49:50.616 --> 00:49:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was fascinating.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.660 align:middle line:90%
There was no road.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.010 align:middle line:90%
The sun was shining.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
sun, there was the fear

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.670 align:middle line:90%
of new avalanches being there.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:01.566 align:middle line:90%


00:50:01.566 --> 00:50:03.027 align:middle line:90%
>>Go, go, go.

00:50:03.027 --> 00:50:06.435 align:middle line:90%


00:50:06.435 --> 00:50:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>I was wearing the helmet.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt
I was in a movie.

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I was in a movie.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.705 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel the
connection to the mountain.

00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So my visor, I
just threw it off.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.559 align:middle line:84%
>>I keep feeling like,
cool, we made it.

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:25.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's exhilaration.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you're faced again
with another huge pile of snow.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get
through this one?

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>The water was
increasing by the minute.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh my God.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.835 align:middle line:90%
>>Whose bright idea was this?

00:50:51.835 --> 00:50:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>And since the road
hasn't opened this season,

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.700 align:middle line:84%
we don't know if the tent town
of Sarchu even exists yet.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.732 align:middle line:84%
That means we would sleep
outside in the cold.

00:51:02.732 --> 00:51:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>So you have just walls of snow
on your left and on your right.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.601 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going
through a puddle.

00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I hit another puddle,
and then another puddle.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And then what I thought was
a puddle except it was ice.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.274 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized just
how high up we were.

00:51:22.274 --> 00:51:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Just in five minutes'
time, we go down.

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
big, big avalanche.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:84%
There is no way bikes
are getting through it.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.580 align:middle line:90%
There is no passage.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:45.630 align:middle line:84%
There is a steep fall
right next to it.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:49.004 align:middle line:90%


00:51:49.004 --> 00:51:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>I puked.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I guess the altitude
sickness is real.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>When I saw Paul get
sick and start puking,

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:84%
that's when the stakes
went the highest.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.257 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm trying to get
down to 14,000 feet.

00:52:00.257 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Puking is usually, like, a
second level acute mountain

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:03.089 align:middle line:90%
sickness.

00:52:03.089 --> 00:52:05.550 align:middle line:10%
And if he's stuck
on the mountain,

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.440 align:middle line:10%
and we can't go either
way, then it's trouble.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.325 align:middle line:10%
Is Paul going to have
some serious damage?

00:52:10.325 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:10%
Because we're
going to be up here

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.090 align:middle line:10%
for three days at this altitude.

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And there's no relief.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.305 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
do to my brain?

00:52:16.305 --> 00:52:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>And this one looks
really hard to pass.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.915 align:middle line:90%
It's getting late.

00:52:19.915 --> 00:52:22.076 align:middle line:90%
The sun's about to set.

00:52:22.076 --> 00:52:23.770 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:26.040 align:middle line:84%
The vans are definitely not
getting through this one.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have no supplies
and none of that.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>My head was throbbing.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a vice grip was
just squeezing, squeezing,

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.560 align:middle line:90%
squeezing.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.535 align:middle line:84%
There was snow and
ice on the outside.

00:52:40.535 --> 00:52:42.575 align:middle line:84%
And there was fire on
the inside with everyone.

00:52:42.575 --> 00:52:44.390 align:middle line:90%
It was just raw.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Stuck, as the
feeling, that's stuck.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Why are the

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
they were concerned
about leadership.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
The mind looks for
something to blame.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, this
is the only place

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.354 align:middle line:90%
we can stay for 100 kilometers.

01:02:30.354 --> 01:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the middle of
the night at one o'clock.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm steaming hot.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
My stomach hurt,
completely sick feeling.

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
My head was pounding.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't really breathe.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And everything future
was coming up for me,

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how am I-- I
just got to get to Leh.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I just got to get to Leh.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.819 align:middle line:84%
And how am I going
to ride tomorrow?

01:02:45.819 --> 01:02:49.364 align:middle line:84%
And so I just stepped back, went
outside, looked at the stars

01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:50.280 align:middle line:90%
and started breathing.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And just got my breath back.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was a
big, big turning point

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:58.137 align:middle line:84%
of just really coming
to that breath.

01:02:58.137 --> 01:03:13.750 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.675 align:middle line:84%
>>Your physical body
will react the first.

01:03:16.675 --> 01:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And then your thoughts
start to follow.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.735 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens, it
start to, like, magnify.

01:03:21.735 --> 01:03:24.061 align:middle line:84%
Even a little thing,
starts to magnify it.

01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:25.310 align:middle line:90%
We are stuck in the mountains.

01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.226 align:middle line:90%
It starts to get dark.

01:03:26.226 --> 01:03:29.185 align:middle line:84%
And the mind can
go in that moment.

01:03:29.185 --> 01:03:30.852 align:middle line:90%
Like, where the hell are we?

01:03:30.852 --> 01:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Turn it over to your prana,
and you can balance your prana.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And the mind and the
body will follow.

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.306 align:middle line:84%
Being in nature right
now is so calming

01:03:38.306 --> 01:03:39.430 align:middle line:90%
if you're not in your mind.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.638 align:middle line:84%
It calms you down, because
there is no thought there.

01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
There is just pure
expression of prana.

01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you can connect
to our own prana,

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:49.287 align:middle line:84%
and unite it with
this, we are free.

01:03:49.287 --> 01:03:51.495 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is you
become free of circumstance.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:54.260 align:middle line:90%


01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It was just fascinating to see
everybody was feeling fine now.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody having
a headache anymore.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
There was no throwing
up, no I need oxygen.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Just a great thing even
for me as an individual

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to see the shift that
can occur in moments.

01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, it was just
amazing to see the willingness.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And since they were
willing, transformation

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:16.770 align:middle line:90%
happened just like that.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.599 align:middle line:90%
And even the water followed.

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
There was this
calmness in the water.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of us around the lake
had become more beautiful

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and the mountains
and the weather.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Satsanga it's called.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit we call it satsanga,
meaning community of truth.

recognizes that the spiritual
and meditative life is not

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:17.680 align:middle line:90%
always so peaceful.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.860 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning, it's intense.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And as Anand says, you
have to go to the fire

aligned and centered.

are you afraid of death?

Most of the people say they
are not because ego cannot

understand death.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.895 align:middle line:84%
So we are always in
denial, because even when

01:06:14.895 --> 01:06:17.586 align:middle line:84%
we think about our death,
we kind of survive it.

But when it knocks
at your door, that's

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
when fear grips
you by the throat.

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But in that knocking, there is
also this immense possibility

of liberation, of
immense freedom.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But thankfully, also,
I've had teachers

>>When fear sets in, and
you get really scared,

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that's the first
thing you think about.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.285 align:middle line:84%
Just the safety of your
family, being with your family,

01:12:54.285 --> 01:12:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and how much you miss them.

01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And that desire to just go
there into that safety net,

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and to be with them, and
just be in their love,

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
it was almost
dangerous to the mind.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
I just realized

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.250 align:middle line:90%
that it was dangerous for me.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're the most
beautiful thing in my life.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But I found that it was almost
keeping me down, that thought.

01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Instead of loving
them, and wanting

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to be with them out
of fear, now I'm

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
just wanting to be with
them out of just pure love.

>>We're coming to
this right hand turn.

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And you could see this
black like in the line

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
of the middle of our
lane and everything.

01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
But nobody knew it was oil.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:02.059 align:middle line:84%
He turned his
handlebars to the right,

01:14:02.059 --> 01:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and it just didn't stick.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And it just washed out.

01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And he went down.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.601 align:middle line:84%
And he was riding
on top of the iron.

01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:08.850 align:middle line:90%
You could tell he was shocked.

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:11.102 align:middle line:90%
It caught him off guard.

Oh my God.

Anand just went down.

>>Brooks had asked me two,
three times, saying, well,

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:21.485 align:middle line:90%
I want you safe-- to be safe.

01:14:21.485 --> 01:14:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Why won't you wear the gear?

01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:26.345 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, I was packing,
but then the gear wouldn't fit.

01:14:26.345 --> 01:14:27.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what?

01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll just wear them.

You know, Anand's all
messed up and everything.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%

think we could take care of him

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.130 align:middle line:90%

it said in the

The top is broken.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.404 align:middle line:90%
>>No way.

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>The top of your
helmet's broken.

>>When Adam came up and he saw.

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.380 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, oh, you're OK.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
You're not hurt.

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:06.424 align:middle line:84%
>>I said, yeah, the prophecy's
not about me getting hurt.

01:15:06.424 --> 01:15:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It's about me dying.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
The biggest gratitude was it
was me and not any other riders

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.592 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want that
before the highest pass.

01:15:14.592 --> 01:15:15.800 align:middle line:90%
We want all the riders there.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Had Anand not worn his helmet,
he probably would have died.

01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:27.255 align:middle line:84%
So that's bringing
death right back

01:15:27.255 --> 01:15:28.505 align:middle line:90%
to the forefront of our minds.

01:15:28.505 --> 01:15:31.770 align:middle line:90%


01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
we realize just how

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:36.600 align:middle line:84%

been this whole trip.

anything to him in that moment.

It was important for
him to go into himself

and find that strength because

I see the beautiful desire to
actually share this experience

01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and give to us.

to say goodbye to everyone.

and sharing a lot
of the philosophy

01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that he has to make
them better people.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:56.382 align:middle line:84%
Go into their lives

So through awareness, we

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is we all have a
prophecy to die that is coming.

01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So how are we going to
live with that awareness

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.430 align:middle line:84%
every movement, every
breath, every step?

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to choose
to live, to stand, to be

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
in our heart?

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.343 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

01:23:57.343 --> 01:24:00.328 align:middle line:90%
And what are we living for?

I think it's been a big
coming of age for him,

01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
to get on a bike you have never
ridden, to go and do this,

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and kind of stepping into a new
him, which is more true him.

really ask ourselves,

And not from a fear place.

What motivates me?

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
What's that inner source that's
left that pulls one through?

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.
