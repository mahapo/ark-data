00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: There will come
a time when a blue star

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:90%
would appear in the sky.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It's light will shatter
the darkness of the night.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.564 align:middle line:84%
This blue star
will bring a wind,

00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
a wine like that
which has not been

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.443 align:middle line:90%
seen on Earth in a long time.

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:90%
The blue star will bring a fire.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
This fire will be so bright
and hot that it will transform

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the matter of the universe.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.852 align:middle line:84%
The blue light from this
star is a signal that

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
shall end the fourth world.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
The blue star will
cause the oceans

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.702 align:middle line:84%
to rise and topple upon the
land, flooding the world.

00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:33.955 align:middle line:84%
All living things will perish
in this great catastrophe.

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:84%
A people with no memory of the
past are a people with amnesia.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It may be that our planet's
legends and myths are really

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of forgotten memory, a memory
so terrible that amnesia

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.908 align:middle line:90%
may have been the only cure.

00:01:50.908 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm Johana Lambert.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Earth Under Fire."

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Almost every culture
preserves myths describing

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:84%
humanity's endurance of past
events involving major loss

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:90%
of life on a global scale.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors tell us of
endless days of darkness,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
of temperatures high enough
to ignite wooded hills,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
of vast deluges covering all
but a few mountain peaks.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Today, we consider these
stories as myths, legends,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.735 align:middle line:90%
or highly imaginative tales.

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:90%
But could they be true?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
What if there really
was a gigantic disaster?

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that an
ancient advanced civilization

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
may have left a message for
us about this catastrophe?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Astrology was once considered
an advanced science.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, it is relegated to
the fringes of our reality,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
yet there appears
to be another side

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to astrology that
only now, aided

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
by the advancement of
science, are we in a position

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:90%
to fully understand.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether one
believes that planetary energy

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
shape human events, many
may be surprised to learn

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that astrology symbols
convey a highly

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated astronomical
and geological message.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
This message was
first discovered

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Paul LaViolette.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
In his most recent work,
"Earth Under Fire,"

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
he has utilized ancient
celestial and astrological

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
symbolism, as well as
astrophysics, to decipher

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
this message,
which was evidently

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
left by ancient astronomers
for future generations.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
This message concerns a
cosmological disaster, perhaps

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
the worst to ever have afflicted
the human race, a disaster

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
which, according
to Dr. LaViolette,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
was initiated by an explosion
of our galactic core.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, this ancient message
warns that this tragedy could

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
happen again, and,
indeed, that it

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
may occur at vast
periodic intervals

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
throughout the cosmic
history of the earth.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Of the hundreds of millions of
stars that make up our galaxy,

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:84%
those orbiting
closest to its center,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:84%
congregate into a
dense, spherical mass

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:90%
called the nuclear bulge.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Further out, stars orbiting
the galactic center congregate

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
into a number of gaseous
star-studded spiral arms that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
extend tens of
thousands of light years

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
outward from the center bulge
along its equatorial plane.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
From a great distance,
our galactic homeland

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
would look like an enormous
glittering pinwheel.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Our solar system is
situated about 23,000 light

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:90%
years from the galactic center.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Our sun and the earth
lie at the fringe

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.535 align:middle line:90%
of one of its spiral arms.

00:05:05.535 --> 00:05:14.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
On a clear night, the stars
forming the galaxy's spiral

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
disc may be seen stretching
across the heavens

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
as a faintly luminous band of
light known as the Milky Way.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Although the outline of
the galaxy's spiral arm

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
is visible to the naked
eye, the galactic center

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:90%
itself is hidden from view.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
The galactic center only becomes
visible during a galactic core

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:90%
outburst.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Even with the aid of
optical telescopes,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
the center of the galaxy
cannot be seen directly due

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to the dense clouds of cosmic
dust that concentrate along

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
the galaxy's equatorial plane.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though we can't see
the center of the galaxy,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.836 align:middle line:84%
apparently, the authors of the
zodiac knew of its location.

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
The signs for each of
the 12 constellations

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
have been around
since ancient times.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The glyphs for Scorpio
and Sagittarius

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones among
the zodiacal signs

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate arrows, and
both are adjacent in sequence.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:10%
When arranged to reflect the way
these constellations actually

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:10%
appear in the sky, these
two arrows or pointers

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:10%
are seen to face one another,
as if they were indicating

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:10%
some position in the sky.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they appear to
be intentionally pointing

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
out the location
of galactic center.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It may, therefore, be
far from coincidental

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
that amongst the
ancient characters

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
assigned to play specific
roles in the zodiac,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that the sign Sagittarius
is portrayed as an archer,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and he is aiming
his arrow almost

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:90%
directly at galactic center.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:84%
We also find that the
tail of the scorpion

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:90%
is very near galactic center.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, two of the stars that
make up the scorpion's tail--

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Lambda Scorpio and
Epsilon Scorpio--

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
are named Shaula and Lesath
in Arabian star charts.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Both of these mean "distinct."

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
When lines are added to
connect these three tail stars

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
with the galactic center,
Scorpio takes on the shape

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:90%
of an upward arching arrow.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Since the galactic center can at
times release lethal outbursts

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic ray particles,
such deadly symbolism

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.165 align:middle line:90%
is quite appropriate.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
However, the archer
in Sagittarius

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
is not pointing
his arrow directly

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
at the center of our galaxy.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
If we lead a trajectory
in the direction

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that Sagittarius is
presently aiming his arrow,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
we find that it misses
the galactic center

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
by 2.5 degrees of longitude.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Using a computer-aided
star map, we

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
can see that there
was a time when

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius aimed
his arrow much closer

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
to the center of our galaxy.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the
position of these stars

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
as they were an
earlier times, we

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
find that Sagittarius
was aiming directly

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of the
scorpion about 16,000

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
years ago, or about 14,000 BC.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
Such a precise indication of
the galactic center's location

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:90%
is quite astounding.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It isn't what we would usually
attribute to the abilities

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:90%
of so-called Stone Age man.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
As we noted earlier, the
galactic center's position

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
is heavily obscured
by interstellar dust,

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, is
not directly visible

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
with optical telescopes.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Harlow Shapley, working with
the 60-inch telescope at Mount

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:10%
Wilson above Los
Angeles in 1917,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:10%
determined the near
position of the location

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:10%
of the center of the galaxy.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
He was off the mark
by 3.3 degrees of arc.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
However, the ancient
Sagittarius constellation

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
indicates the galactic center
location within accuracy

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
eight times better than
Shapley's estimate.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.425 align:middle line:84%
The zodiac's message indicates
that on this trajectory date

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
a galactic center energy
creation event became visible

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and began to have a
catastrophic effect

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:90%
on our planet, the Earth.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Scientists found that the
core of an active galaxy

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
can shine brighter
than the galaxy itself.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
That is, cosmic ray
electrons streaking away

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic core
close to the speed of light

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
produce a bluish
white light so bright

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
that it masks the light from
the galaxy's spiral arms

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and surrounding mass of stars.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
When in an active
phase such as this,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
spiral galaxies are
a called Seyfert

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
galaxies, named after their
discoverer, Carl Seyfert.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Astronomical surveys show
that about one spiral galaxy

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
out of every five
to seven presently

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.336 align:middle line:84%
exhibits Seyfert-like
characteristics.

00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
On photographic plates, however,
the intensity of the outbursts

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
can be sufficiently subdued so
that the galaxy's spiral arms

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
can be distinguished,
affirming that those

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
luminous outbursts
are, indeed, spiral

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.085 align:middle line:90%
galaxies in an active phase.

00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers have come to realize
that galactic core explosions

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
occur in all spiral
galaxies, even our own,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and although the
majority of galaxies

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
have a normal appearance with
no sign of major core activity,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
they are simply galaxies
whose cores happen

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:90%
to be in their quiescent phase.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
The statistics
suggest that a galaxy

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
core resides in the quiescent
phase about 80% to 85%

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
It spends the other 15% to 20%
of its time in an active state

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.325 align:middle line:84%
with eruptive episodes
lasting from hundreds

00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:90%
to several thousands of years.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
There is abundant evidence
that the core of our galaxy

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
has undergone a major explosion
episode comparable to those

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
we observe taking place
in Seyfert galaxies

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Paul LaViolette's research
demonstrates that the zodiac

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
or cryptogram may have
been devised as an attempt

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to communicate to
future generations

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of this
pervasive galactical cycle.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
In light of Dr.
LaViolette's work,

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
we're able to ask ourselves some
astounding questions, such as,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
were the ancients who
intuited the symbolic content

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of celestial and
zodiacal patents

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.395 align:middle line:90%
attempting to tell us something?

00:12:25.395 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Many believe that
ancient peoples were ignorant

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
of the past and of the truth,
but what if their myths are

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
a warning to the
people of the future

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:84%
about an event, a
great catastrophe

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:90%
that occurred a long time ago?

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
What if the memory of this
event shaped the lives

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts of all
those who came after it?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
What if this memory is the real
significance behind humanity's

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:90%
many mythologies?

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.032 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi people of North
America have a legend

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
that there were
three other worlds

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:90%
before this, the present world.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Each of these worlds
was terminated

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
by a great catastrophe.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi believe
that this ending

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
will be heralded by the
appearance of Saquasohuh,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.265 align:middle line:90%
the blue star spirit.

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Saquasohuh will shine
brighter than all

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:90%
of the stars in the heavens.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
These legends promise that one
day the present world will also

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
come to an end, and although the
blue star spirit brings forth

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
the end of this
world, she also plants

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.859 align:middle line:90%
the seeds for the next one.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Since the cause of
distant exploding galaxies

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
are observed to have a
bright blue white star-like

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
appearance, it is
reasonable to expect

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that the core of our own galaxy
would have a similar appearance

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:90%
during its explosive stage.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The legendary appearance
of a blue star

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
could be referring to an
explosion of our galaxy's core.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Since we cannot see the galactic
core because of intervening

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:84%
dust clouds, most of the blue
light that ancient viewers

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:84%
would have seen from a
galactic core explosion

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
would have come from
the cosmic ray electrons

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:90%
emitted from the core.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
During that 23,000 light
year journey to us,

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
this advancing army
of torchbearers

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
would have been continuously
generating and beaming

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:90%
forward a bluish light.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It would have appeared
suddenly without warning

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.155 align:middle line:84%
and would have remained in
the sky for several hundred

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to several thousand years.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.420 align:middle line:84%
During this ancient
galactic superwave passage,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the star-studded sky that
we are used to seeing

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
would have been transformed
into a ghostly scene

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of various shaped, amorphous
nebulae and dust clouds

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:90%
overlying one another.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
The entire Scorpio-Sagittarius
region would have

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:90%
taken on an ominous appearance.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Within minutes of the
appearance of the blue star,

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
superwave cosmic
rays would have begun

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
impacting the solar system's
magnetic field sheath.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
This would have caused a network
to form of faintly luminous

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
cobweb-like filaments
stretching outward from the sky

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
from the vicinity
of the blue star.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the most
frightening phenomenon

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
to occur in this early stage
would be the prompt arrival

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.224 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
pulse and perhaps

00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:40.382 align:middle line:84%
shortly afterward, the
onslaught of a giant gravity

00:15:40.382 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
wave with its ensuing
crustal torque,

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.775 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes, and
volcanic eruptions.

00:15:45.775 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Legends from various
cultures around the world

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
describe the occurrence of
terrible natural distress

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:90%
affecting the entire globe.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
The Popol Vuh of the Mayan
Indians, the [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
or the sacred Zoroastrian texts,
the [INAUDIBLE] from China,

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
the sacred Buddhist
text, the Visuddhimagga,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the Bhagavata Purana text from
India, the myth of Phaeton

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and the sun chariot
from Greece all

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:90%
speak of a similar catastrophe.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
While each of these is
unique in its own way,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
they all share
certain common themes.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:84%
One such theme concerns
a period of darkness that

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
lasts for many generations and
during which the sun, moon,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and stars become dim
or even disappear

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
from view behind dark
clouds in the heavens.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Astronomical
observations indicate

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that our solar system is
surrounded by a cloud of dust

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and frozen cometary debris.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the solar wind
keeps the solar system

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.530 align:middle line:90%
free of much of this dust.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:84%
This outward breeze or wind
of ionized hydrogen and helium

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
continually emitted by the sun
exerts a pressure on these dust

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:90%
particles, keeping them at bay.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
However, upon its arrival, a
superwave cosmic ray volley

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
would have countered the
solar winds' expelling action

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and would have begun to
push this cosmic dust back

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:90%
into the solar system.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Sufficiently large amounts of
this dust in the solar system

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
could have reduced or
entirely blocked light

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
coming from the sun,
moon, and the stars,

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:84%
accounting for the
legendary references

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.845 align:middle line:90%
to the darkening of the sky.

00:17:44.845 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
In several places,
the Old Testament

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:84%
refers to a rapidly approaching
attack which brings darkness.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The Earth
shall quake before them.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:90%
The heavens shall tremble.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The sun and the
moon shall be dark,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and the stars shall
withdraw their shining.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.764 align:middle line:84%
The sun shall be turned
to darkness and the moon

00:18:12.764 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
to blood before the great and
terrible day of the Lord come.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the Old Testament's
portrayal of the Lord

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
as an angry father who inflicts
cosmic catastrophe on mankind

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to punish his sins originated
during the last ice age

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
when humanity
endured what may have

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
been the worst global disaster
of its entire history.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Several hundred years
after the first appearance

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.370 align:middle line:84%
of the blue star,
Earth observers

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:84%
would have become aware of
lighting effects resulting

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
from the superwave's
passage through the galaxy's

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:90%
central bulge.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic radiation called
synchrotron radiation emitted

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
by the superwave's cosmic
rays would have illuminated

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the dense gas clouds
in the galaxy's

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:84%
nucleus to create
an oval luminous

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:90%
form around the blue star.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
This apparition would
have been shaped somewhat

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
like this infrared map image.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Usually, dense clouds of
dust obscure the light

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:90%
coming from this region.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
However, during its
bright active phase,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:90%
sunlight would have penetrated.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This frightening spectacle
may have appeared

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
to ancient inhabitants as
the gigantic punishing eye

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Its iris would have
a brilliant light

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:84%
emanating from its central
point, the blue star.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
A superwave event accompanied
by an illumination of this sort

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:84%
may have spawned ancient
myths about mankind being

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:90%
punished by a great cosmic eye.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
One ancient Egyptian myth
tells how Atum Re, the creator,

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
sent his eye to
inflict punishment

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:90%
upon an earlier race of man.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:84%
In one version of the
myth, the god Atum

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
gathers together
the gods of creation

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:90%
to his heavenly central palace.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:90%
The god Nun addresses Atum Re.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Let your eye
be set out to seize those

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:90%
who are plotting against you.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Of itself, the eye is not
strong enough to destroy them.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Let it descend upon
them as Hathor.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT:
According to this myth,

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
the destruction of
mankind was carried

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
out by Hathor, the cowheaded
goddess of flooding waters.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Hathor's departure from Atum's
heavenly palace on her mission

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to slay mankind would represent
the superwave's ominous journey

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.711 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic center to
wreak havoc upon the Earth.

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But is there any
scientific proof that such

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
a disaster has occurred?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Paul LaViolette
first pondered the idea

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of a galactic superwave in
1979 while studying at Portland

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:84%
State University, and he
became determined to find

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:90%
an answer to the question.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
After discovering and
decoding a hidden cipher

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
in zodiacal symbology, he began
developing a complete theory

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
concerning the
outbursts which occur

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the Milky Way.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr. LaViolette knew that if a
galactic superwave had begun

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to arrive some
15,860 years ago, it

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
should have pushed cosmic
dust into the solar system.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Wondering if there
was a good way

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to check the geological
record to see if increased

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
amounts of cosmic dust had
entered the Earth's atmosphere

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:84%
during the last ice age, he
realized that the best place

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to look for such evidence would
be in the earth's polar ice

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:90%
record.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:10%
Very early on, I realized that
if a cosmic ray volley had come

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:10%
from the direction of
the galactic center,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:10%
it would have had sufficient
pressure to push forward

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:10%
interstellar dust particles,
and if sufficient amounts

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:10%
of this dust were
around the solar system,

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:10%
it would've been
carried inward and would

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:10%
enter the Earth's environment.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It would've been coming
through the Earth's atmosphere

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and falling along with
snows at that time

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and become imprisoned
in the ice caps.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And today, we should
find that dust,

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
if it was falling at that time,
in ice hundreds of meters down.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT: Dr. LaViolette
analyzed eight Greenland ice

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
core samples that
ranged from 35,000

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
to 73,000 years old and dated
from the first half of the ice

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
PAUL LAVIOLETTE: To
check for this dust,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
the best way is to look
for elements like iridium

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and nickel, which are more
abundant in extraterrestrial

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
material, and the
technique used for this is

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:90%
a neutron activation analysis.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Iridium, particularly,
is a good element,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's thousands
of times more

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
abundant in
extraterrestrial material

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:90%
than in earth material.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like gold or platinum--
very rare on Earth,

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
but you find large amounts
in extraterrestrial material,

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
so this was a particularly
good indicator.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Also, ice is a
particularly good place

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
to look for the cosmic dust,
because you get less influx

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
of dust from terrestrial
sources like wind-blown dust,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
so you'd expect cosmic dust
to be a higher percentage.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Plus, ice is such that
your deposits of this dust

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.880 align:middle line:90%
are frozen.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They're not perturbed
by geologic processes

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
as much as you'd find, for
example, in ocean sediments.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT: Todd Hinkley
is a geologist with the US

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Geological Survey in Colorado.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Hinkley has examined
the work of LaViolette,

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.520 align:middle line:84%
especially his work that
involved ice core drillings.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:10%
I think it's very
appropriate that Paul

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:10%
should look to ice cores.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:10%
The polar ice sheets that still
cover large areas at the ends

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:10%
of our planet do represent a
valuable repository of what

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:10%
has fallen onto them out of
the atmosphere for a very

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:10%
long time-- in some cases, up to
several hundred thousand years.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the ice
sheet in Greenland,

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the layers are discernible
of the preservation that

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:90%
represent individual years.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
As we go deeper or
farther back in time,

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
these are compressed
and thinner,

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
but still, we can tell
exactly where we are in time,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
because these polar ice
sheets every year save

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and preserve a layer
of ice that can

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:90%
be reliably located and dated.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I found that six out of the
eight ice age samples I tested

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
contained much higher
levels of iridium and nickel

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:90%
than current ice and snow.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So I concluded that cosmic dust
must have been entering Earth's

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere at a much faster
rate and accumulating

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.567 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth's surface much
faster then than it does today.

00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT: Most
of the interstellar

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:84%
dust from this ancient
event has disappeared

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:90%
from the solar system.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, only faint traces of it
can be seen orbiting the sun.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Most of it is concentrated
toward the ecliptic plane,

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and astronomers call
this the zodiacal cloud.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers have
presumed that much

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
of the dust in this portion
of the zodiacal dust cloud

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
has originated from
comets and asteroids.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
However, they find that such
sources cannot supply dust fast

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
enough to account
for all of the dust

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:90%
amassed in the zodiacal cloud.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:84%
PAUL LAVIOLETTE: Data received
in 1992 from the Ulysses

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft provided
further confirmation

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
that the dust in
the zodiacal belt

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
was actually of
interstellar origin.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Particle counters on
board the spacecraft

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.880 align:middle line:84%
began picking up micrometeorites
coming from the direction

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:90%
of the galactic center.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words, dust entering
from outside the solar system.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:84%
This greatly surprised
the Ulysses science team,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because up until then, they
expected that most of this dust

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
should be from
asteroids and comets

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
circulating within
the solar system.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So this provided further
confirmation for a prediction

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:90%
I had made back in the '80s.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just as Dr.
LaViolette had predicted,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:84%
they found that
this material was

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
entering the solar
system from the direction

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:90%
of galactic center.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, the notion that
interstellar cosmic dust may

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
have entered our solar
system in large amounts

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and affected the earth's climate
in relatively recent times

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:90%
has now become quite plausible.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Inspired by Dr. LaViolette's
ice age cosmic dust discoveries,

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.490 align:middle line:84%
researchers at
other universities

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:84%
have begun to carry out
their own polarized studies

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to assess the iridium and
nickel content of ancient ice.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Another piece of
evidence suggesting

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that the solar system has
experienced a recent superwave

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
event comes from the
observations of the rings

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:90%
around the outer planets.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:84%
From telescope
observations, astronomers

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.350 align:middle line:84%
have long known that
Saturn was surrounded

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:90%
by six concentric rings.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
These were presumed to consist
of relatively homogeneous

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:90%
distributions of rock and ice.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
However, closeup pictures taken
by Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
revealed that each
of these rings

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
consists of hundreds
of thousands

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.755 align:middle line:84%
of fine ringlets resembling the
grooves of a phonograph record.

00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
This discovery was perplexing,
because it was thought

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that Saturn's rings are
millions of years old

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and that any irregularities
should have by now become

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:90%
smoothed out and homogenized.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
In trying to explain
why they found

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
these intricate
patternings, scientists

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
overlooked the most
obvious, which was simply

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that the rings are
young and haven't

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%
had a chance to smooth out.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
As we have mentioned, numerous
cultures around the world

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:84%
preserve legends of
a vast conflagration

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:90%
that swept the planet long ago.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
These various tales
of a catastrophe

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
may be seen to have a reasonable
scientific explanation

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:84%
when understood in
the context of the

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:90%
galactic superwave phenomena.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.920 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: There
will be no warning

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
when this, the
fourth world, will

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:90%
be shattered by the great fire.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The myths say that
the fourth world

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:84%
will be destroyed in
order for the next world,

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:90%
the fifth world, to begin.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
These are the
prophecies that have

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
been handed down from generation
to generation among the Hopi.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They are considered
the most important

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:90%
prophecies of these people.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi prophecies say that
with the coming of Saquasohuh,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.885 align:middle line:84%
the fourth world
will come to an end.

00:29:39.885 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
PAUL LAVIOLETTE: It is
well known in astronomy

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that cosmic dust and gas falling
on to the surface of a star

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.025 align:middle line:84%
will convert its acquired
kinetic energy into heat

00:29:56.025 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of impact.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
In a similar fashion, large
quantities of cosmic dust

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and gas injected
into the solar system

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:84%
during a superwave passage
and subsequently drawn

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:84%
onto the surface
of the sun would

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:90%
have caused the sun to warm up.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic dust cocoons
surrounding the sun

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.150 align:middle line:84%
would also have contributed to
increasing the sun's surface

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
temperature by intercepting
a portion of the sun's

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:middle line:84%
outgoing energy flux
and reflecting it

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:90%
back on to the sun's surface.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Both of these effects
together would have caused

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.300 align:middle line:84%
the sun's solar flare intensity
to increase up to 1,000-fold

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:90%
during a superwave event.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic dust and gas that was
pushed into the solar system

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
by a passing superwave
would have caused the sun

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to behave as a T Tauri star.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
T Tauri stars are stars that
are observed to be surrounded

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
by a thick cloud of
interstellar gas and dust

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:84%
that causes them to
become highly luminous,

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to engage in continual
coronal flare activity,

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.805 align:middle line:84%
and to become strong
emitters of cosmic rays.

00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the sun,
whereas solar flares today

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:84%
recur anywhere from one
to 10 times per year,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
during a superwave event,
they would have been occurring

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.476 align:middle line:84%
so frequently that
they would have

00:31:06.476 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
been almost continuously present
over the surface of the sun.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
During this time, the sun's
luminosity would have increased

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:90%
up to several percent.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The interstellar dust choking
the solar system, together

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
with this increased
luminosity, would've

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:84%
produced a major warming
of the earth's climate.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Tropical regions would
have become unbearably hot,

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
whereas high latitude
regions would have

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.080 align:middle line:84%
been plagued by floods issuing
from the rapidly melting ice

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.951 align:middle line:90%
sheets.

00:31:33.951 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT: In
the legends which

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:84%
speak of a vast
conflagration, the Ipurinas,

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:84%
a tribe of northwestern Brazil,
relate that long ago, the earth

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:90%
was overwhelmed by a hot flood.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.845 align:middle line:84%
This occurred when the sun,
personified as a cauldron

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:90%
of boiling water, tipped over.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The Australian Aborigines have
a similar myth about an old man

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.910 align:middle line:84%
who opened the door of the sun
and caused a stream of fire

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:90%
to pour down upon mankind.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.180 align:middle line:84%
The Eskimos claim that the
waters of the Arctic Ocean

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:84%
became so hot that they
finally evaporated.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.860 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Druids, the great god

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.290 align:middle line:84%
punished mankind for
his universal wickedness

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:84%
by sending a virulent
poison on the earth

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:90%
by means of a violent wind.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
John Major Jenkins
is a researcher

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and scholar on the history of
the Mayan Indians of Mexico.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
He has successfully proven in
his book, "Maya Cosmogenesis

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
2012," that they were aware
of the center of the galaxy

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and of its importance
in Earth's history.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:10%
I looked into the Maya
mythology, the Popol Vuh,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:10%
the Hero Twin myth, and
I was able to identify

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:10%
certain astronomical
features that

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:10%
seemed to be important to the
ancient Maya, one of which

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:10%
is the Maya sacred tree.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And following some clues by
Maya scholars in decoding

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
the Maya writing,
the Maya sacred tree

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is the crossing point formed by
the Milky Way and the ecliptic.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Now this was very
interesting to me,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because looking
at star charts, I

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
noticed that this crossing point
in Sagittarius-Scorpio region

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is exactly where the
galactic center is located.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So I started to think
that the galactic center

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:84%
might be something that
the Maya were aware of.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:84%
One question that,
of course, came up

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:84%
is, how could the Maya be
aware of the galactic center?

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we tend to assume
that this is something that

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:84%
was discovered fairly recently
by science with radio astronomy

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But when we imagine
looking at the Milky Way

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.760 align:middle line:84%
arching across the sky, our
Milky Way is saucer-shaped,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, there's a
very bright and wide area

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Milky Way in the
region of Sagittarius.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I concluded by
looking at the Milky Way

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:84%
with just the naked
eye alone, one

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:84%
could pretty easily determine
that this was an important part

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:20.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, given that the Maya
mythologized the Milky Way

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
as the great cosmic
mother, it would

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
seem a pretty
straightforward step

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:84%
to take that to the next level
and see that they were looking

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.920 align:middle line:84%
at the galactic
center as the womb

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
or the creation
place of the sky,

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's pretty
much what it looks like.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:90%
It's very bright and very wide.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.245 align:middle line:90%
It's called the nuclear bulge.

00:34:42.245 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Astrophysicists recognize that
this is the area of the Milky

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Way out of which
everything in our galaxy,

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:90%
including us, has come.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Moon rocks harbor
considerable evidence

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:84%
indicating that the
sun was particularly

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:90%
active during the last ice age.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:90%
The moon has no atmosphere.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:84%
As a result, cosmic
micrometeorites--

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:84%
these are dust particles that
are traveling very rapidly--

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
along with solar
flare cosmic rays

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
are able to reach the
moon's surface unimpeded

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and etch permanent
records of their arrival

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:90%
in the lunar rocks.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.950 align:middle line:84%
A number of these rocks
were collected on the Apollo

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:84%
missions and brought back
for storage at the Johnson

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Space Center Repository.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Careful microscope
studies of the rocks

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:84%
revealed that their
surfaces were literally

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:84%
covered with tiny
micrometeorite craters whose

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
glassy surfaces were finely
etched with solar flare

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.990 align:middle line:90%
particle tracks.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
By studying these craters
in their cosmic ray tracks,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.470 align:middle line:84%
NASA scientist Herbert
Zook and his colleagues

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:84%
were able to construct a record
of solar activity dating back

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.670 align:middle line:90%
over the past 16,000 years.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly, what they
found was in the earliest

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
part of this record,
the solar flare tracks

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.390 align:middle line:84%
were accumulating 50 times
faster than they are today.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.200 align:middle line:84%
This dropped about five-fold
by 11,000 years ago,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the time the ice
age came to a close.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT: NASA scientist
physicist Herbert Zook and two

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of his colleagues
were able to construct

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:20.020 align:middle line:84%
a record of solar flare
activity dating back

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:90%
over the past 16,000 years.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
What they found adds
further credence

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.507 align:middle line:90%
to LaViolette's theories.

00:36:28.507 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:10%
HERBERT ZOOK: One
of the first things

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:10%
that scientists did when
they got to the moon

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:10%
was look for evidence of solar
activity changes in the past.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they measured
radioactive nuclei.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:84%
They were created in lunar
rocks from the solar protons,

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:84%
high energy protons, and solar
cosmic rays, solar flares,

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and eruptive prominences.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were
rather disappointed

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:84%
to find that from
the aluminum 26

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and manganese 53 long
half life data averaging

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
over a million years
that the activity looked

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.570 align:middle line:90%
about like it does at present.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.606 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem like
solar cosmic ray activity

00:37:05.606 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:90%
was changing very much.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But there was some carbon-14
data that indicated,

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.780 align:middle line:90%
yeah carbon-14 is kind of high.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It has a short history of
several thousand years.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It looks like over the last
10,000 to 20,000 years,

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:84%
maybe something did
happen that was increased.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.830 align:middle line:84%
The solar cosmic rays, the heavy
ions in the solar cosmic rays,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:84%
also create damage
tracks in lunar rocks.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.210 align:middle line:90%
These accumulate with time.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So the longer rock has been
exposed on the surface,

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:84%
the more damage tracks it
has, and we can actually

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:84%
etch these measure,
the density of them,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.860 align:middle line:84%
tell how long that
rock has been there,

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
but you need
another chronometer.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You need something else
to measure time with,

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and so what I did was use
meteorite impact craters

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:90%
as a measurement of time.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.195 align:middle line:84%
I also looked personally
at spacecraft windows that

00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:84%
were returned from space and
counted the impact of craters

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.970 align:middle line:90%
on there.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And you had various
kinds of divots

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
on these windows that were
caused by polishing or stuff

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
like that, but
meteorite impact craters

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.240 align:middle line:84%
had these nice melt line
pits from the hypervelocity

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of impact that actually
remelted the glass.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I got a cratering
rate from that,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and the neat thing
about the window glass

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.120 align:middle line:84%
from the spacecraft is
that those pits look very

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.730 align:middle line:84%
much like pits on mineral
rocks, so the comparison

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.210 align:middle line:90%
could be done very easily.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
My conclusion is that
there's rather good evidence

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that the sun was more active,
possibly much more active,

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:90%
10,000 to 20,000 years ago.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the increased
solar radiation flux

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:42.140 align:middle line:84%
associated with this elevated
solar cosmic ray activity

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:84%
would have been
sufficient to cause

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:90%
the melting of the ice sheets.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.390 align:middle line:84%
In graphing their
solar flare intensity,

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the NASA researchers
made the assumption

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that micrometeorite cratering
on the moon's surface

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:84%
has remained constant for
the past 16,000 years.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:84%
However, if cosmic dust was
coming into the solar system

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in large amounts at
the end of the ice age,

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:84%
this would have caused this
peak of solar cosmic reactivity

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to move to a more recent
date and increase in height.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.686 align:middle line:84%
Most likely, it would've
peaked between 14,000

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
to 15,000 years ago, which
coincides with a time when

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:84%
the earth's climate
globally was unusually warm,

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and the ice sheets were
receding at the all time high.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, a prolonged period of
cosmic dust and gas inflow

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.765 align:middle line:84%
would have explained the
sun's increased luminosity

00:39:33.765 --> 00:39:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and flaring, and we could
imagine that as this dust was

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.100 align:middle line:84%
coming in, the sun's
activity was continually

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:84%
building up as this dust
was falling at the sun,

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:90%
energizing the sun.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.770 align:middle line:84%
The corona was becoming
more and more active,

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and these coronal mass ejections
were happening now continuously

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and throwing off
the balls of plasma

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.745 align:middle line:90%
far larger than we see today.

00:39:59.745 --> 00:40:03.430 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of days, as it raced
towards the Earth and moon,

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.230 align:middle line:84%
this bubble of hot
coronal gas and plasma

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:84%
would have expanded to
form a dome-shaped front

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.315 align:middle line:84%
tens of millions of
miles in diameter.

00:40:11.315 --> 00:40:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Upon arriving, this
sphere of hot fiery plasma

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:84%
would've temporarily engulfed
the Earth and moon, producing

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.830 align:middle line:84%
temperatures hot enough
to melt dust particles

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:90%
on the surfaces of lunar rocks.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It also would have
severely disturbed

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
the earth's geomagnetic fields.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, paleomagnetic
studies have

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.820 align:middle line:84%
shown that at about that
time 14,200 years ago,

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's magnetic
pole flipped

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to an equatorial location,
and throughout this period,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field was
severely disturbed.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:84%
This would've been caused
by the solar flare particles

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:84%
getting trapped in
the radiation belts

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and producing a magnetic field
opposed to the Earth's field.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.780 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT:
Like the moon, Earth

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:84%
also preserves a record of
rapid heating of its surface.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
records are the myths

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that are held by people from
all cultures on the planet.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The time from 1.8 million
years ago up to about 9,600

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.890 align:middle line:84%
BC when the last ice age ended
is referred to by geologists

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:90%
as the Pleistocene Period.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
A study of the fossil record
reveals that at no time

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:84%
during the entire Pleistocene
did animal extinction

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
proceed at a more rapid
pace than at the close

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:90%
of the last ice age.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:40.080 align:middle line:10%
Between 13,000 and 16,000 years
ago, at least 57 land mammals

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.214 align:middle line:10%
became extinct.

00:41:42.214 --> 00:41:43.980 align:middle line:10%
PAUL LAVIOLETTE: The anomalous
nature of this episode

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.210 align:middle line:10%
is apparent in this graph, which
plots the rate of disappearance

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.320 align:middle line:10%
of large land mammals from
North America over the past two

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:10%
million years.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.700 align:middle line:10%
The rate of disappearance
for small mammals,

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:10%
although not quite as large,
was still quite significant.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.890 align:middle line:84%
If this graph can be taken
as an indicator of the loss

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:84%
of human life, we can imagine
the suffering the human race is

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.810 align:middle line:84%
going through at that time
not just over a few years,

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:90%
but over many generations.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
This unrivaled extinction
episode occurred at a time

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:84%
when the ice sheets were
discharging melt water

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.680 align:middle line:90%
at an unusually high rate.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Climate profiles show that
the Earth's climate was

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:90%
unusually warm at this time.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Both occurred at a time when the
sun was putting out cosmic rays

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:90%
at an unusual high rate.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.060 align:middle line:84%
These correlations suggest that
the mass extinction at the end

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleistocene was due to
a natural hazard associated

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:84%
with a solar conflagration
and accompanying

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.250 align:middle line:90%
glacial melt water floods.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you study
the fossil remains,

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.380 align:middle line:84%
you find that the rise
of extinction rate

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.680 align:middle line:84%
paralleled the rise
of melt water output

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.070 align:middle line:84%
from the North
American ice sheet.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, paleontologists
failed to find

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:58.850 align:middle line:84%
any extinct species surviving
past about 13,000 years ago.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
North America had the
largest glacial ice sheet,

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and studies have shown
that the cataclysm

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:90%
was most severe there.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Some 95% of the
mammals became extinct.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So what caused this
mass extinction?

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The evidence from
geology and mythology

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:84%
lead us to believe
that the extreme heat

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:21.230 align:middle line:84%
of a solar
conflagration combined

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.670 align:middle line:84%
with floods of
unprecedented proportions

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:90%
were the principal cause.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.935 align:middle line:84%
These high velocity
waves would not only

00:43:27.935 --> 00:43:30.770 align:middle line:84%
have drowned the mammals,
but would've destroyed

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:90%
their food supply as well.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Larger animals would have been
at a distinct disadvantage,

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.460 align:middle line:84%
since they would have
required greater amounts

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:90%
of biomass for their survival.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And since they take longer
for their population

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to increase in size,
the fuel-grazing mammals

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that survived this cataclysm
would've either starved

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to death or become rapidly
exterminated by their predators

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:90%
or by humans searching for food.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.020 align:middle line:84%
As we can see today, ponds and
lakes on a glacier surface,

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.760 align:middle line:84%
as well as caverns
within the glacier,

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.650 align:middle line:84%
store large quantities
of melt water.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:84%
From time to time, these can
suddenly release their contents

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and produce
potentially destructive

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:90%
floods called glacier bursts.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Both large and small animal
remains have been found

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:90%
in these permafrost silts.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Examples of large animals
would be saber-toothed

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:84%
tiger, ground sloth, mammoth,
small animals like beaver,

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.250 align:middle line:90%
squirrel.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It's generally agreed that
these animals died of asphyxia

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.770 align:middle line:90%
as would occur in drowning.

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It appears that
the same agent that

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.470 align:middle line:84%
created the Alaskan
deposits also

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.855 align:middle line:84%
operated all across
northern Siberia

00:44:48.855 --> 00:44:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to form what's called
the Mammoth Horizon.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Here they found
thousands of mammoths

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and rhinoceros preserved
in these permafrost silts.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It seems that whatever
killed these animals

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:90%
caught them unaware.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people have suggested
it was ice, that they broke

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.900 align:middle line:84%
through the ice,
and at the time,

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.980 align:middle line:84%
they were showing their food,
and they were suddenly frozen.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:84%
To explain whole fields
full of bones like this,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.020 align:middle line:90%
it just becomes absurd.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
When you have
catastrophic deposition,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.080 align:middle line:84%
the heavy materials
settle first,

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.940 align:middle line:90%
and then the lighter things.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, here, they found
the rocks, heavy rocks

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.130 align:middle line:90%
and the bones on the bottom.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:84%
As they go up, they get to
the finer sands and silts,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's where they find
a lot of the soft tissues.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So this indicates deposition
by action of water,

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.710 align:middle line:90%
but violent action.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.050 align:middle line:90%
This is not just over acres.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Were talking about
whole countries

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:52.830 align:middle line:90%
are covered with this.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.255 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the only reason you
see it frozen in Alaska,

00:45:55.255 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:84%
the only reason you
find the soft parts

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.210 align:middle line:84%
along with the bones in Alaska
is because the climate has

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.055 align:middle line:90%
preserved them.

00:46:02.055 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:84%
The idea that occurs to me is
that this catastrophe occurred

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.830 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the
climate was quite warm,

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and actually,
there were probably

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
mass migrations towards
the high latitude regions

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:90%
to get away from the heat.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it made
matters worse for them,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:84%
because then they got
it from the ice sheet

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:90%
with these glacier waves.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you had one of
these solar conflagrations

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:35.740 align:middle line:84%
occur at that time, you could
imagine the animals grazing

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.430 align:middle line:84%
in this region, because
it was warmer than normal,

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.150 align:middle line:84%
so there was quite a
lot of vegetation there.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And they would be eating
the grass or whatever

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing that
thousands of kilometers away,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
dams on the ice
sheet had broken,

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and water was coursing
down the ice sheet,

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.780 align:middle line:90%
gaining in momentum and energy.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a mountain's
wave 500 feet high,

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:84%
1,000 kilometers long, perhaps,
traveling down the ice sheet.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And these animals
wouldn't be aware of it

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.740 align:middle line:84%
until the thing had
left the ice sheet

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and was thundering
across the plains.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.420 align:middle line:90%
And what could they do?

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.100 align:middle line:84%
JOHANA LAMBERT: As many as
two superwaves may already

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.948 align:middle line:84%
have left the galactic
center and be speeding

00:47:32.948 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:84%
toward our solar system,
but there is no way

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.990 align:middle line:90%
that we can see them coming.

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Since a superwave
travels outward

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.700 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic center
at the speed of light,

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.960 align:middle line:84%
the radiation signaling
its initial emergence

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic core
would arrive only minutes

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.790 align:middle line:90%
ahead of its cosmic rays.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Once it arrives, a
superwave's presence

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.000 align:middle line:84%
becomes quite a noticeable
phenomenon in the heavens

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.940 align:middle line:84%
due to the light it
beams towards us.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I've suggested it's
possible to set up a shield

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:90%
using advanced technology.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:17.320 align:middle line:84%
This would require technology
beyond what is allowed to be

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.690 align:middle line:90%
in the unclassified world.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Now this is technology that's
so far advanced that it's

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.280 align:middle line:84%
kept classified,
and there's evidence

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have this because of
tests that have been going on.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's possible
to use this technology

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:90%
in a much larger scale.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.670 align:middle line:84%
This would require a project
that would dwarf the Apollo

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:41.100 align:middle line:84%
project, the Manhattan Project,
and all our black projects put

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.160 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.310 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about something
where we'd probably establish

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:84%
field transmitters
on several planets

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system that
were able to set up an energy

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.770 align:middle line:84%
shield outside the solar system
towards the galactic center

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.570 align:middle line:84%
side that would
be able to deflect

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:84%
cosmic rays around
our solar system

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.770 align:middle line:84%
before they were able to
reach our solar system.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.940 align:middle line:84%
In this way, by deflecting
the cosmic rays,

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.350 align:middle line:84%
it's just a very slight
angle just a few degrees.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.850 align:middle line:84%
If you can get the
shield out far enough,

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.860 align:middle line:84%
you just deflect those
cosmic rays by a few degrees,

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and you've been able to stop
being able to prevent them

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:84%
from pushing cosmic dust
into the solar system,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.410 align:middle line:84%
because once the cosmic dust is
pushed into the solar system,

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.110 align:middle line:84%
you get this whole
chain of events begun.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:36.600 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Many cultures,
mythologies, and people

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.930 align:middle line:84%
from all around
the planet believe

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that life in our universe
moves in great cycles.

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Some refer to these
cycles as ages or worlds.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.400 align:middle line:84%
These myths tell us of a
golden age, a silver age,

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.100 align:middle line:90%
a bronze, and an iron age.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.990 align:middle line:84%
The last age is called the
Kali Yuga by the Hindus,

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and they believe that it is
the age that we are in now.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Myths reveal that
the Iron Age is

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.190 align:middle line:90%
the most difficult age of all.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Man grows dark with his
technology and power,

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:84%
but even this age
will come to an end.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.842 align:middle line:84%
If the myths and legends of
our own past are correct,

00:50:20.842 --> 00:50:25.900 align:middle line:84%
a new golden age will
rise out of this age.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Possibly, the Earth itself
is transformed by the fire

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:34.330 align:middle line:84%
from the center of our galaxy,
and the ashes from this fire

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:38.030 align:middle line:84%
will be the seeds for
the world to come.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:42.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the promise
of the golden age.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.720 align:middle line:84%
The cycles of time
are like the weather,

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and as the seasons
of the galaxy pass,

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.726 align:middle line:84%
everything must learn to
adjust to these changes.

00:50:52.726 --> 00:50:55.650 align:middle line:84%
As surely as fall
turns to winter,

00:50:55.650 --> 00:51:00.120 align:middle line:84%
so too will these
larger cycles turn.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.914 align:middle line:84%
All of nature is dependent
upon the cycle of life, death,

00:51:04.914 --> 00:51:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and rebirth, for
this is the greatest

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:10.575 align:middle line:90%
mystery of the universe.

00:51:10.575 --> 00:51:15.720 align:middle line:90%

JOHANA LAMBERT: The
mysteries of the past

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and how our ancient
fathers and mothers viewed

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.020 align:middle line:84%
the universe around
them are only

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:28.150 align:middle line:84%
now coming to light with the
work of Dr. Paul LaViolette.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:32.010 align:middle line:84%
However, there are other
researchers also currently

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:36.570 align:middle line:84%
making discoveries that not only
confirm Dr. LaViolette's work,

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
but open the promise that
our ancestors knew far more

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.990 align:middle line:84%
about the universe
and the cosmos

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:46.290 align:middle line:84%
than modern minds
have ever dreamed.
