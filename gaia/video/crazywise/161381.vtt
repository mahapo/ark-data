00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:33.646 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I'm working
and fighting every single day,

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and I'm viewed as
a complete bum.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.988 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:90%
But that is my problem.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.622 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell anyone
what is going on with me.

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
People see me act
quiet, and that's it.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.225 align:middle line:84%
But what is happening in
that quiet is completely--

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:56.025 align:middle line:90%
it's just chaos.

00:00:56.025 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.555 align:middle line:90%
I experience screaming voices.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I go into almost a
paralysis from fear--

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
just being absolutely
exhausted, and frustrated,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and just tired of--

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
tired of everything--
and just not

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
wanting to fight
every single day.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
People don't believe
how insane I am.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Fuck!

00:01:34.490 --> 00:02:10.191 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>> At first, still has human
rights issues that took me

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:10%
to tribal and indigenous
cultures around the world.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
As a photographer,
I wanted to bring

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
viewers face to face with the
people who were struggling

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to hold on to their
unique way of life

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.715 align:middle line:90%
and their traditional beliefs.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I became fascinated with
the remaining cultures that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
commune with the spirits of
rivers, mountains, animals,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and their ancestors.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
While I was working in Northern
Kenya, I met [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
She was a 37-year-old
mother of five.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
When she was 13, she started
hearing voices and having

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
visions, said she was
feeling terrified.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But her grandmother took
her aside and told her

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
she had a very
special sensitivity,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and then helped guide
her through her crisis.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Today, she's a highly
respected healer and predictor

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:90%
in her Samburu tribe.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I've met
many people like [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
who could be labeled as crazy
in our culture but were seen

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:90%
as gifted in their own--

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
people who transform their
mental and emotional crises

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to become healers or visionaries
for their communities.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we often
call them Shaman.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:10%
And I began to
wonder, could there

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:10%
be something more to these
experiences we call crazy?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
When I was back home in Seattle,
I met a young man named Adam.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I was 20.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It was four days after my
20th birthday I went nuts.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.547 align:middle line:84%
Very compassionate-- be
it animals, be it people--

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:90%
at a very early age.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
He was just really a happy baby.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely amazing.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
He's the funniest guy
you would ever know.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've seen
that-- but hysterical-- totally

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:90%
gifted athletically.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:90%
He rode a two-wheel bike at two.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:90%
At five, he got into karate.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> He ended up as one of the
youngest kids to ever get his

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.675 align:middle line:84%
black belt. I think he
got that when he was 11.

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So in high school when I
met Adam, I was 15; he was 16.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
He had a cool, red Jeep
Wrangler, and he wakeboarded--

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and just really popular,
outgoing, charismatic guy--

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:90%
lots of friends.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was always kind
of challenging the status

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:90%
quo so to speak.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> He just knew what
I was thinking a lot.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I could be thinking of
something completely random,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and he wouldn't
know it and tell me.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it
would weird me out.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard that
from multiple people,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.755 align:middle line:90%
too-- other friends of his.

00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I moved to Florida to pursue
professional wakeboarding.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that period
is when I experienced

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:90%
that first depression.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> July 22nd, 2004--

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:90%
that was the date.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
He started telling us a math
equation that would solve

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
all the family's problems.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a very simple
one, but it made more sense

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to him, which, of
course, to nobody else.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When it first occurred,
it was very fun and exciting.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It was just this
total shattering,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and my mind just opened,
and I started thinking

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:90%
of all these different things.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
it was beautiful.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I found it was the
first time I'd ever

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
experienced a real
connection to the universe--

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
where I really felt
like a part of this--

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:90%
that I was this; this was me.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It was just like incredible.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Then I kept going.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.814 align:middle line:90%
And then I went way too far.

00:05:59.814 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And then it got scary.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was terrifying--

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.645 align:middle line:84%
totally manic or
totally depressed.

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:11.075 align:middle line:84%
>> The rage that will occur in
a manic episode is so scary.

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's not who we
knew as happy Adam, funny Adam.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you had this
Adam like [SNAP] that.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I was surprised to learn
how many people in the US will

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
suffer from a psychological
crisis in their lifetime.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And like many of
the shaman I met,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:10%
the crisis happens
mostly in their youth.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I met a young woman
in New York named

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Ekhaya, who also had one of
these episodes in her 20s.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know what
was happening to me.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I felt like my
whole world was just

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:84%
exploding like I was going
into a whole different reality

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:90%
that I knew nothing about.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I was very afraid to
walk down the street

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
because I thought people
were all focused on me

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and judging me, and I
thought everybody knew.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I had voices that would
tell me to cut myself.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It was like the voices were
taking control over me.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The visions were
taking control over me.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I was very sensitive
to music, to sounds.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I started to have very clear
visions of dead people--

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:84%
like just appearing
and watching me.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I had eyes
watching me all the time.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I started to see
my deceased father,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
and he would show up in my room.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And really, it was
the scariest thing

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever experienced.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I literally locked myself
in a room for months.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I took the light bulb
of a light fixture,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and I became
completely enclosed.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:59.496 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There was about a three-day
period of in my room,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
writing equations and
finding God in my notebook.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, my parents
were like, whatcha doing?

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I checked myself
into a mental institution.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
That is not the
place to get sane.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.495 align:middle line:84%
They put me in
this holding room.

00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was no door, and there
was a camera on the ceiling.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
laying on this bed,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and this little girl
walked into my room

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and she was just
staring at me, just

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:90%
with this blank, bizarre stare.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And I kept asking her to
leave, and she wouldn't.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And there was more
crazy people everywhere,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to
just come into my room.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I immediately felt
in danger and scared.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I just
decided, no, and we

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
went back to my parents'
house and just kind of tried

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what to do.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
They put me on
Depakote, and then

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that just started the whole
process of, oh, no, now he's

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:90%
crying all day.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's feed him this one.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, now he's
barfing all day.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Feed him this one.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And we went from one doctor
to another doctor and one

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
prescription to
another prescription.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.972 align:middle line:84%
>> He was on every medication,
I think, made for bipolar.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And they always say, well,
every brain is different.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Sorry if this makes
you crap your pants.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it'll work.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'll make
you kill yourself.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the disclaimer
on these pills--

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that's typically the
first side effect--

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:90%
is suicidal thoughts.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:10%
And that's what the doctor's
giving you to feel better.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's--
[LAUGHS] it's crazy.

00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Hearing of the struggles Adam
and Ekhaya were going through

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:10%
made me want to learn more.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So I started
interviewing experts

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.227 align:middle line:90%
in the field of mental health.

00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In the United States, we've
come to believe in the chemical

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
imbalance theory of
mental disorders.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:10%
So we believe that you
have some known deficiency

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:10%
with the neurotransmitter,
and the drugs fix that,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:10%
like insulin for diabetes.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:10%
It was a valid
hypothesis that arose out

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:10%
of our understanding of how
the drugs acted on the brain,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:10%
and then it was investigated
and found out basically not

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:10%
to be so.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.034 align:middle line:90%
I believed it.

00:10:15.034 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was a reporter,
I wrote about it.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Our depression is
due to low serotonin.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenia is due
to too much dopamine.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I called up
some top researchers

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I just want
to see the research that

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
says you found that
people with schizophrenia

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:84%
had too much
dopamine or you found

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that people with depression
had too little serotonin.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never
forget the answer.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The answer was, well,
we never found that.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you mean
you never found that?

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's just a metaphor,
but it's not really true.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, not really.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.406 align:middle line:90%
And I was stunned by that.

00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I am very much against
the casual and careless use

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of medication that characterizes
American society today.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
These medicines are very,
very powerful in helping,

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
but they can be very
powerful in harming.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Often the withdrawn
problems will be worse

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.766 align:middle line:90%
than the original condition.

00:11:01.766 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I can look at any clinic I've
worked at, and if they've been

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:84%
in the clinic for
15 or 20 years,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
they've been on every
category of antipsychotic

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that they
still have the same symptoms.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
They still have the
same side effects.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They still are operating
at the same level.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.932 align:middle line:84%
They may have been hospitalized
five, six, 10 times

00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:21.765 align:middle line:90%
during that process.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>> We've been primed to believe
that, with medical research,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:10%
we can find the causes of things
and that we can create these

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:10%
magic bullets that
fix these problems.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:10%
So it fit into that larger
story of medical progress

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:10%
that we believe in.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:10%
We've been embracing
this paradigm of care

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:10%
now for almost 30
years, and we've

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:10%
seen the burden go
up, and up, and up.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an
effective medical treatment

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
for a disease, at the very
least, that burden of disease

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
should hopefully stay
stable or even go down.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.758 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
exactly the opposite.

00:11:53.758 --> 00:11:56.964 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.964 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know why I was here.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:90%
I had no purpose.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I had
any reason to breathe.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel deserving
of love, of anything.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The first suicide attempt was,
I took a whole bottle of pills.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
The second attempt
was me walking out

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
of the house headed into
a busy street traffic.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.746 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted a car to hit me,
or a truck, or just something

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
to take me out,
because this time

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:90%
I wanted it to really work.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I always felt like
I was the problem.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And if I could get
rid of the problem,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:90%
everyone else would be OK.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I decided to try to
get some kind of help.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the hospital
for about six weeks.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I was put on several different
medications-- heavy drugs,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
anti-psychotics, and it really
changed who I was completely.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I gained 70 pounds in the
first 2 and 1/2 months.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I just felt drugged up.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%

the side effects were just

awful, absolutely awful--

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
like these awful
anxiety attacks.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.405 align:middle line:84%
And the thought of
interacting with people

00:13:21.405 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
would make me sick
to my stomach.

Did I cause this?

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.155 align:middle line:90%
Did we do something as parents?

00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And the pain that you
see him going through

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and the inability to
do anything to help it

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.265 align:middle line:90%
are the toughest things.

him out of the room,

I was left wondering
what happened.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, I was invited

thought he might be dying.

make room for your
differentness,

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.104 align:middle line:84%
where connection is not
broken but is maintained,

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
excluded and ostracized

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.987 align:middle line:84%
but where you're
welcomed, and where

00:17:52.987 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
there's room for you to act out
whatever you need to act out--

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.739 align:middle line:84%
or to express whatever
you need to express.

00:17:57.739 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And the whole community
might even sing with you,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
or chant with you,
or hold ceremony.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Meaning-- find some meaning in
your quote unquote "craziness."

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:10%
>> As our film progressed, we
began hearing from people who

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:10%
identified themselves
as survivors--

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:10%
meaning survivors of our
mental health care system.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Many had come out from the
shadows of their diagnosis

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and labels by meeting
each other online

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to share their experiences
and to form support groups.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Will Hall is on the forefront
of what is called the recovery

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.785 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first
was hospitalized,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling so desperate
that I wanted to die.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to kill myself.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was hearing very,
very aggressive voices,

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.695 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up walking to
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:52.475 align:middle line:84%
And I remember dragging my arm
against the chain-link fence,

00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and my fingers were bloody.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
bridge and I looked down,

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I really felt like I
needed to end my life.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I was
this complete failure.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was in really
bad, bad shape.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And the mental health
system only made that worse.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I went to the clinic
in San Francisco.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
My therapist had recommended
that maybe I should

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:90%
try different medications.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was buzzed
into the clinic.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what was coming,

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:90%
but the door locked behind me.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It was like there was this wild
animal that they had captured,

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and they were evaluating it.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was put in restraints,
and I was not resisting,

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:90%
or arguing, or being hostile.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Finally, after doing
all these tests,

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
the resident psychiatrists
who had been working with me

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:90%
came in and sat down.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, Mr. Hall, we
have your results of this test.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.065 align:middle line:90%
We have your diagnosis.

00:19:46.065 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It was this very solemn,
ceremonial moment.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you have
a severe mental illness.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
You have a kind of
schizophrenia called

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
schizoaffective disorder.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It combines the criteria
for schizophrenia

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:84%
with the criteria
for bipolar disorder.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.609 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
this catchall diagnosis.

00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
winning the lottery

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:90%
of severe mental illness.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.299 align:middle line:90%
And they said, there's no cure.

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no cure for this.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You will be maintaining
yourself on medication

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:90%
to manage your symptoms.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We really recommend that you
rethink some of your goals

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
That moment was really
like casting a spell on me.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were in the
process of transforming me

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
from an ordinary,
full human being

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
into the second-class citizen
of being a mental patient.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I interviewed a group of
people that had been diagnosed

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
for their mental emotional
distress and asked each

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
of them, what was
your diagnosis.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Schizophrenia, schizotypal,
schizoid personality,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:84%
schizoaffective, bipolar
I and bipolar II.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> ADD, dysthymia,
depression, and PTSD.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Borderline personality,
they put autism,

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
they put Asperger's, they
put manic depressive--

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think I was that.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Manic depression,
bipolar, bipolar I,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and just one time
schizoaffective.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In the era of the DSM-3,
there were like 12 personality

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
disorders, and I
had eight of them.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And the perfectionist in me
wanted to try and get all 12.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:10%
>> I learned that all these
diagnoses come from a book

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:10%
called The DSM, the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:10%
of Mental Disorders published
by the American Psychiatric

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:10%
Association.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, the
number of disorders

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.705 align:middle line:84%
has increased dramatically
with each new addition.

00:21:58.705 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with the DSM-5
is it took a number of normal

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:84%
aspects of life and
pathologized them--

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:84%
normal grief because
major depressive disorder.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Overeating becomes
binge eating disorder.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Temper tantrums become
disruptive mood dysregulation

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It's taking the experiences
of everyday life

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that are unavoidable, part
of the human condition,

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.172 align:middle line:84%
turning them into
medical disorders.

00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual is basically

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
a sophisticated way of
not listening to people.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You interview just so that
you've heard certain keywords,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
you fit it into your
framework, and then

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle line:84%
you've got a whole
algorithm of treatments

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that you offer
people so that when

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
your colleagues and your
supervisors ask you,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing
to this person?

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:90%
You're following the protocol.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If we used all
these psychiatric tests

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
on the healthy population, I
doubt that anyone would avoid

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:90%
to get at least one diagnosis.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
We think that there are people
who are normal over here,

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
pathological ones who

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
have depression, or anxiety,
or addiction, or schizophrenia,

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.144 align:middle line:84%
bipolar disorder, ADHD, or any
number of other conditions.

00:23:20.144 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:90%
What I see is a continuum.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:84%
These traits, to one
degree or another,

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:90%
are present in almost everybody.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mythology to
think that there's the normal

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and then there's the abnormal.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.302 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.302 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Three months
into our filming,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Adam asked to be interviewed.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:84%
He had just started his fourth
10day meditation retreat,

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and painful childhood
memories began coming up.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
When he went to
the retreat leaders

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and revealed his
mental health history,

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.856 align:middle line:84%
they decided it was
best for him to leave.

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I went
to the Vipassana center,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a memory of when I was
really young and just being

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:90%
in a bathroom.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:16.520 align:middle line:90%
It was involving a relative.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like dancing around.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I was molested as a child, and
it was involving a relative.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Once I realized my
grandfather had molested me,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I went to speak to my parents,
and they didn't believe me.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm losing my house.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm losing my job.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just walked away
from all my bills,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:90%
just looking into the abyss.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I began believing

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that my mother molested
me, my father molested me.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:90%
My mind just, I think--

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.706 align:middle line:90%
it couldn't handle it anymore.

00:24:57.706 --> 00:25:01.354 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.354 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:10%
>> So if I have an
unusual way of feeling,

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:10%
and my emotions are really
big, and having a hard time,

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:10%
and the culture and my
family doesn't support that,

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.290 align:middle line:10%
I can go off into a really
isolated way and become very,

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:10%
very disturbed-- alienated,
isolated, more chaotic,

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.226 align:middle line:10%
more rigid, and you
give me a label.

00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we look
at someone whose

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
"mind--" that is their feelings,
their thoughts, their behavior

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
is off--

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and then we say, oh,
they have a bad brain.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then either you isolate them
because you're afraid of them

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
or you give them pills
or whatever you do.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And medication is
sometimes essential.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't first start
with communities of support,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
then of course
the brain is going

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to stop functioning so
well, because the brain is

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:90%
a social organ.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Relationships are just as
important as brain processes,

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and I feel very
deeply that if we

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
could make that
clear to everyone,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:84%
we could have a shift
in how we actually

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:90%
take care of each other.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.712 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.712 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> This is myself and
my best friend Mia.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And she was a huge part
of my life-- someone

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:90%
that I could trust.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:90%
And we lived together.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:90%
We moved to New York together.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> We wrote together.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:90%
We sung together.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
We managed an art
gallery together.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:90%
We created a business together.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So we were very much a
part of each other's lives.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> During one of
my lowest points,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:84%
she didn't quite understand
what was happening.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When I look at her, this
is not the person that I had

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:90%
originally met.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And then she was on medication
when she was in that hospital.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was changing her.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:84%
By my analysis-- and I
may be clearly wrong--

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like she was
being very manipulative.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a day where she
got out of the hospital,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and I met her.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I gave her money for
travel, and I put her in a cab.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I took her to lunch,
and she was supposed

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
to go to kind of
like a group home.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:90%
And she attempted suicide again.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be a crutch
for her anymore.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And for a year, I
didn't speak to her.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the hardest things

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done as a friend.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I think it broke her heart, too.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.984 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.984 --> 00:27:34.785 align:middle line:84%
>> I called her, and I was
experiencing some issues

00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:90%
and really depressed.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.195 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
you know, I don't

00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:90%
feel like I can live anymore.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:10%
And she told me to
get over myself.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to
say, I mean, we've

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:10%
reconciled our relationship,
and she's back in my life,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:10%
and we've talked about this
and healed over these things.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But that is the worst thing
that you could say to someone.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Another friend of
mine understood

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.245 align:middle line:90%
what I was going through.

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember actually
talking to her on the phone,

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and talking to her in person,
and smiling a lot with her

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and saying, this
is not a breakdown.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:90%
This is a breakthrough!

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like, literally
breaking down a wall

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and going through another
path to be that person you're

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be and being willing
to accept that people are going

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to reject you on some level--
your own family, your friends.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.295 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.295 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, I
connected with that.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I myself had attempted suicide
probably four or five times

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And it took me some
time to figure out

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that that feeling
inside was about not

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.945 align:middle line:84%
wanting to be here the
way that I was here,

00:28:41.945 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
not not wanting to be here.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't have enough people
in our lives to look at it

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:10%
differently from a peer
perspective and say,

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:10%
you know what?

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:90%
I've been through this.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I know where you are.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I've actually
experienced myself.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:10%
Someone that hasn't
experienced it,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:10%
it's very, very hard for
them to see through it.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> [SINGING]
Sometimes the music--

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:90%
she's just like a lover.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:90%
She'll try to lead you astray.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been living in
my car for three months--

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:90%
or a little over three.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I have incredible
people in my life.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And right as I lost my family,
I found a brand new one

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:90%
that is incredible.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.190 align:middle line:84%
This place, SoulFood
family, they are amazing.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.580 align:middle line:84%
It is just a beautiful community
of open-minded, loving people.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people
would say that Adam was broken,

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:90%
and I don't view it that way.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.486 align:middle line:84%
I think our culture
is broken, not Adam.

00:29:40.486 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
We say there's
something wrong with you

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
instead of actually addressing
the fact that, as a society,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.365 align:middle line:84%
we don't have the skills to
be able to support somebody

00:29:49.365 --> 00:29:50.165 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:50.165 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> [SINGING] --to wonder what
the mantis really wanted when

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
she ate her lover after
sex in the garden.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you think she
missed him at all?

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.618 align:middle line:90%
Oh, did she miss him at all?

00:30:06.618 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> He seems to just tune right
into what people are feeling.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he knows how
not to feel it for them.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd be a great
psychologist maybe someday

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:84%
or work with kids,
and he doesn't need

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
to end up in the back of a car.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> [SINGING] Guess
I'll never know.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Being here and finding
that love, and comfort,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and just the
acceptance saved me.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Without that, with just being
in your head, having nothing

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
other than rejection to what
you're experiencing going on

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely maddening.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the problems in this
industrial society is that

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:10%
the so-called normal people--

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:10%
they don't want to admit that
they're psychotic, actually.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.660 align:middle line:90%
We live in a psychotic society.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And what is meant by psychotic?

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.495 align:middle line:90%
Out of touch with reality.

00:31:07.495 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When somebody who's
in this delicate state--

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:90%
you know, they're in a process.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
They're sent to prison,
they're sent to jail,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
they're sent to a
psychiatric ward,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.117 align:middle line:84%
or they're chemically
incarcerated,

00:31:18.117 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:90%
or they're homeless.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not against medications.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against hospitals.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against doctors.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I know many people who are
benefited by medications.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But we have a one-size-fits
all framework.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
We think that the
issue is biological;

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the solution is medical
and pharmaceutical;

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and we see it as
objective science.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.335 align:middle line:90%
It's not objective science.

00:31:39.335 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Most non-Western cultures,
it's assumed that if people

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:84%
hear voices or they have
very unusual beliefs,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
there's meaning to
those experiences.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Only in the Western world have
developed this bizarre idea

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that hearing voices and
having strange ideas

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:90%
has no meaning at all.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just a symptom of
these imagined illnesses

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.065 align:middle line:84%
that biological psychiatry
is actually created.

00:32:05.065 --> 00:32:17.436 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> While mentoring young
photographers on the Navajo

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
nation, I met Morgan
[? Yazzie ? ].

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:10%
He said he had been
having dizzy spells

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:10%
and hallucinations in his
20s but tried to ignore them.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They started to happen more
frequently until he finally

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:90%
had what he called a stroke.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.530 align:middle line:84%
His friend, Sam
[INAUDIBLE],, a medicine man,

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.460 align:middle line:84%
did a ceremony for him and
told Morgan he was ignoring

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:90%
a calling--

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
a calling to be a medicine man.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this
several times before.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:84%
If you ignore the
calling, there's

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.170 align:middle line:84%
a good chance that you could
get sick and possibly die.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Many say it's a transformation
waiting to happen

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:90%
that has to be dealt with.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:10.585 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.585 --> 00:33:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't go into
the bathroom to shower

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:84%
because people
were smoking crack.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was about
to harm myself again,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't want that.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I called the nurse's
station, and one of the nurses

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.820 align:middle line:90%
said, come back.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Come back and we'll help you.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I had an intake with
the psychiatrist

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:90%
at the emergency room.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.771 align:middle line:84%
And after him questioning
me, and seeing my records,

00:33:34.771 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that I had
been in the hospital

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:84%
for already six weeks,
he didn't believe me.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
to send you home--

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.900 align:middle line:90%
that you don't need to be here.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of the
emergency room door.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%

shielded myself and told them

that I didn't want
to fight them,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.440 align:middle line:84%

to just beat me.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of them picked up,
I guess, a rock that was--

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I guess to be about
the size of my own head

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and just picked it
up over his head

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and just spiked it
down on my face.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And it fractured my jaw
in half right here--

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:84%
just totally all the way to
the teeth, just separated this.

And after they smashed
the rock in my face,

00:43:38.771 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:10%

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.025 align:middle line:84%

Although I'm

had happened, but my

and it was just
swept under the rug.

Covering was used-- just
suppression of symptoms.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.700 align:middle line:84%
The uncovering was
you do something--

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.850 align:middle line:84%
some process-- psychotherapeutic
process, depth psychology

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.340 align:middle line:84%

to go to the core--

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.260 align:middle line:90%
to the underlying reason.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And now what we
see more and more,

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:90%
for a variety of reasons--

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.230 align:middle line:84%
not the least of
which is the influence

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:20.870 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical
companies--

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:84%
you see more and more
shift towards trying

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to solve everything with
this suppression of symptoms.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What becomes suppressed is
our authenticity, our emotions.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we become
25 and 30 or 35, 40--

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.845 align:middle line:90%
and we don't know who we are.

00:49:37.845 --> 00:49:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asks
us, what do you feel?

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.100 align:middle line:90%
You say, I have no idea.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So then it becomes not our first
nature, but our second nature

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to suppress our feelings, to
lose touch with ourselves,

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.536 align:middle line:84%
and to suppress
our gut feelings.

00:49:51.536 --> 00:49:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we pay the cost
later on in the form

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of addictions, mental
illness, or any range

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.560 align:middle line:90%

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:84%

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I became really,
really depressed again.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I started to treat my
children differently.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to be the
best mother that I could be.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I found
myself doing things

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.960 align:middle line:84%
like yelling and lashing
out, it wasn't right,

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're seeing happen in
the US and internationally is

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:09.200 align:middle line:84%
a grassroots democratization
of mental health.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.500 align:middle line:84%
We have lost touch
in our medical system

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.500 align:middle line:84%
from some of the simple
needs that people

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.960 align:middle line:84%
have for connection-- the
simple needs that people

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.700 align:middle line:90%
have for community.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.486 align:middle line:84%
And because the mental health
system isn't providing it,

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
people who've been in
the system are starting

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.742 align:middle line:90%
to provide it for ourselves.

01:00:26.742 --> 01:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Today's session is about
finding strength after trauma.

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.120 align:middle line:84%
As a survivor of
childhood trauma,

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
as someone who was sexually
abused by a family member,

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I can say that I'm a
survivor of trauma,

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.348 align:middle line:90%
and I know that I'm not alone.

01:00:46.348 --> 01:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very, very important
that we have storytelling from

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
people who've lived through
psychosis and who've discovered

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
alternatives to medications
and alternatives to diagnosis

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%
because that's
really the expertise.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Your story is important.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.025 align:middle line:90%
You are unique.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:04.000 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Own your title--
trauma survivor.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.774 align:middle line:90%
Find your strength.

01:01:08.774 --> 01:01:12.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on, [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:12.678 --> 01:01:15.606 align:middle line:90%


01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> My mother-- now
she's facing death.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Me sharing my spiritual
side with her--

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.550 align:middle line:90%
she was open to it.

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And she really did listen to me.

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
first times in so long

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that I had been able to
share my heart with someone

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.034 align:middle line:90%
in my family.

01:01:40.034 --> 01:01:45.710 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
It's been really
intense on the family.

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:51.620 align:middle line:90%
It's been really intense on me.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I see the death of my
mother being a catalyst

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
to bring a whole lot of
necessary love and appreciation

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.802 align:middle line:90%
into my family.

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:03.778 align:middle line:90%
And that was what she was about.

01:02:03.778 --> 01:02:09.710 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The first time I was diagnosed
insane I had something to say.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked back at the
things that I had to say,

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
any of it's insane.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a very damaging
thing to not

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
be able to trust
your own perspective.

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:28.366 align:middle line:84%
When you can't do that,
that really fucks you up.

01:02:28.366 --> 01:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What we do in the West
is to constrain individuals.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
People start to
manage your experience

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
at a level which takes
your agency away, robs you

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.375 align:middle line:84%
of your autonomy, makes you
feel like they don't trust you.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:45.685 align:middle line:90%
That's not what you want to do.

01:02:45.685 --> 01:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Once I internalized a
mentally ill identity--

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
once I came to see myself as
having this disease living

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
inside of me, I stopped
trusting in my intuition,

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.450 align:middle line:90%
because it was sick.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
find myself again

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and to get back to an authentic
sense of self is to feel this,

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and to listen to it,
and to explore it,

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.499 align:middle line:90%
and to not be afraid of it.

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:14.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I started to do.

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:24.410 align:middle line:90%


01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:28.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I traveled to the Amur
River in Eastern Siberia,

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.440 align:middle line:10%
where the word
shaman originated.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.340 align:middle line:90%


01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
There, I met [INAUDIBLE],,
a very respected healer

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
for over 60 years.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.240 align:middle line:90%


01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
She was forced to practice
in secret for decades

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.830 align:middle line:84%
until the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1989

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and was just one of
two remaining shaman

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:53.770 align:middle line:90%
in her [INAUDIBLE] culture.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Nine-year-old
Sasha-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
neighbor in their village.

01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Her grandmother told us that
Sasha has fainting spells

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and hears voices,
both considered

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%
signs of shamanic potential.

01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:11.200 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, just three
weeks after my visit,

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.090 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE] passed away,
leaving Sasha without a mentor.

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:18.280 align:middle line:10%
At the time, it seemed
I was witnessing

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.770 align:middle line:10%
the disappearance of
an age-old tradition

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:23.470 align:middle line:10%
in this corner of Siberia.

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
However, as I later
discovered, shamanism

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is re-emerging in very
unexpected places.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Ekhaya met a South African
shaman, known as a sangoma,

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
living in Baltimore and
began working with her.

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>> She told me that I was
called to be a healer, a shaman.

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had been feeling
that inside of me.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
we need confirmation.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my
absolute-- as soon as she

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.040 align:middle line:90%
said that, I was in tears.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Her exact words were, you
should be doing what I'm doing.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.032 align:middle line:84%
You have priesthood
responsibilities.

01:04:59.032 --> 01:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
You should be doing
what I'm doing.

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:03.250 align:middle line:90%


01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I get on a packed
bus for a four-hour

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
trip to Baltimore, Maryland,
where my baba is, my teacher.

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, I'm
just really meditating

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and just preparing
myself for everything,

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
because it is a lot
of intense work--

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.603 align:middle line:84%
beautiful work but
very intense work.

01:05:22.603 --> 01:05:26.950 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:32.280 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
The sangoma training involves
humbling yourself completely

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:40.515 align:middle line:84%
to your teacher and
to your ancestors.

01:05:40.515 --> 01:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> What you have to do as
a twaza is submit yourself,

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
your ego, all of your beliefs.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.470 align:middle line:90%
You have to sit on the floor.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:51.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to eat with your hands.

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:53.806 align:middle line:84%
You have to surrender
to your ancestors.

01:05:53.806 --> 01:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>> A twaza is an initiate to
become a traditional South

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:01.260 align:middle line:90%
African healer.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> During slavery, we
lost a lot of who we were.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But what you can't
take from a person

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.420 align:middle line:90%
is what's in their blood.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in your blood,
it's going to be in you.

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
The only way that she
received the calling

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is because someone in her family
was a traditional South African

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:18.220 align:middle line:90%
healer.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Her ancestors that are in her
blood-- that they're saying,

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.990 align:middle line:90%
wake up.

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
They're waking her up to them
to say, you are our child,

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:30.025 align:middle line:84%
and this is how we
want you to live.

01:06:30.025 --> 01:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> At the start
of my initiation,

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I experienced all of the
problems that I was having,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.410 align:middle line:84%
all of the anxieties
and depression,

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:43.500 align:middle line:90%
and I was being pushed.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I hurt, and I cried,
and my body ached.

01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:51.720 align:middle line:90%
The medications drown you out.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.220 align:middle line:90%
They mask you.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
They put a fog
over your problems,

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and you really are in
touch with yourself.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel things.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I've had to face all my
fears, all the things that

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
made me upset and angry, all
the people that I've hurt.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I've had to face
it and be with it

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:13.474 align:middle line:84%
before I was able to
release it and let it go.

01:07:13.474 --> 01:07:20.166 align:middle line:90%


01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Adam started turning a corner
and moved into an apartment

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.480 align:middle line:90%
with a friend.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It had been three
long years since he

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
was turned away from
the meditation center

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and alienated from his family.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I had an opportunity for
about a year to be an autistic

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
counselor, and that was
really powerful for me.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I know music therapy
is a practice

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
that more and more
people are looking into.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe I should be
one of those people.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah!

01:07:49.546 --> 01:07:55.825 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.825 --> 01:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> My mind was just interpreting
everything as hate and rape,

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's all it
knew at that point.

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what became this
evil personality in my head

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
that has gotten a lot better.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, my dad just called
me before this interview

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and was saying he originally
just wanted to be by himself.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, he wants
to come hang out.

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:24.790 align:middle line:90%
I think he's coming over here.

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.810 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have beers.

01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Merry Christmas.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.040 align:middle line:90%
That makes me so happy.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That's magic.

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's coming
over to my place.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I have a place for my

a very long way.

over the place, not
sure of herself,

all these things and energies.

I understand why I
have visions now.

I understand.

And I had to go find it.

You tell your therapist
or your psychiatrist,

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:32.130 align:middle line:90%

You have chronic depression.

That's just human.

If you ask anybody how they
survived an extreme tragedy

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
in their life, most
people are going

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:08.047 align:middle line:84%
to put spirituality in the
center of what helped them.

01:11:08.047 --> 01:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference from
mental health problems.

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize
that people's

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beliefs, and
their spiritual resources,

01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and their religion are
often central to give them

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.790 align:middle line:90%
the strength to make it through.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:25.500 align:middle line:90%

>> The paths are many.

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Some find it through religion.

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes religion is
an obstacle to that.

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:32.640 align:middle line:90%
In fact, often it is.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But it may be a conduit to
it as well, depending on who,

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.670 align:middle line:90%
and how, and where.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
There is this spiritual
nature that if we ignore,

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:44.430 align:middle line:84%
we're actually ignoring an
essential part of ourselves.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Human beings have certain
needs for meaning, for contact,

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:55.200 align:middle line:84%
for community, for
acceptance, for authenticity,

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
which is the capacity
to feel what we feel,

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and to be in touch
with our bodies,

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:02.616 align:middle line:84%
and to express what we
feel when we need to.

>> In the shamanic traditions,
there are maps and there are

compasses that you can use to
guide you through your dark

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:11.970 align:middle line:90%
night of the soul.

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're encouraged to explore
the depths of the psyche

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
with all of that
despair and suffering

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and to not get stuck there--

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to use that as some
point of initiation

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to open you up to lucidity and
a sense of personal destiny.

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There is something so
magnificently touching

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and moving to see how
people handle trauma.

01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you see the splendor
of the human spirit for those

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:49.590 align:middle line:84%
who don't allow themselves to be
victimized but become stronger

01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and more committed
to making sure

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't happen
to someone else.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What I would like to see is
that everyone who goes through

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
the kind of crisis that I went
through is given an opportunity

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to explore what it might
mean-- to present them with

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that maybe
it's not just a broken brain,

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:11.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not just an
illness, maybe this is not just

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
something to hide
and be ashamed of.

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:18.882 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something to
explore and learn from.

01:13:18.882 --> 01:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The film process has been
a perfect storm of everything

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
that scares me.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The interactions
with an older male

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and also just the experience
of cameras, of invasion,

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.040 align:middle line:90%
of allowing--

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
sharing every aspect of this
has been like a perfect thing

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
for me to get over trauma, and
really seeing, letting it--

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
this has been
terrifying in every way,

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:53.640 align:middle line:90%
but it's been also healing.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Phil has helped me so much--

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
someone coming to me
with an honest curiosity

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:02.650 align:middle line:84%
about my situation
instead of opinion.

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I hope that this film
ends up showing people

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.252 align:middle line:90%
that they are OK.

01:14:08.252 --> 01:14:12.491 align:middle line:90%


01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What helps all
of us stay well?

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's shelter.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.300 align:middle line:90%
It's exercise.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It's good food.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.770 align:middle line:90%
It's meaning in life.

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.480 align:middle line:10%
It's socialization.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.450 align:middle line:10%
And that immediately
breeds a sense

01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:29.920 align:middle line:10%
of optimism, a sense of hope
that you can have a breakdown

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.650 align:middle line:10%
but you can recover from
that with the right sort

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:35.010 align:middle line:10%
of environmental care.

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
How do we as a society provide
those things to people?

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
How do we build
up that foundation

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and not just put
a Band-Aid over it

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
but to really build a healthier
society for ourselves?

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I just think it's really
important for people to find

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.590 align:middle line:90%
some spiritual path.

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be shamanism.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:56.430 align:middle line:10%
It could be yoga;
it could be tai chi;

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:59.430 align:middle line:10%
it could be meditation--

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:03.180 align:middle line:10%
some spiritual path
that opens people up

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:05.550 align:middle line:10%
to their own
creative impulse and

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:07.305 align:middle line:10%
to their own spiritual power.

01:15:07.305 --> 01:15:10.620 align:middle line:10%

and alternative
holistic treatments.

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:15.930 align:middle line:10%
But in the mental health
system, really, all we offer

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:19.020 align:middle line:10%
is traditional psychotherapy
kind of stuff and drugs.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Now is the time for us to
be pressing for alternatives,

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
for new ways of
looking at things,

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
for funding peer support groups,
for getting options out there,

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
for bringing the holistic
medicine framework into mental

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.430 align:middle line:90%
health care.

01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Bring them out of
the closet, and that

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
will help fuel a movement that
says, look, we're out here.

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:43.135 align:middle line:84%
And then we can build a movement
that can make change happen.

01:15:43.135 --> 01:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to apologize
to my children.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Because of my
depression, because

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
of being without
shelter sometimes,

01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I abandoned them for
months at a time.

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:55.440 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't call.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be in contact.

01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't know what
was going on with me.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm so blessed that their
stepmother even called me

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
one day and said, hey,
we have space for you.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.870 align:middle line:84%
How about you come
out to California?

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:14.480 align:middle line:90%


01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a miracle to be in a space
where I can come and coparent

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
with my children and that all
three parents in the household

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.455 align:middle line:84%
can get along and agree to
do our best for our children.

I've been away from my
children for 10 years.

The suffering that
they've been through--

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I have to have complete
compassion for that.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.680 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to
take time for us

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.225 align:middle line:10%

When she's been going

she's been away from

else that other people
