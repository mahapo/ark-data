Violent diarrhea,

it the yellow death.

Like all Danish

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
used GM soy flour

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, what, 20%
GM in the soy mix.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And then it got
gradually more and more.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%

would have had 90%.

had to face frequent diarrhea

>> Just to see
what was happening.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And then pay attention, if
some different thing came up.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't tell my herdsmen.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And two days after,
he'd come, my herdsman,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.264 align:middle line:90%
have you changed the food?

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Said yeah.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it bad?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Not this time.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:90%
And he said, look.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I have no diarrhea.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no diarrhea here.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And he has used 100
milliliter antibiotic--

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:84%
to cure diarrhea that we
had massive problems with.

Up to 30% of piglets die.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:90%

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
is, and the good thing

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
is, we had three
years on non-GM.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%

This is where the tractor was.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Hidden in soy plants, there's
half a dozen chemical cans,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and herbicide glyphosate,
without which GM soy cannot

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%

Everything is growing
at the same time.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Weeds can suffocate soy.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:84%
This is when
glyphosate comes in.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
This herbicide kills everything,
everything but GM soy.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the soy has
been modified to resist.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.275 align:middle line:90%
It's become herbicide-proofed.

00:11:00.275 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%

>> With poison.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We use Roundup to
get rid of the weeds.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.958 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.052 align:middle line:84%

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:90%
But you export it, don't you?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%

your chickens with it,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:84%

>> Why?

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:90%

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And that may be linked
to chemical use.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how they use it,
they're not cautious enough.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.616 align:middle line:90%
The population is too exposed.

00:18:58.616 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And also, we don't know what
combinations of chemicals

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:90%
are being used.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:90%
We never heard of that before.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Transgenic firms have
always guaranteed

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
need anything else

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
but glyphosate to
weed the fields.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
As confessed by the
Ministry for Science,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
farmers are adding unknown
substances out of any control.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:90%
What are those chemicals?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Near a cornfield, there's
a spreading tractor.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
No one around.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
On the tractor,
we find glyphosate

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:90%
produced by Monsanto.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Nothing surprising.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But we also find two
other chemicals, atrazine,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:90%
which is forbidden in Europe.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
According to an American study,
atrazine turns male frogs

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:90%
into female frogs.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
There's also 2.4-D, one of the
two components of Agent Orange,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:90%
a military herbicide.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
To find enemies hidden in the
forest during the Vietnam War,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the American army had
been weeding the forests.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Very efficient, except for the
people who were underneath.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of deformed
children were

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.025 align:middle line:90%
born in the following years.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Today, American health
authorities assert that 2.4-D

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:84%
was the least dangerous
component of Agent Orange.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Dow Chemical is selling
it all across Argentina.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:90%
These products are toxic.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:90%
They seep through subsoil water.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
The transgenic
promise was a world

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:90%
with less and less chemicals.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is
the very opposite.

What's going on?

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Governmental agronomists
encouraged farmers

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
to massively shift to GM crops.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And now they are
facing mutant enemies.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.025 align:middle line:90%

>> Yes, pretty much.

>> What happened?

00:21:10.455 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:84%
By sewing 30 million
hectares of GM soy,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:19.676 align:middle line:84%
resistant to glyphosate, with
3 or 4 applications a year,

00:21:19.676 --> 00:21:22.176 align:middle line:84%
today, weeds that are resistant
to glyphosate have appeared.

00:21:22.176 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.283 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have to constantly
increase the quantity?

00:21:27.283 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we mix
different active substances

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
to prevent weeds from
adapting to herbicides.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.445 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
By mixing ingredients, we
prevent their resistance.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:90%
What happens is the contrary.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Glyphosate is no longer
enough to control weeds.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, three, four, or five other
chemicals need to be added.

will be designed

Some farmers are
showing huge resistance.

>> They want to have the
French government approve GMOs.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Here's an idea.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.365 align:middle line:84%
How about boycotting
French champagne?

00:32:52.365 --> 00:32:54.510 align:middle line:90%

put a ban on their champagne.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:90%

Who was the French farmer
attending the meeting

at the US embassy?

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.440 align:middle line:84%
He's very likely to
be a corn producer.

They have been struggling
to get the right

to plant GMOs, from
which they expect

a 10% rise on their yields.

episode of low intensity war,
a war aimed at imposing GMOs

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:90%
on the whole planet.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:84%
This war is not
waged by soldiers,

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.950 align:middle line:90%
but by influence peddlers.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:90%
How do they look like?

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
There are many of them in
Brussels, where the European

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.360 align:middle line:90%
They make laws.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
transgenic industry

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.750 align:middle line:90%
settled its lobby, EuropaBio.

well, all GM big names.

Among the transgenic

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.670 align:middle line:90%
is certainly the fiercest.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.010 align:middle line:84%
He markets himself
as former member

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.830 align:middle line:90%
of Greenpeace and an ecologist.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, I'm Patrick Moore.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the
co-founders in Greenpeace

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:84%
back in the early 1970s while
I was doing my PhD in ecology.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I've been an independent
environmentalist

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:90%
for the last 25 years.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm leading the campaign
to allow golden rice now.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Patrick Moore left
Greenpeace almost 30 years ago,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.490 align:middle line:90%
reportedly on bad terms.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Ever since, he has become one
of Greenpeace's worst enemies.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:84%
He's supporting the nuclear
industry, mine industry,

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:90%
transgenic industry.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And he also thinks
global warming

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.670 align:middle line:90%
is great for the planet.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --during the Ice Age.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It is extremely likely
that a warmer temperature

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.170 align:middle line:84%
than today's would be far
better than a cooler one.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Patrick Moore is
an event professional.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:84%
On the GMOs chapter, he launched
a campaign for golden rice.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:84%
This experimental rice,
enriched in beta carotene,

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is the transgenic
industry's answer

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to kids' vitamin A deficiency
in the third world.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.440 align:middle line:84%
According to Patrick Moore,
criticizing golden rice

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.810 align:middle line:90%
makes you guilty of genocide.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> With two million
children dying each year,

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:84%
when their parents are watching
them die because they do not

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:84%
have vitamin A, golden
rice is the cure.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet, Greenpeace
continues to tell lies,

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.500 align:middle line:84%
saying it could have some health
problems from golden rice.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:90%
So they are lying.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And they are causing death.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.118 align:middle line:84%
And that is a crime
against humanity.

00:39:10.118 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Other VIPs are

Owen Patterson.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.300 align:middle line:84%
He's a die-hard
defender of GMOs,

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:84%
but feels a little
uncomfortable being

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.745 align:middle line:84%
filmed in an event financed
by the transgenic industry.

We are going to be
severely supervised.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The room is filled with
transgenic industry executives

no cameras.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.864 align:middle line:90%
about golden rice.

00:40:59.765 --> 00:41:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and I do think this is the
absolute [? panic here, ?]

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.776 align:middle line:84%
issue, someone is going
to get under the ball

00:41:04.776 --> 00:41:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and lose this one.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.682 align:middle line:90%
And then the dam will be broken.

00:41:08.682 --> 00:41:10.755 align:middle line:84%
And I just find
completely extraordinary

00:41:10.755 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that rational human
beings can oppose

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:18.050 align:middle line:84%
a technology which could stop
a small child going blind

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:90%
every second.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But I do think the
golden rice battle is

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:90%
absolutely fundamental.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Suddenly,
borders are blurred.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Is the minister
a public officer?

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Or is he a GM industry lobbyist?

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Since this meeting, he was fired
from the British government

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:90%
with no official reason.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Are all these people here
for the third world kids,

or for their
companies' interests?

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.920 align:middle line:84%

GM lobbyists invite
us to rather interview

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the great defender of GM golden
rice, Patrick Moore, who's

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.320 align:middle line:84%
accusing Greenpeace of
crime against humanity.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Right before the
interview, I find out

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:84%
on the website of
the institution that

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:84%
is developing golden rice
that it is not ready yet

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.640 align:middle line:90%
and still has to be evaluated.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So Greenpeace has nothing
to do with the pending.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Is Patrick Moore trying
to manipulate us?

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, is the research
about golden rice stopped?

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The research on golden rice
has been given a big boost

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.227 align:middle line:84%
by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation.

00:42:51.227 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's going on.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%

but the institution that is

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:84%
working on research on golden
rice said it needed a couple

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:84%
of years more to be able
to commercialize it.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they need a couple
of years more to comply with

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.610 align:middle line:84%

have been put in place to stop

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:16.410 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.310 align:middle line:90%

>> How can you say it's a lie?

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it is a lie.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it's making it up
using false information.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.590 align:middle line:84%

that these people are saying.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.666 align:middle line:90%
It is made up.

00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.090 align:middle line:90%

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.340 align:middle line:84%

do with what I'm doing--

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.710 align:middle line:90%
nothing, zero.

I'm not even interested in it.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:84%

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.380 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.465 align:middle line:84%
You go on the record

00:44:22.465 --> 00:44:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding of it is
that it's a fabricated lie,

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.110 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that
glyphosate in Argentina

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:90%

>> No, but I know it's--

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's dangerous, right?

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:50.260 align:middle line:84%

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.300 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous--

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not dangerous to humans.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.580 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.788 align:middle line:84%

one glass of glyphosate?

00:44:56.788 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm not an idiot.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Interview me about golden rice.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm talking about.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:01.564 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

00:45:01.564 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, then it's finished.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Except this--

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Then the interview
is finished.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.845 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say that's a good
way to solve things.

00:45:06.845 --> 00:45:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.190 align:middle line:90%
You're a complete jerk.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.620 align:middle line:84%
the priority is to put down
the European regulation.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.720 align:middle line:84%
They even did a
cartoon to explain it.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.330 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> In Europe, politicians
decided to impose bureaucratic

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.770 align:middle line:90%
barriers to biotech.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:84%
That means European farmers
have had to wait, and wait,

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and wait, until new crops
are approved to grow or to be

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:84%
imported, because the
European approval system is

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:90%
slow and over-politicized.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.340 align:middle line:84%

industry thinks Europe is

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.840 align:middle line:90%
overprotective.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But this could come to an
end with an upcoming trade

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.310 align:middle line:90%
agreement, the TAFTA.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.220 align:middle line:84%
The treaty could align
European health regulations

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.380 align:middle line:90%
with the ones of the US.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the aim
of the agreement

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.860 align:middle line:90%
is simple and common sense.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.770 align:middle line:84%
For instance, did
you know that it

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.670 align:middle line:84%
was hard to sell European
cars in the US and vise versa,

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:90%
because of norm differences?

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.830 align:middle line:84%
The size of headlights,
handles, bumpers--

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.680 align:middle line:84%
everything is strongly regulated
and different from one country

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.480 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Once the agreement is signed,
pro-GM America and anti-GM

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Europe will share
the same regulations.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, whose
rules are going to win?

prevail over national laws.

Depending on how
the negotiations go,

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.880 align:middle line:84%
it is possible that no one
