The old thought was that when
you're done with adolescence,

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:90%
your brain is done growing.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
We now know that's
totally not true.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly
responding to input

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:90%
that changes its structure.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:84%
These areas would
be getting thicker.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything is stronger
because it's like a muscle,

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.870 align:middle line:84%
that the more you drive energy
and information through them

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:84%
by the control, the tension,
you do in meditation.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The idea of our
human evolution is

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that the area of
the brain where you

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
have a meeting of
automatic sensations

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that are coming with reflective,
thoughtful things you've

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:84%
learned from the past,
where those two meet

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
in the layers of the cortex
is actually expanded.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
implications of that

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is that you are
allowed to manipulate

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.570 align:middle line:84%
with your own intention
how you live on automatic

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:90%
or how you awaken your mind.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:84%
You shift your state into
a more receptive state

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.220 align:middle line:90%
rather than reactive state.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beginning of
the neural process of love.

was breaking down.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:84%
He was very hard to
communicate with.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.179 align:middle line:84%
He was like a ticking bomb
just waiting to go off.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think partially it's
because he was so stressed out

Greg, you have a problem.

This was somebody who I thought
was a really good person.

very ugly side of him.

The only way you
can change the world

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.155 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point, I
just wanted to push her away.

and that was the turning point.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:84%
That was the point
where I realized

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this to her.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.915 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this to myself.

It was the moment of truth where

And I've got to figure it out.

It was time for a change.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how or
where to even begin,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.364 align:middle line:84%
but my heart was pointing
me in a new direction.

00:36:36.364 --> 00:36:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%

>> Our paradigm is that the
brain controls the heart,

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:10%
but we're finding
out that's not true.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the heart
sends more information

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:10.270 align:middle line:84%
telling the brain what to do
than the brain tells the heart.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:84%
With every heartbeat, it's
putting out a very strong

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic field.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the magnetic
field of the heart

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is 5,000 times stronger than
the magnetic field of the brain.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.710 align:middle line:84%
These two centers
are designed to do

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:90%
different things complementary.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.203 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to get
them to work together.

00:37:33.203 --> 00:37:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Just put this
on your ear lobe.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:34.910 align:middle line:90%

00:37:36.243 --> 00:37:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these little pulses
or bumps-- that's a heartbeat.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So what the program
is doing is it's

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:84%
measuring the time
interval between each

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.880 align:middle line:90%
of these heartbeats.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
plot that up here

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:84%
in this top graph as your
Heart Rate Variability.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:84%
HRV, which stands for
Heart Rate Variability,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is the beat to beat
change in our heart rate.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is very different
than heart rate.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.145 align:middle line:84%
So heart rate is just how
many times does the heart

00:38:02.145 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:90%
beat in a minute.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But in a healthy
individual, somebody

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
who's healthy and
resilient, our heart rate

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.840 align:middle line:84%
changes with every
single heartbeat.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at it
over time, the heart's

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:90%
beating out a message.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The message that the
heart rhythms beat out

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is very much related
to our emotions.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We all feel, and we all
have the same desires for love

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%

frustration, anger, anxiety.

What we call "negative
emotions," "stress emotions,"

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:84%
really create incoherent,
jagged heart rhythm patterns.

of minutes sets in motion 1,400

changes in our body--

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:84%
the stress hormones
and all of that.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of those hormones
hang around for a long time.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.583 align:middle line:84%
They have what's called
a half-life of 12 hours.

00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you
put your attention

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.305 align:middle line:84%
in the center of your
chest and breathe

00:38:54.305 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
as though you're breathing right
into the center of your chest.

starting to shift the pattern.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Then the next step
is, while you're

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:84%
doing the heart-focused
breathing,

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.540 align:middle line:84%
