presents exciting news.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Is the divorce over?

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Are spirit and science
tying the knot once more?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Are the church
and the laboratory

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:90%
saying the same thing?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Out of the misty
ages of antiquity,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
the quest for the
divine and the quest

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
for knowledge about the
universe march hand-in-hand.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Sumer, there
was a god of astronomy,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
a god of horticulture,
a god of irrigation.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And the temple priests were
the scribes and technologists

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
investigating these
fields of knowledge.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Greece, philosophers
asking the questions

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of why are we here
developed the theory

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
of the atom, celestial
movements and human ethics.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Medieval Europe,
the Western church

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
rose to a position
of supreme power.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Kingmaker, landowner,
and purveyor

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of the truth, the church
took it upon themselves

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.615 align:middle line:84%
to be the one knower
of everything.

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:37.135 align:middle line:10%
The dogma was law.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Yet science had moved forward
and now challenged the dogma

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was the
center of the universe.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Copernicus, Bruno,
and Galileo all

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
felt the heavy
hand of the church.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
The Tragedy-- unable to
suppress science anymore,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
the church and science divided
knowledge and human endeavor.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Descartes invented dualism.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:10%
The church had the
unseen, science the seen,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:10%
and materialism was born.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
An uneasy truce-- scientists
were no longer being bound.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And they reacted
with a vengeance.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
All the unseen is
fantasy, delusion.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
We are strictly little
machines running

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in a predictable machine
universe governed

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:90%
by strict immutable laws.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
The church pushed back,
soulless scientists

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:90%
were condemned to hell.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Darwin countered, the
creator was nothing, nowhere.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
We are random mutations,
simply a carrier

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of DNA's relentless quest for
more in a meaningless universe.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, both science and
religion were hitting the wall.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
If everything was mechanistic
and God was the only creator,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:84%
then what were we
humans supposed to do?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Science dug ever deeper
into a dead universe

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and stumbled upon and
unlocked a mystery.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
In tiny corners
of space and time,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
scientists found
unfathomable energy

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and mind-numbing
mysteries, mysteries

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that suggest we
are all connected,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that the physical universe
is essentially non-physical.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Time and space are
just constructs

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:90%
of this non-materialness.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And today, renegade
scientists are

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:90%
meeting with religious leaders.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Conferences pushing forward a
meeting of science and spirit

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:90%
are springing up.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:10%
As the 20th century
blew open the doors

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:10%
of a mechanistic view,
will the 21st century

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:10%
blow down the iron wall between
the church and laboratory?

>> The rabbit hole and how deep
and how far we want to go is

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
really how far, how much do
you want to discover about

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:90%
your true nature.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Alice went down the rabbit
hole where she met the Mad

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Hatter.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:90%
The Hatter was mad.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was you want to
get out of the rabbit hole

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:90%
after you've gone in.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's two
stages to science.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
There's the crazy part where
you go down the rabbit hole.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the part where you

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
check the craziness
of your ideas

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
against a rigorous, strict,
straitjacket-like process.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the interesting
thing about science,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
the interesting thing
about physics is that it is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
a genuinely new and novel way
of trying to come to grips with

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I think the experimental method
which is important to physics

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is a very different business
from the method of revelation

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
or the method of meditation
or something like that.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's true that,
for example, adherents of, say,

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism could imagine
changing their beliefs based

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
on the outcomes of
some experiments people

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
do with electrons.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Quite this apparent rift
between the church and science

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
or between science and
religion emerged today.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I think the roots of
that are very deep.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it probably goes
back to a conviction

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that some of the books
of the scriptures

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:84%
like the book of Genesis,
which deals with beginnings,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
is actually telling us about
the origins of the world.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, in fact, any biblical
scholar will tell you,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is not news,
that the book of Genesis

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
was never meant to be about
the origins of the world.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But many churchmen believed
that in the book of Genesis,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
you had actual sort
of live news like CNN

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
about the beginnings of
creation and therefore you

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
had many people down
through the ages,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
like the famous Archbishop
James Ussher in Ireland in 1650

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
who calculated all the ages
of the patriarchs back along

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and worked out to
his own satisfaction

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that the creation of the world
occurred in the year 4004

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
BC on the 17th of September
at 9 o'clock in the morning.

I don't think there's been
a good one until recently.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
To me, the only one
that makes sense

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
is that proto-consciousness,
platonic values, goodness,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
truth exist at this fundamental
level of spacetime geometry

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
which can influence our
actions if we're open to them

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and interconnect us
to all other beings,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.082 align:middle line:90%

>> Science creates the
stories that we live by.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And science has told
us a very bleak story.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It's told us that we're some
sort of genetic mistake,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have genes
that use us, basically,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
to move on to the
next generation

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and that we randomly mutate.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:84%
It's said that we are
outside of our universe,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are alone,
that we are separate

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the
sort of lonely mistake

And we're now realizing
that this view,

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
this view of separateness is one
of the most destructive things.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.924 align:middle line:84%

of observer-matter

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:84%
interrelationship which is
indeed making things real

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
for you, affecting how
you perceive reality.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not changing the
reality out there.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're not changing
big chairs and big trucks

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and bulldozers and
rockets taking off.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
You're not changing those, no.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But you're changing
how you perceive things

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and maybe how you
think about things,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
how you feel about things,
how you sense the world.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The infinite information that
the brain is processing every

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
single second tells us that
there's more to the world than

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:90%
we're perceiving.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
However, every single time
we're immersed in an experience

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
with our senses, seeing,
smelling, tasting,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.435 align:middle line:84%
feeling, as we're immersed
centrally in our reality.

00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We know nothing
about reality.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
All of our sense of
so-called reality out

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
there is filtered
through our sense organs.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The brain processes 400
billion bits of information

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:10%
a second, but we're only
aware of 2,000 of those.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
That means that reality
is happening in the brain

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:48.985 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> You should try it.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:90%
How do I know what I'm doing?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I and the vase are one.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.791 align:middle line:84%
Hey, it might help
your work, too.

00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:03.087 align:middle line:90%
>> I live through my eyes.

00:11:03.087 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I feel in reality.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Not just some
nebulous, nothing,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
touchy-feely world of
shifting whatevers?

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's real,
I want to see it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The eyes are, in some
senses, a camcorder.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Because they are taking
that information and they're

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:90%
storing it.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
really able to get

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:84%
it to mean anything until you
actually put it all together.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.977 align:middle line:84%
So in some senses, it
requires the editor's table

00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to really put the
whole thing together

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to put the movie together of
what your life and your world

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:90%
is actually about.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If I get out of bed
in the morning, OK,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and I suddenly decide to take
very seriously the claim,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
which is surely a true claim,
that I don't know for sure

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
if my eyes are
working correctly, OK,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
so that for all I know, even
though it looks like there is

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
a stable floor by
the side of my bed,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
there might be a cliff or
something like that, OK?

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
If I am unable to order
those possibilities in terms

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.958 align:middle line:84%
of probabilities that
I assign to them,

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
then I'm not going
to get out of bed.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me I'm paralyzed
in the most literal sense

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:90%
of the word, OK?

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have no idea how
to literally take the next step.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely the
case that we know

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that my eyes might, in
principle, be deceiving me

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:90%
at any moment.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:84%
We've had experience of
people before subject

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to hallucinations.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And even if we
didn't, we don't know

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
how to prove, as a
fundamental matter,

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:90%
that our eyes never deceive us.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely right.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we make the decision to
get out of bed in the morning,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
we are assigning probabilities
to the various hypotheses

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
compatible with my seeing
a floor by the bed.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
One hypothesis is there
really is a floor there

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I'm seeing it.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Another hypothesis is my seeing
the floor is a hallucination

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cliff there.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
By getting out of
bed in the morning

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
you endorse one of those
hypotheses as more likely

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
than another.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:90%
[SCREAMS]

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, ultimate
reality, I think,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
very frequently depends a lot
on how a person perceives it

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and what they actually think is
the real reality of our world.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> If the brain is processing
400 billion bits of information

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and our awareness
is only on 2000,

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that means reality is happening
in the brain all the time.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It's receiving that
information, and yet we

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:90%
haven't integrated it.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But if we're given knowledge
and information outside

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
of convention, outside the box
of convention, where, say, we

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
merge quantum physics and
neurophysiology and the brain

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
is asked to contemplate or
we're asked to contemplate on it

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and examine the what ifs and
possibilities and potentials

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and associate our knowns with
our experience of what we know

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and repeat it over and
over again, the brain

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to start to integrate
two independent neural nets

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
create a new vision.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And that new vision is going
to be like taking a flashlight

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and shining it from those
2000 bits of information that

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
have to do with our body
and our environment in time,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
slightly over in the dark
and looking at something new.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%
That's called realization.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:43.205 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>> You OK?

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I heard you scream earlier.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Was it another dream?

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:52.235 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You were an Indian watching
Columbus's ship materialize out

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.838 align:middle line:90%
of thin air.

00:14:58.838 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And this medicine
man kept hitting you.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.182 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:15:07.182 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Hey, maybe it was a past
life or a parallel reality

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:90%
or a future life.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Get real.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Or maybe that dream was
trying to tell you the truth.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I guess it just depends
on what you think is real.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should try
different anxiety pills.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> My pills are fine, OK?

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.855 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:35.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have
to go get dressed.

00:15:35.575 --> 00:15:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I hope you feel better, Amanda.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:50.386 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:53.865 align:middle line:84%
>> God, Amanda, you
can be such an asshole.

00:15:53.865 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>> People ask me, why does
quantum mechanics matter,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.315 align:middle line:84%
given that it's little,
tiny stuff and who cares?

00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
There are three
possible answers.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:84%
From a practical point of view,
it doesn't make any difference

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.272 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you still have to go
to work and drive your car

00:16:18.272 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and do all the rest of it.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
From a second point
of view, actually, it

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
infiltrates everything in the
world, especially the world

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.857 align:middle line:90%
of electronics.

00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the
supermarket and you

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
do the scanning at
the checkout, that's

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:90%
a quantum mechanical effect.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:10%
But I think the
important part is

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:10%
the third one,
which is essentially

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:10%
a philosophical issue.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Why are philosophers
so passionate

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
about deconstruction the
assumptions of the world?

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I finally got it.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I got it as a result of
looking at quantum mechanics

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and comparing it to
classical mechanics.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They present two very different
ways of thinking about the way

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that the world works
and about what we are.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So from a classical
perspective, we are machines.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And a machine, there is no room
for a conscious experience.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if a machine dies.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:90%
You can kill a machine.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.474 align:middle line:90%
You can throw it in a dump.

00:17:10.474 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:84%
If that is the way
that the world is,

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.125 align:middle line:84%
then people will
behave in that way.

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's another way of
thinking about the world which

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
is suggested, it's pointed to
by quantum mechanics, which

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
suggested that the world is
not this clockwork thing,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:90%
but it's more like an organism.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a highly interconnected
organismic thing of some type

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
which extends through
space and time.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
In that kind of
environment, what I think

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and the way that I behave
has a much greater impact,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:84%
not only on myself,
but on the rest

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of the world, than it would
if it was a classical world.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So from a very
basic point of view

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
having to do with morals
and ethics, what I think

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.355 align:middle line:90%
affects the world.

00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a sense,
that's really

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
the key for why a worldview
change is important.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
the subatomic world.

00:18:01.788 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk about what
it's telling us about reality.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I want to tell
you about the subatomic world

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
is it's totally
a fantasy created

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
by mad physicists
trying to figure out

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
what the heck is
going on when they

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:90%
do these little experiments.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
By little experiments,
I mean big energy

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
in little spaces in
little pieces of time.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It gets pretty nutty at
that realm of things.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And so subatomic
physics was invented

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:90%
to try to figure that all out.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We need a new
science down there.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:90%
It's called quantum physics.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And it is subject to a whole
range of debatable hypotheses,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, feelings, intuitions
as to what the heck is really

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So on the one hand,
you had a theory which,

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
from the conceptual standpoint,
was profoundly puzzling

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and on the other hand, from
a practical standpoint,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
was vastly more successful
than anything we had ever seen

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
This was the kind of situation
that produces the tension

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
investigations of foundations

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanics are
feeding off of since then.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, this is an acutely

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:84%
paradoxical, puzzling,
conceptually confusing theory.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
we have no option

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of throwing
it out or neglecting it

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.570 align:middle line:84%
because it is the most powerful,
proven tool for predicting

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the behaviors of
physical systems

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.367 align:middle line:84%
that we have ever
had in our hands.

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The universe is very strange.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
There seem to be two sets of
laws that govern the universe.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
In our everyday,
classical world,

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning at roughly our
size and timescales,

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.330 align:middle line:84%
things are described by
Newton's laws of motion,

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
set down hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And they worked very well
for billiard balls and cannon

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:90%
balls and gravity.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
However, when we get
down to a small scale,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
when we get down to,
say, the level of atoms,

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
a different set
of laws take over.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
These are the quantum
laws, quantum theory,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%
quantum mechanics.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And at that level, particles
may be in multiple places

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:10%
They may behave as waves smeared
out spatially and temporally.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:10%
They may be interconnected
over great distances.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:10%
They may be unified
into one quantum state,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:10%
into one state governed
by one wave function.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And the borderline,
the threshold,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
this curtain between the quantum
world and the classical world

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:90%
is really mysterious.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's called, sometimes, the
collapse of the wave function.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Because in the quantum
world, everything

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.983 align:middle line:84%
is in superposition of
multiple possibilities.

00:20:36.983 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
In the classical world,
these multiple possibilities

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
seem to collapse to
particular definite choices

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
so everything is in
one particular place.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum mechanics is
really the play and display

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of information, the play
and display of potentiality,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
waves of information, waves
of potential electron.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's important,
the word potential.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the
world of electrons,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
it's the world of
potential electrons.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But you have to ask the
question, waves of what,

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.470 align:middle line:90%
really?

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
What is the field
that is waving?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Is it the ocean?

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal ocean, an
ocean of pure potentiality,

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
an ocean of abstract
potential existence.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We call it the unified
field or super string field.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're made out of.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Connectivity,
among all things,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is a basic constituent
of the fabric of reality.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
wrap your mind around that.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But Erwin Schrodinger said, he's
one of the founders of quantum

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, that
entanglement, which

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is this idea of
this connectivity,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
is not just a property
of quantum mechanics,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:90%
it's the property.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the property of quantum
mechanics that makes it

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:90%
very, very strange.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't seem to fit
in with our ordinary world

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:90%
or ordinary experience.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, it actually does.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:13.184 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.184 --> 00:22:15.168 align:middle line:90%
>> You want to shoot some hoops?

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:20.624 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.624 --> 00:22:23.611 align:middle line:84%
Man, you don't have
to be like that.

00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Come on and play.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.497 align:middle line:90%
Look, he likes you.

00:22:27.497 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Don't you have time for
a little one on one?

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.797 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.797 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
How long has it been
since you played?

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Come on, you got the ball.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Take a shot.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, milady,
not from there.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It's out of bounds.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You gotta be on the
court to be in play.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.162 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Duke Reginald's
court of unending possibilities.

00:23:05.162 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Court rules.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Gotta sink the last one.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.342 align:middle line:90%
>> That hurt.

00:23:38.342 --> 00:23:40.252 align:middle line:90%
>> It never touched you.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's not solid.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:90%
This ball is mostly empty.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We were all taught in
school that the world is made

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:84%
of stuff, of matter,
of mass, of atoms.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Atoms make up molecules,
molecules make up materials,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and everything is made of that.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But atoms actually
are mostly empty.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, if this
ball were the nucleus

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of an atom, a proton in a
hydrogen atom, for example,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
then the electron
circling this which

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
would describe the outer
limits of that atom

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
would be out by that
mountain over there

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
roughly 20 miles away.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
between is empty.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the universe
is mostly empty.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
However, when we go down
in scale in the emptiness,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
we eventually come to a
level, the fundamental level

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime geometry, the fine
basement level of the universe

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
where there's information,
there's a pattern.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Planck scale.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's the fabric
of the universe.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And at that level,
there's information that's

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:90%
been there since the Big Bang.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So most of the universe, even
of matter, is actually empty.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people think
that the vacuum is empty.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But for internal
self-consistency

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanics
and relativity theory,

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.830 align:middle line:84%
there is required to
be the equivalent of 10

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:13.245 align:middle line:84%
to the 94 grams of mass
energy, each gram being E

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
equals MC squared
kind of energy.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.374 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a huge number, but
what does it mean practically?

00:25:19.374 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Practically, if I can assume
that the universe is flat,

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and more and more
astronomical data is showing

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty darn flat,
if I can assume that,

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
then if I take the
volume or take the vacuum

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
within a single hydrogen
atom that's about 10

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to the minus 23
cubic centimeters.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
If I take that amount of vacuum
and I take the latent energy

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
in that, there is a
trillion times more energy

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
there than in all of the
mass of all of the stars

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.333 align:middle line:84%
and all of the planets out
to 20 billion light-years.

00:25:57.333 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And if consciousness
allows you to control

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
even a small fraction of
that, creating a big bang

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
is no problem.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%

And what time reversal
symmetry means

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
is that a set of laws which

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the late
1970s, a neurophysiologist

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:84%
at University of
California San Francisco

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:84%
named Ben Libet did some
very famous experiments.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
What Libet did was
to study patients

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:84%
who were having
neurosurgery on their brains

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.013 align:middle line:84%
with their brains exposed
while they were awake.

00:31:29.013 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
They were given a
local anesthetic

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to numb the area of
the skull and scalp

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
to access their brains
and they were awake

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and Ben would talk
to these people.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
what he did was he

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:84%
would stimulate
their little finger

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and look at the part
of the sensory cortex

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite side
that was related to that,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:84%
record from it electrically,
and ask the patient

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.135 align:middle line:84%
when he or she felt the
stimulus on the little finger.

00:31:52.135 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And he would also stimulate at
that particular area of cortex.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.713 align:middle line:84%
Now what you would
think would be

00:31:57.713 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that if you stimulate
the little finger,

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
it takes a finite
period of time to get

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to the opposite
side of the cortex

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
so the patient would report
it a fraction of a second

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:84%
later, after the stimulus and
when you stimulate it directly,

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.560 align:middle line:84%
the patient would
report it immediately.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:90%
He found just the opposite.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:84%
When you stimulate
the little finger,

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:90%
the patient felt it immediately.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And when he stimulated
directly on the cortex,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.763 align:middle line:90%
there was a delay.

00:32:20.763 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
After sorting
through all the data

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.045 align:middle line:84%
and repeating this
over and over,

00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Libet came to the conclusion
that somehow the brain

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%
was projecting information
backwards in time

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.060 align:middle line:84%
so that it did take a
finite amount of time

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:84%
to get to the sensory cortex
but the brain projected it

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.730 align:middle line:84%
backwards in time so that
the conscious perception was

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.613 align:middle line:84%
that the stimulus was felt when
the pinch actually occurred.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:90%
each and every time you look.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
>> And here we are, the
granddaddy of all quantum

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:84%
weirdness, the infamous
double slit experiment.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
To understand this
experiment, we first

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
need to see how particles or
little balls of matter can.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.550 align:middle line:84%
If we randomly shoot
a small object, say,

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:84%
a marble, at the screen, we
see a pattern on the back wall

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
where they went through
the slit and hit.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we add a
second slit, we would

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
expect to see a second band
duplicated to the right.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's look at waves.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The wave hit the
slit and radiate out,

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:84%
striking the back wall
with the most intensity

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:90%
directly in line with the slit.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:84%
The line of brightness
on the back screen

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:90%
shows that intensity.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to the
line the marbles make.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But when we add the second slit,
something different happens.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
If the top of one wave meets
the bottom of another wave,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:90%
they cancel each other out.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So now there is an interference
pattern on the back wall.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Places where the two tops meet
are the highest intensity,

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:90%
the bright lines.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And where they cancel,
there is nothing.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we throw things, that
is matter, through two slits,

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
we get this--

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.600 align:middle line:90%
two bands of hits.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And with waves, we get
an interference pattern

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:90%
of many bands.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Good so far.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go quantum.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:90%


00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:10.680 align:middle line:84%
An electron is a tiny, tiny bit
of matter, like a tiny marble.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:10%
Let's fire a stream
through one slit.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.060 align:middle line:84%
It behaves just like the
marble, a single band.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So if we shoot these tiny
bits through two slits,

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:84%
we should get, like
the marbles, two bands.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:90%
An interference pattern.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:84%
We fired electrons, tiny
bits of matter through,

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.740 align:middle line:84%
but we get a pattern like
waves, not like little marbles.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:84%
How could pieces of matter
create an interference pattern

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:90%
like a wave?

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:51.230 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:90%
But physicists are clever.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.650 align:middle line:84%
They thought, maybe
those little balls

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.430 align:middle line:84%
are bouncing off each other
and creating that pattern.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So they decide to shoot
electrons through one

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:84%
There is no way they could
interfere with each other.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But after an hour of this,
the same interference pattern

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:90%
is seen to emerge.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:90%
The conclusion is inescapable.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
The single electron
leaves as a particle,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
becomes a wave of potentials,
goes through both slits,

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and interferes with itself to
hit the wall like a particle.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But mathematically,
it's even stranger.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It goes through both slits
and it goes through neither.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through just one and
it goes through just the other.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:84%
All of these possibilities
are in superposition

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.440 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But physicists were
completely baffled by this,

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.350 align:middle line:84%
so they decided to
peek and see which

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:90%
slit it actually goes through.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:84%
They put a measuring
device by one slit

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to see which one it went
through and let it fly.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum world
is far more mysterious

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:90%
than they could have imagined.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.350 align:middle line:84%
When they observed,
the electron went back

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to behaving like
a little marble.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It produced a pattern of two
bands, not an interference

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:90%
pattern of many.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The very act of
measuring or observing

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
which split it went
through meant it only

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:90%
went through one, not both.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:84%
The electron decided to act
differently as though it

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:90%
was aware it was being watched.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was here that
physicists stepped forever

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.601 align:middle line:84%
into the strange neverworld
of quantum events.

00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:90%
What is matter?

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Marbles or waves?

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And waves of what?

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And what does an observer
have to do with any of this?

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The observer collapsed the wave
function simply by observing.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We are always the observer,
but sometimes we identify with

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.370 align:middle line:84%
the event so much so that
we even lose the aspect

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.750 align:middle line:90%
of the observer.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.208 align:middle line:84%
That's why the materialist
gets totally lost

00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and thinks that we could
do without the observer.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The physics data tells us
that an object itself is really

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.640 align:middle line:84%
a simplification for
what we call out there.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
One is particularly
when we're looking

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:84%
at atomic and
subatomic particles

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
or atomic and subatomic
matter in any form, what

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:84%
we find is how we
go to look at it

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and what we choose to
examine it with actually

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
changes the properties of what
we observe to be out there.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this the observer which
is so intricate to understanding

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:15.210 align:middle line:84%
the wacky, weird world of
quantum particles and how they

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:90%
react?

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Is this, then, the observer?

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And even though we cannot
have a quantum field without

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
the observation of scientists
who have gone there who have

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
uncovered it layer
after layer after layer,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.550 align:middle line:90%
they're all observers.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But not one of them
agree conclusively

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
on all points in the
field because they

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:84%
are perceiving the
field mathematically

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
from different
angles of perception.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't know in quantum
mechanics how to hook ourselves

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.880 align:middle line:90%
as observers up with the world.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
to treat ourselves

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.060 align:middle line:84%
as observers, as just another
part of the physical system

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.387 align:middle line:90%
that we're describing.

00:41:07.387 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:84%
The only way we know how to
do quantum mechanics as it's

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:84%
traditionally
formulated is to keep

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
the observer outside of the
system you're describing.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The minute you put him in,
you get all these paradoxes

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're forced to say
things in quantum mechanics

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.910 align:middle line:84%
like, look, the book is
doing what it's doing

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:90%
because of quantum mechanics.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And I see that because
I'm there and I see it.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And you better not try to
analyze that second part

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of the sentence in
terms of applying

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.890 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics to it because
it's going to break down.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why there are these two
separate laws of the evolutions

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.222 align:middle line:84%
of physical systems,
one that applies

00:41:40.222 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
when you're not looking
at them, the other that

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:90%
applies when you are.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.190 align:middle line:90%
But that's crazy.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no way that we're
ever going to mathematize

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:84%
or put into a mathematical
formula this very act in which

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.270 align:middle line:84%
a conscious observer
comes up with the answer.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, the measuring
instruments, the recorder

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.360 align:middle line:84%
records it and there it is,
it's on the tape, it's recorded.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
You forgot one part
of the equation,

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:84%
somebody has to
look at the tape.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And until somebody
looks at the tape,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.710 align:middle line:90%
it ain't recorded it at all.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are not looking,
there are waves of possibility.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.830 align:middle line:84%
When we are looking, then there
are particles of experience.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> A particle, which we
think of as a solid thing,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:84%
really exists in a
so-called superposition,

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:84%
a spread out wave of
possible locations,

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's an all
of those at once.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The instant you check on
it, it snaps into just one

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.710 align:middle line:90%
of those possible positions.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It's easy to generate
situations where the equations

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:42.250 align:middle line:84%
of motion will predict that,
say, the wave function,

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the psi of a certain basketball,
is uniformly distributed all

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.290 align:middle line:90%
over the basketball.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any idea
what a state like that

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:90%
would look like.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.820 align:middle line:84%
According to the law
of quantum mechanics,

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:84%
that's supposed to be a
state in which it fails

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:84%
to make any sense even
to ask the question,

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.920 align:middle line:90%
where is the basketball?

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.440 align:middle line:84%
That is, according to the
law of quantum mechanics,

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.380 align:middle line:84%
asking the question where
is a basketball whose

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:84%
psi is uniformly distributed
over a whole basketball court

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
is the logical
equivalent of asking

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:84%
about, say, the marital
status of the number five, OK?

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you
don't know the answer,

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
you don't happen to know
whether the number 5 is married

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.990 align:middle line:84%
or a bachelor, it's that
the question somehow

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is radically inappropriate
in the first place.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The number 5 doesn't
have a marital status.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
there to ask about.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, a basketball
whose wave function

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
is uniformly distributed over
the entire basketball court

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.180 align:middle line:84%
would not have a position
that could even coherently

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:90%
be asked about.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the crux of the
measurement problem

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is precisely that, although the
Schrodinger equation predicts

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.260 align:middle line:84%
under certain circumstances,
circumstances which

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.430 align:middle line:84%
we basically know how to
reproduce in a laboratory,

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that basketballs should
go into states like that,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.100 align:middle line:84%
states where there fails to
be any intelligible facts,

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:84%
any sensible question,
even, about where they are.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when we go look at the
basketball court in situations

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:21.060 align:middle line:84%
like that, we invariably see
either a basketball over here

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:84%
or a basketball over there
or a basketball over there.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
see the basketball

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in some specific location
as opposed to seeing it

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in some science fiction
state that we can't even

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.500 align:middle line:84%
imagine what it looks
like where there fails

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to be a question about what
its location is, the fact

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that we always see it in
some definite location

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is an explicit violation of
these equations of motion.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly there that the
measurement problem comes up.

They are entangled.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And since everything was
entangled at the moment

oh, great here's this
nice blob of colored light

What I was speaking about in
the film is post-detection.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, under normal
circumstances, a single object,

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:05.040 align:middle line:84%
once it has been detected,
is in just one position.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
states of matter

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that have been created
now in which objects

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.120 align:middle line:84%
can be in multiple
positions simultaneously,

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:21.810 align:middle line:84%
not just two, but actually
as many as 3,000 positions.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:25.610 align:middle line:84%
The first of these
objects were called

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Bose-Einstein condensates.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are single
wave functions,

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:34.810 align:middle line:84%
meaning they are
single particles.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.460 align:middle line:84%
But even though they're
a single wave function,

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.967 align:middle line:84%
the wave function has
multiple positions.

00:48:40.967 --> 00:48:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll look, look, look,
right in the chamber, you know,

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:44.390 align:middle line:90%
you can see it right there.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see two things there.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:48.320 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, that's not two
things, that's one thing.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
in two places.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.260 align:middle line:84%
The tricky point here is
that it's still a single wave

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.440 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not 3,000 separate
wave functions,

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.590 align:middle line:90%
it's one wave function.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.015 align:middle line:90%

>> We took two simple
black boxes like this.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.220 align:middle line:10%
Inside is a very
simple electric circuit

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.120 align:middle line:10%
with a few diodes,
an oscillator, EPROM,

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.250 align:middle line:10%
some resistors and capacitors.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Basically, that's it.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.710 align:middle line:84%
We wrapped one in
aluminum foil, we

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:24.800 align:middle line:84%
put it in an electrically
grounded Faraday cage.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.800 align:middle line:84%
The other we set on a
tabletop around which four,

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.010 align:middle line:84%
very well qualified
meditators, highly inner self

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:90%
managed individuals sit.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And they go into a
deep meditative state.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.310 align:middle line:90%
They cleanse the environment.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.740 align:middle line:84%
They make it, essentially,
a sacred space

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.430 align:middle line:84%
using their mind
cleansing procedures

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and their intentions.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the four
speaks the specific intention

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:52.410 align:middle line:90%
for this device.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:56.601 align:middle line:84%
The intention is to influence
a particular target experiment.

00:52:56.601 --> 00:53:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It might be to increase the
pH of the purified water

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:06.180 align:middle line:84%
by one full pH or to decrease
the pH by one full pH unit.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.940 align:middle line:84%
We've used these devices
on all those experiments

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and have been
robustly successful.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:84%
In the meditative
process, then after one

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:17.190 align:middle line:84%
speaks the particular
intention, it's

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:22.290 align:middle line:84%
held various ways by the
four for maybe 15 minutes.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And then so be it, it's let go.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And then a subsidiary
intention is

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.740 align:middle line:84%
stated to seal that
imprint into the device.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:37.060 align:middle line:84%
We take one of these devices
with its aluminum foil,

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.770 align:middle line:90%
we put it in a soft package.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.660 align:middle line:90%
We put in a FedEx packet.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:84%
We ship it 2,000 miles
away to the laboratory

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.330 align:middle line:90%
we're using up in Minnesota.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And soon as it arrives there it
goes into its own electrically

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.460 align:middle line:90%
grounded Faraday cage.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.060 align:middle line:84%
The next day we do the
same with the control.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The experiment is running,
and basically then one

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.170 align:middle line:84%
just takes the
device out, sets it

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:84%
beside the experiment
within 6 inches to a foot,

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and turns it on for a
period time, that's it.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, we learned over
some period of time

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.720 align:middle line:90%
that there was another factor.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We found that the use of
these, we call them intention

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.580 align:middle line:84%
imprinted electrical
devices, the continued use

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of this somehow
conditions the space

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to some higher
level of symmetry.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And we start getting
new phenomena,

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that is, the devices work.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.660 align:middle line:84%
That is, the pH which
is normal starts

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.500 align:middle line:84%
rising one full pH if
that was the imprint,

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.990 align:middle line:90%
or it starts dropping.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
If you go one full pH unit
or beyond, you're dead.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.710 align:middle line:84%

can ask a single question,

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:31.720 align:middle line:84%
did it matter that people were
trying to push it towards ones

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.970 align:middle line:90%
or push it towards zeros?

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And the overall answer
is, yes, it does matter,

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that somehow intention is
correlated with the operation,

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:44.080 align:middle line:84%
with the output of these
random number generators,

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.870 align:middle line:84%
such that if you
wish for more ones,

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.520 align:middle line:84%

produce more ones.

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:90%
unfolding.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.550 align:middle line:84%

that there must

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:84%
be a lot of intention
going on at the time

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.440 align:middle line:84%
when the courtroom
drama is strong.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.990 align:middle line:84%

track of the courtroom drama.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But then Radin found that
whenever the intentions were

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.960 align:middle line:84%
strong in the
courtroom, that's when

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.230 align:middle line:84%

So they converted it,
instead of having a computer

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.220 align:middle line:84%
with a visual screen, they had
a computerized situation that

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%
was audiotapes.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.040 align:middle line:84%

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And they already played
this with nobody listening

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:19.300 align:middle line:90%
to it so that it already ran.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
They put that in a
vault and they then

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
gave the tape, the already
run tape to a participant

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.030 align:middle line:90%

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I want you to listen to it.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.375 align:middle line:84%

one in the vault, too.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that they
were both the same and they

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
both had more left
clicks than right clicks.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.230 align:middle line:90%

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't as though the
person who was the participant

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
had actually affected it at the
moment he was listening to it.

places are absolutely in space,

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
they're separate, and
never the twain shall meet.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:31.070 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, it's not true.

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
At some deeper level that
we can't see with our eyes

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
very clearly, two places
in space are the same.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.210 align:middle line:90%
They're co-located, coexisting.

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So if we imagine
that common sense,

01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
the way common sense
literally meaning

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
what your senses tell
you about the world,

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
if that's the way the world
is actually constructed,

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
then things like psychic
and mystical experience

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.090 align:middle line:90%
don't make any sense at all.

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole point about
psychic and mystical experience

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.625 align:middle line:84%
that makes them
strange is the sense

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that there's some kind of
connection between what's

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
going on inside
your head and things

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
elsewhere, elsewhere
in space and in time.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So what this view of
quantum mechanics provides

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is a way of framing what these
strange experiences are like.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And it reframes it from
somehow, magically, information

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is getting inside my head
from signals or forces

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
or something into
a different view,

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
which is that, in a sense,
your head, yes, is here,

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's also spread out, spread
out through space and time.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm able to
get a telepathic impression

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
from somebody at
a distance, it's

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:40.020 align:middle line:84%
not because I somehow
jumped out there and got it,

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:44.480 align:middle line:84%
but because at some deep level,
my head and the other person's

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.707 align:middle line:90%
head are co-located.

01:11:46.707 --> 01:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We become entangled all
the time when you communicate

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.030 align:middle line:90%
telepathically.

01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Those experiences
are so striking.

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I literally can
read your thoughts

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.620 align:middle line:90%
if I become entangled with you.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And such things happen,
there are distant viewing

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.520 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.130 align:middle line:84%
There are even
experiments now that you

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
are seeing light flashes, that
your brain potential picks up

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the signature of those
light flashes, what

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.230 align:middle line:84%
is called evoked
potential, that can

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
be measured in an EEG machine
connected to your brain.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And I am sitting over
there no light flashes,

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I cannot see you, and
still my brain potentials,

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
because I am correlated with
you in terms of intention,

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I intend to be directly
communicated with

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
your experiences, that
intention produces me,

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
gives me the capability
of simultaneously having

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.430 align:middle line:84%
the similar brain
potential in my brain.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.310 align:middle line:84%

by Jacobo Grinberg

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Mexico, and now

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
repeated by Peter
Fenwick in London.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.159 align:middle line:90%


01:12:49.159 --> 01:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%

be the sunrise.

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:54.840 align:middle line:84%

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I wake up in the morning
and I consciously create my day

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.460 align:middle line:90%
the way I want it to happen.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes because my mind
is examining all the things

01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that I need to get done,
it takes me a little bit

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to settle down and get to the
point of where I'm actually

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
intentionally creating my day.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing,
when I create my day

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and, out of nowhere,
little things happen

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that are so
unexplainable, I know

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that they are the process or
the result of my creation.

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more I do
that, the more I

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
build a neural net
in my brain that I

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:44.820 align:middle line:90%
accept that that's possible.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It gives me the power
and the incentive

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to do it the next day.

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And we all create
our own realities.

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And we do that because
we are the observer.

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
We are each the own
observer of our own reality.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And each of our
individual consciousnesses

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
creates our own
individual reality

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.100 align:middle line:90%
in the most amazing way.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.040 align:middle line:84%
My son, Evan, the
physicist says, no, it's

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.030 align:middle line:90%
an additive thing.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'm
holding one reality

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and someone else is
holding another reality.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the Super
Bowl this afternoon.

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reality that
the Eagles are holding

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is a different reality than
what the Patriots are holding.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And only one of
those realities are

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.870 align:middle line:90%
going to be the real reality.

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
additive and there

01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:31.110 align:middle line:90%
are interference patterns.

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think if we
keep quantum physics

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding very
simple for the layperson,

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that our observation has a
direct effect on our world,

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I think if we keep
it very simple,

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
then people can get about
the business of beginning

01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:49.740 align:middle line:84%
to practice the
skill of observation.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.680 align:middle line:84%
See, the subatomic world
responds to our observation,

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but the average person loses
their attention span every six

01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:57.900 align:middle line:90%
to 10 seconds per minute.

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't leave a lot of
room for our attention span.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So how can the
very large respond

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to someone who doesn't
have the ability

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.210 align:middle line:90%
to even focus and concentrate?

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we're just poor observers?

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we haven't mastered
the skill of observation.

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it is a skill.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're so addicted
to the external world

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and so addicted to the
stimulus and response

01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
of the external
world that the brain

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to
work out of response

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.930 align:middle line:90%
instead of out of creation.

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:30.600 align:middle line:84%
If we're given the
proper knowledge

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and the proper understanding and
given the proper instruction,

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
we should begin to see
measurable feedback

what it means for

and why we even have it.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
A simple way of defining it is
it has to do with awareness.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, it has to
do with awareness of the self.

That's at least how
we as human beings

But we have a long, long way to
grow before we get to the stage

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
where it is meaningful for
us to ask the question,

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
will we know God?

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:24.220 align:middle line:90%


01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people think of God as
that great figure in the sky

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
with the white beard who's
scrutinizing the human race

01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
from above.

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
They see us here on Earth as
in some form of neutral testing

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.660 align:middle line:84%
ground where we're placed
by God for a period

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and God watches from
above, registering

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
the scores on his laptop, as
to whether we perform according

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to his designs or whether we're
offending him, as it's put--

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.060 align:middle line:90%
an absolutely outrageous idea.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
How could we offend
God, the type of God

01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:03.550 align:middle line:90%
that people believe in?

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
How could it matter
so much to him?

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
How could it, above all,
matter that he would find it

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
so serious a situation
that he could condemn us

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:15.610 align:middle line:90%
to an eternity of suffering?

01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
These are bizarre ideas.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, they
have a great hold

01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
on the fears and the limitations
and the insecurities of people,

01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
which is why
religion can play so

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
effectively, whether
deliberately or otherwise,

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.400 align:middle line:90%
on those insecurities.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
People fall into
line very readily

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
when they're threatened
by these cosmic sentences

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.990 align:middle line:90%
of everlasting punishment.

01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> How in the 10 commandments
could we have possibly created

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
a mind that could
transcend space and time?

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
No, we're too busy keeping
our emotions in check

01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
to ever dream of
infinite possibilities.

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that is the
ultimate conspiracy.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though a given person
may have long ago thrown off

01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the trappings of religion, they
still live in the religious

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.520 align:middle line:84%
mold and they
don't even know it.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.310 align:middle line:10%
But their whole conception
of how reality works

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:23.370 align:middle line:10%
is all something that has
been molded by religion.

01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So until you get that
out of your system,

01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
you can't ever make a go of
an evolutionary perspective.

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
with organized religions

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
is that there is this
sense of separateness,

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.857 align:middle line:84%
that it's only good
to be a Protestant

01:20:38.857 --> 01:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
or that people who are Catholics
are the only people who

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
know the way.

01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think now our current
understanding of quantum

01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
physics is this understanding
of complete unity

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and so that we have to
derive our spirituality

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.745 align:middle line:90%
from a sense of unity.

01:20:53.745 --> 01:20:57.310 align:middle line:90%


01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the basic
journey of spirituality,

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
when we ask the question why
am I feeling separate all

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%
the time.

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:09.160 align:middle line:90%


01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of God always
conjures up the idea of the old

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
guy with the white beard in
the cloud judging, observing,

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:21.010 align:middle line:84%
punishing, rewarding,
or giving commands.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Once you're on
that track, you're

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
totally off the path
of spiritual evolution

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.218 align:middle line:90%
and development.

01:21:27.218 --> 01:21:32.590 align:middle line:90%


01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
The great appeal
of all to people

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
who don't want to grow up
but want the great parent

01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
in the sky looking after them
is to ask Jesus to do it for me.

01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
If only I'd place
my trust in Jesus,

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
he will save me from my
sins and look after me

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.220 align:middle line:90%
and all will be well.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jesus cannot eat my lunch
for me and Jesus cannot be born

01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:59.020 align:middle line:84%
for me and neither
can Jesus save me.

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're talking
about in real terms

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is not being saved by any
one, god or otherwise,

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
personal evolution.

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:14.500 align:middle line:90%


01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The only reason that there
is an addiction to religion is

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:23.890 align:middle line:90%
some way out of a mistake.

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Does that diminish
the greatness of God?

01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
No, it actually opens
the corral and lets

01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:37.080 align:middle line:90%
God be eternal, absolute.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The law that is given
to us is the same laws

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
given to that of those
people on Sirius,

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
given to us by the
people in the rho's

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.320 align:middle line:90%
universe or the R-universe.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, your Hubble
telescope has finally

01:22:55.510 --> 01:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
seen galaxies of immeasurable
beauty that in our heart

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and in our mind,
we long to engage.

01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It's exciting to be beings of
greater mind or lesser mind.

01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Where does it end?

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Does it end?

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Does it end?

01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:20.040 align:middle line:90%


01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We do not want to
accept responsibility.

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We do not want to
accept our greatness.

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's very easy for
any system of thought,

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
religious or otherwise
that comes along,

01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to play on that,
to play on our insecurities,

01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to assure us all is well
we'll all be taken care of.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.190 align:middle line:90%
We lap that up.

01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Do not blame religion,
blame our own insecurities

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
which has allowed
religion to flourish

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and which has allowed so
many systems of thought

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that are disempowering
to flourish

01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:52.620 align:middle line:90%
throughout human history.

01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why we can't
get out of it.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:08.270 align:middle line:90%


01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I now present to you Mr. And
Mrs. Richard Buck Philipowski.

[MUSIC - MENDELSSOHN, "WEDDING

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:33.060 align:middle line:90%


01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Experiencing something in the
present day that is a trigger

01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
to something that is very
emotionally charged for us,

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
so now we have become even more
disconnected from the reality

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.370 align:middle line:90%
of what actually is.

01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:53.770 align:middle line:90%


01:24:53.770 --> 01:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> A dream, like a
thunderstorm in our brain,

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
in its electrical strikes
through our synaptic skies

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.320 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth of our being,
creates a chemical cascade

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
in our body that prepares
our body for conquest,

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:21.150 align:middle line:84%
achievement or relishing
experience emotionally.

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But we would have
no conquest, indeed,

01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
we would have no relishment
if we had not first

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
had that hologram and those
chemicals that made us--

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
or rather changed us from
being fearful entities

01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
into fearless entities
after a dream.

01:25:46.340 --> 01:26:01.460 align:middle line:90%


01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe is the crowning
achievement of the human brain,

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.090 align:middle line:90%
the frontal lobe.

01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:10.300 align:middle line:90%


01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
This frontal lobe allows
us a distinguishness

01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:18.500 align:middle line:90%
to change our minds.

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the workings
of the nervous system

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and the particular way that
it implements quantum effects,

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
very distinct specific way,
not general, not fuzzy,

01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:33.380 align:middle line:84%
not imprecise, that it
absolutely does open the door

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
for free will being a
possibility that does not

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
violate modern scientific
tenets and that's consistent,

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent, with
people's subjective impression

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.240 align:middle line:90%
that we do have free will.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What separates us from all
other species is the ratio

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.952 align:middle line:84%
of our frontal lobe to
the rest of the brain.

01:26:54.952 --> 01:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe is an
area of the brain that's

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:59.790 align:middle line:84%
responsible for firm
intention, for decision

01:26:59.790 --> 01:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
making, for regulating
behavior, for inspiration.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It is the seat of what
causes us to take information

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.460 align:middle line:84%
from our environment and process
it and store it in our brain

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.857 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions
or choices that

01:27:13.857 --> 01:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
are different than the
decisions and choices

01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:16.950 align:middle line:90%
that we've made in the past.

01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:20.100 align:middle line:90%


01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
The brain is made up of tiny
nerve cells called neurons.

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:25.410 align:middle line:84%
These neurons have
tiny branches that

01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
reach out and connect to other
neurons to form a neural net.

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Each place where they
connect is integrated

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.180 align:middle line:90%
into a thought or a memory.

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the brain builds
up all its concepts

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
by the law of
associate of memory,

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.470 align:middle line:84%
for example, ideas,
thoughts, and feelings

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:42.630 align:middle line:84%
are all constructed
and interconnected

01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in this neural net and all
have a possible relationship

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:46.950 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
The concept and the
feeling of love,

01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
for instance, is stored
in this vast neural net.

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But we build the
concept of love from

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.200 align:middle line:90%
many other different ideas.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people have love
connected to disappointment.

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
When they think about
love, they experience

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:04.320 align:middle line:84%
the memory of pain, sorrow,
anger, and even rage.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%

our synovial fluid?

01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:30.737 align:middle line:84%

become brittle and stiff.

has to do with our
personality, that

01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:47.240 align:middle line:84%
has to do with our
association to people,

our association to places, our
association to things and times

and events.

01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:56.690 align:middle line:84%

in our brain that
reaffirms our identity

01:59:59.830 --> 02:00:02.940 align:middle line:90%
and reaffirms our personality.

02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We now have science to back
up what our thoughts do and how

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.750 align:middle line:90%
they make our bodies weak.

A lot of scientists are

with behavioral
kinesiology and other ways,

02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:15.500 align:middle line:84%
showing that thoughts
make your body weak

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts pretty much
create your reality.

02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They create what you're going
to think about yourself.

If you're fat but you
think you're wonderful,

you'll be wonderful.

02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%

with impossible images
from Barbie to models.

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we think that our
whole currency is how we look

02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and how other people are
going to perceive us.

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're always up against
impossible standards.

02:00:42.050 --> 02:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> What is relative to their own
emotional addiction are movies

02:00:47.150 --> 02:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and dramas and news and all
the media that is so beautiful

02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
today and providing people
with experiences without having

02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
to be there.

02:00:57.930 --> 02:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet, and yet, that does
not define human greatness.

02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> They're so hypnotized by
their environment through

02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
the media, through television,
through people living

02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and creating ideals that
everybody struggles to become

02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that no one can actually become
in terms of physical appearance

02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and definitions of beauty and
valor that are all illusions

02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that most people surrender and
live their life in mediocracy.

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And they may live that life
and the soul may never really,

02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
their desire may never
really rise to the surface.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So they may want to
be something else.

02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But if it does
rise to the surface

02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and they ask themselves
if there is something more

02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:54.080 align:middle line:84%
or why am I here, what
is the purpose of life,

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
where am I going, what
happens when I die--

02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
they start to ask
those questions.

02:01:58.790 --> 02:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
They start to flirt and
interact with the perception

02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that they may be having
a nervous breakdown.

02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And in reality,
what they're doing

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
is that they're old concepts
of how they view their life

02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and the world start
to fall apart.

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%


02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why very few
people make this journey.

02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Because it's deeply unsettling.

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
All of the molds that we have
lived by have to be broken.

02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And we have to liberate
ourselves in this way.

02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there's
an awkward period

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
between the comfort
that we knew before

02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and the real state
of comfort when

02:02:50.770 --> 02:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
we are the lord of
our being, which

02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:56.130 align:middle line:90%
follows that interval of chaos.

02:02:56.130 --> 02:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when they
get into the chaos

02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
give up hope and go back to
the old, false securities.

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.615 align:middle line:84%
They get to live
a reasonable life.

02:03:06.615 --> 02:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And they get to die
in some sort of peace,

02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
but they haven't advanced
spiritually at all

02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in that experiment
that we called a life.

02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:56.780 align:middle line:90%

territory in our brain.

02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And because we're in
completely new territory,

02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
we're rewiring the
brain, literally

02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
reconnecting to a new
concept, then, ultimately,

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
it changes us from

02:04:15.110 --> 02:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%

will my life change?

02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I change?

What am I addicted to?

02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:25.730 align:middle line:84%
What will I lose that I'm
chemically attached to?

02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And what person, place,
thing, time, or event

that I'm chemically attached
to that I don't want

to lose because I may
have to experience

02:04:34.070 --> 02:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
the chemical
withdrawal from that?

02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:38.060 align:middle line:90%

02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

02:05:55.730 --> 02:05:58.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the problem that I
have with right and wrong

02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:01.950 align:middle line:10%
in those categories is not
that I want a free for all,

02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:06.650 align:middle line:10%
but that right and wrong
doesn't go nearly far enough.

02:06:06.650 --> 02:06:08.470 align:middle line:10%
>> They have never sinned.

02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:09.560 align:middle line:90%
They have never wronged.

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Wronged, yes, in moral
confrontations with society.

02:06:15.190 --> 02:06:17.030 align:middle line:90%
But that's their adversity.

02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're
here, to wrong,

02:06:19.930 --> 02:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
to learn, search, and
use the wisdom of that

02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
to create yet greater dreams.

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nobody
keeping records up there,

02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:31.883 align:middle line:90%
the records are here.

02:06:31.883 --> 02:06:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
to deal with them.

02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
That's far more
painful than a record

02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:38.890 align:middle line:90%
keeping God up in the skies.

02:06:38.890 --> 02:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who's setting out
on the path of enlightenment

02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
will be absolutely impeccable
in everything that they do.

02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of
fear of damnation?

02:06:48.730 --> 02:06:49.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Or of the punishment of God
or because I have sinned

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.130 align:middle line:90%
and haven't got forgiveness?

02:06:54.130 --> 02:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no,

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all
excuses that keeps us away

02:06:57.820 --> 02:06:59.710 align:middle line:90%
from the problem.

02:06:59.710 --> 02:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The really enlightened
person will

02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:06.850 align:middle line:84%
see every action has a reaction
with which I must deal.

02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I am wise,
I'm not going to do

02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
stuff that will cause me to
have to face it and resolve it

02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and balance in my soul later.

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the real criterion.

02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.927 align:middle line:84%
>> That God or the
fundamental level of reality,

02:07:18.927 --> 02:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
depending on what people
describe, really, I mean,

02:07:21.010 --> 02:07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, you
should be everywhere.

02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It's something exactly
how it would manifest

02:07:25.930 --> 02:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
or how god would
manifest in the world

02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:30.170 align:middle line:90%
is a more complicated issue.

02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
certainly, from a more

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
traditional religious
perspective,

02:07:34.090 --> 02:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
people have kind of gotten
away from God the person.

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a great shift
from God up there or out there

02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
or in there, wherever,
to the god within.

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's an improvement.

02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want
to get some idea

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that God can be within and
still be separate, which

02:07:52.570 --> 02:07:54.250 align:middle line:90%
is what most people think.

02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
They think the god
within is like some

02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of those alien movies, you know,
where some being breaks out

02:08:00.230 --> 02:08:01.030 align:middle line:90%
from my chest.

02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
God is not within in
that stupid sense.

02:08:04.930 --> 02:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that in God, we
live, move, and have our being,

02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that we are ourselves,
in fact, are divine.

02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the relation between
my god self and your god self?

02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There is no relationship because
there's only one god self.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.130 align:middle line:90%
It's in both of us.

02:08:21.130 --> 02:08:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> All people are divine people.

02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:25.200 align:middle line:90%


02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it not ironic
that all would say

02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that this is the voice of the
devil or that this is heresy?

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:40.930 align:middle line:84%
If this is heresy, then
what is promised to everyone

02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
is an imbuement with
God that is inseparable.

02:08:44.780 --> 02:09:00.620 align:middle line:90%


02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowledge allows the brain
to begin to become wired.

02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And we will begin to see
what has always existed.

02:09:09.170 --> 02:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But because we live in those
routine automatic programs

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or unable to see because
we're processing mind

02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
from the familiar, to
learn knowledge means

02:09:19.850 --> 02:09:21.920 align:middle line:90%
we're learning new things.

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And to learn new
things means we're

02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
gathering information and
creating the circuitry now

02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
to begin to develop
the sensitivity

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to begin to see things
for the first time.

02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:37.530 align:middle line:90%


02:09:37.530 --> 02:09:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> There is enormous potential
to change the kind of behaviors

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and characteristic patterns
that we've fallen into.

02:09:46.150 --> 02:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you've listened
and have remembered anything

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that I've said, your
physiology is different

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.680 align:middle line:90%
than it was before that.

02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
That is something that Eric
Kandel, the recent winner

02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Nobel Prize in
medicine of science,

02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
said very eloquently at a
talk, that, basically, memory

02:10:07.210 --> 02:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
has been encoded, your
genetic structure has changed.

02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And while we previously would
talk about the nervous system

02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
as this very rigid
thing that didn't

02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.890 align:middle line:84%
have much capacity
for change, we

02:10:20.890 --> 02:10:24.012 align:middle line:84%
now know that, on many
levels, that isn't true.

02:10:24.012 --> 02:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there's
a tremendous amount

02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
of plasticity, which basically
means ability to change,

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
within the nervous system.

02:10:31.610 --> 02:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you look at the
structure of the human brain

02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
in detail, you see that it's
actually specifically designed,

02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
it's carefully engineered to
experience the unified field,

02:10:41.290 --> 02:10:43.920 align:middle line:90%
to experience the unity of life.

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> We are all connected.

02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the most
fundamental thing is we're all

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.810 align:middle line:90%
connected by an energy field.

02:10:49.810 --> 02:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We swim in a sea of
light, basically,

02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
which is the zero point field.

02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I say, first
of all, you have

02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:58.967 align:middle line:84%
to get away from the whole
idea of separateness.

02:10:58.967 --> 02:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Because separateness is the
biggest problem in the world

02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:03.210 align:middle line:90%
now.

02:11:03.210 --> 02:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You take this notion of
an entangled universe and you

02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
apply it to human experience
because human experience is

02:11:09.630 --> 02:11:11.890 align:middle line:90%
part of the universe as well.

02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, let's assume
that experience is entangled,

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.640 align:middle line:90%
then how would it manifest?

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can start
going through ways

02:11:19.110 --> 02:11:20.610 align:middle line:90%
in which it could manifest.

02:11:20.610 --> 02:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection
with another mind,

02:11:22.890 --> 02:11:24.105 align:middle line:90%
we call it telepathy.

02:11:24.105 --> 02:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection to some
other object somewhere else,

02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:28.770 align:middle line:90%
we call it clairvoyance.

02:11:28.770 --> 02:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection that
happens to transcend time,

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:33.390 align:middle line:90%
we call it precognition.

02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:35.995 align:middle line:84%
If there's a connection in which
my intention is expressed out

02:11:35.995 --> 02:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
in the world some
way, we might call it

02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
psychokinesis or distant healing
or something of that sort.

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can go through
a list of perhaps 12

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
kinds of psychic experience
that have gotten labels

02:11:47.190 --> 02:11:49.632 align:middle line:90%
over the years, like telepathy.

02:11:49.632 --> 02:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But this is really just
the tip of the iceberg.

02:11:51.590 --> 02:11:54.430 align:middle line:90%


02:11:54.430 --> 02:11:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>> People ask why are you so
interested in the Planck scale,

02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the very ultimately tiny
in terms of spirituality.

02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously spirituality
is out there, it's everywhere.

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
that, yes, the Planck

02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
scale is ultimately small,
but it's also everywhere.

02:12:12.730 --> 02:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%
Wherever you go, there it is.

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
holographic and repeats

02:12:17.050 --> 02:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
at different scales
like fractals

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that what quantum
physics is to the 20th century,

02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
whatever is going to be
the new bridging of science

02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, that will
be to the 21st century.

02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We are all
creating the future.

02:12:34.630 --> 02:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
We are all creating
what is outside of us.

02:12:39.190 --> 02:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
None of us are innocent
in that regard.

02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
If there's something
out there we don't like,

02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
we can't really
turn our backs on it

02:12:51.690 --> 02:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
because we're co-creators
somehow or other.

02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do
the right things

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to try to get the future
that is best for all of us.

02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We have talked so far about
the freedom of our own personal

02:13:12.330 --> 02:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
life and quantum physics, that
we are freeing and freeing

02:13:17.130 --> 02:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and freeing our reality
to ultimate realities.

02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course, they exist.

02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But after we have
accomplished them, what then?

02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:26.480 align:middle line:90%
What next?

02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:29.550 align:middle line:90%


02:13:29.550 --> 02:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
When do we make the
shift from me to one?

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
When are we the
subconscious mind?

02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
When are we the knowledge of
the one transpersonal self?

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start to realize
what your true nature is,

02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
there is no question and
there is no answer anymore.

02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And there is just the
sudden realization.

02:13:53.650 --> 02:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Now you come back
from the rabbit hole

02:13:56.570 --> 02:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and you start to perform in this
world of illusion and wonder

02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and magic with
that understanding

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're never going to
die and you were never born.

02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%


02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Choice, by consciousness,
out of these possible events,

02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the actual event of
experience comes in.

02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And so for the first time,
science encounters free will.

02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%

>> I've heard some people
say that, you know,

02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:43.192 align:middle line:10%
consciousness is this wonderful
property in the universe that

02:23:43.192 --> 02:23:44.820 align:middle line:10%
has a predilection
for the human brain.

02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:47.700 align:middle line:10%
If that's the case,
then consciousness

02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:49.920 align:middle line:10%
is about three pounds
and looks a little bit

02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:51.940 align:middle line:10%
like a gray cauliflower.

02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:52.740 align:middle line:90%

02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:26.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I actually did this at a
conference when we asked people

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:29.430 align:middle line:10%
how many people have had a
gut feeling and so on, and 80%

02:24:29.430 --> 02:24:30.230 align:middle line:10%
of people say.

02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:31.938 align:middle line:10%
And then they say,
among those of you who

02:24:31.938 --> 02:24:35.630 align:middle line:10%
are very skeptical of
unconventional claims,

02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:39.032 align:middle line:10%
how many of you, meaning
like 30% of the audience who

02:24:39.032 --> 02:24:41.240 align:middle line:10%
doesn't believe in any of
this stuff, how many of you

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:43.460 align:middle line:10%
guys have had interesting
gut feelings that

02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:44.750 align:middle line:10%
turned out to be right?

02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:46.530 align:middle line:90%
80%.

02:24:46.530 --> 02:24:49.493 align:middle line:84%
So when people are skeptical
about unusual things,

02:24:49.493 --> 02:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
it's completely
understandable because there's

02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:53.400 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of nonsense out there.

02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you bring those
phenomena into the lab

02:24:55.850 --> 02:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and you exclude all of the
ordinary ways of understanding

02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
them, it turns out that they
do have a psychic component.

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:13.070 align:middle line:10%
That's always the
trick, isn't it?

02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:16.985 align:middle line:84%
>> You probably have
more to say about this.

02:25:16.985 --> 02:25:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:20.660 align:middle line:90%

02:25:38.490 --> 02:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I actually wanted to
become a physicist as young

02:25:40.970 --> 02:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
as the age of four,
believe it or not.

02:25:43.490 --> 02:25:47.990 align:middle line:10%
>> As we become more and
more inner self-managed,

02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:54.050 align:middle line:10%

of these deeper levels down

the rabbit hole.

02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:58.580 align:middle line:10%
And so we become a Qigong master

to look at all that,

02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:06.380 align:middle line:10%
it seems to me the only way out
that I can understand is there

02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:07.850 align:middle line:10%
is an intelligent presence.
