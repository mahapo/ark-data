I didn't connect with them.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I was crying.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked into this
grocery store, the all night,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:90%
very bright place.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And I put my glasses
on, of course.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm walking.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But you can tell
that I'm crying.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
feel a tap on my shoulder.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And I turn around.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
little Asian man.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at me.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:90%
And he puts his hands on me.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:90%
He says, it's OK.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
We do this together.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was such an
emotional state.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I just looked down for a moment
like this, and I said, yes.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, thank you.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to say something.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
But I-- and he was longed.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
For me, he was an angel
that really came at a time

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to just remind me that
the pressure wasn't on me,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:90%
but to just surrender, again.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.013 align:middle line:84%

beautiful moment.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:90%

People are so separate
and split off.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's
wanting connection.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people might say, I
want to connect with God.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people might say, I
want to connect with myself.

I want a connection

Some people might say, I
want to connect with ETs.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Then Mount Shasta
is like a doorway.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
No, Mount Shasta
is a place where

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
the veils, the separation
between dimensions of reality

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:90%
are thin.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's easier to experience
things in the spirit realm

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%
than other places.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%

or spiritual traditions.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And Mount Shasta just
amplifies the deepest truth

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%

that or interpret

that in the context of
whatever religion they have.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:90%
they might feel, wow.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I never felt this close to
Jesus Christ in my life.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:10%
If someone comes and they're
Hindu, they might say, wow.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I saw a vision of
Lord Shiva dancing.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So people just
experience the energy

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:84%

I don't know what color
it was when he arrived.

a natural hair color.

It was always some wild

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:90%
a fluorescent green.

He would hit Google before
people were even doing Google.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:10%
He would jump on
there and do YouTube

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:10%
before anybody
was doing YouTube.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Now everybody's doing it.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But back then, he would
just jump on and figure out

what's going on.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%

just dive into the computer.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And anything
computer-related, we said,

give it to Paul, man. (LAUGHS)
He's going to figure it out.

And I had all the songs.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%

We'd get done in the studio.

And then I'd go do his makeup.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%

he'd be up on stage

different color hair.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It was purple.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It was blue.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:90%

gave him a series

of teachings, which came
to be called the I Am

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%

teaching was find God here.

And ultimately, you
are one with God.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge phenomena.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere he
went, he talked

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
about meeting Saint
Germain on Mount Shasta.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So that really
began the reputation

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84%
that Mount Shasta was the
kind of place you could come

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and anything was possible.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
You could meet an
ascended master.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:90%
You can meet God.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And then in the 1960s, there
was a big spiritual awakening

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:90%
that happened in America.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And many young Americans,
the hippie seekers,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.602 align:middle line:84%
were going to India to find
a guru, to try to find God.

00:16:46.602 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
the word started

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to get out in San
Francisco, which was like,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:84%
the epicenter for the awakening,
that you don't have to go all

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:90%
the way to India to find God.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
You can find God
on Mount Shasta.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the 60s,
a lot of the hippies

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:90%
started to come to Mount Shasta.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And Mount Shasta at the time
was this very conservative,

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:90%
fundamentalist Christian town.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And at first, the local
people weren't sure

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
if they liked having all
these barefoot young people

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.236 align:middle line:90%
with long hair coming.

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
But right around then
was also the beginning

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.553 align:middle line:84%
of an environmental
protection in America.

00:17:19.553 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there started

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to be severe restrictions
on cutting down

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:90%
trees in national forests.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
National Forest here.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, the
whole economy was in danger.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And the local people
started to realize

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that becoming a spiritual
Mecca was a good thing.

I was in my apartment, in
Los Angeles, of course.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I got a call
from a second cousin.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And he asked, you know,
let's go somewhere.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's go-- It was
actually New Year's Eve.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.575 align:middle line:90%
>> (SHOUTING) Happy New Year.

00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:90%

Let's go.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I found the place that was
really close to the apartment I

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:90%
was in.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
OK, let's go here.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So we went there, just
about five-minutes drive.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And we got we got there.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:90%
There were so many people.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:90%
I had never been there before.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:90%
And we started to walk upstairs.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
There was an upstairs.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So we walked up there.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there was this girl.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And this girl wanted to take
my photo, my photograph.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And so right next to us, because
it was New Year's, there's

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
a very big like
a stuffed animal,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
or he's like a big kind
of, doll or something.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And so, OK.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And so the girl had the phone.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:90%
And we went back with him.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just leaned on
the wall, kind of,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:90%
the wall was right here.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, she took the photo.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.865 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of like just
leaned on the wall.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:10%
>> So Paul was at a New Year's
Eve party in Beverly Hills.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:90%
And they were carousing.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, when he
stepped back, he misstepped.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And he fell back and
hit a protruding outlet

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:90%
socket, electrical socket.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And he hit it in
exactly the wrong spot.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it was
loose, with its wires.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And it jolted him
and shocked him.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:10%
So somehow, it
internally exploded

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:10%
his kidney a little bit
and burst a few ribs

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:10%
from that particular fall.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The following morning
when he woke up,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't hardly move.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I just went like this.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything was tight.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
My legs were
straight and my arms.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't breathe.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
My cousin said, hey,
Paul, what happened?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I just-- something
hit me, I said.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
After maybe, I don't
know how much time,

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:90%
but he helped me to get up.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And we walked down the stairs.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
to hurt more.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I have to go.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.110 align:middle line:90%
I have to go home.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I got a car to take me home.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
That next morning, I woke up
in my bed in a pool of blood.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And it hurt so much.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The body, all of this
just started to hurt.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the bathroom
and everything was blood.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to the hospital.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I was in excruciating
pain the entire time.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I had no peace.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, none.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Not one second where
there wasn't pain.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Nothing-- they would give
me all of these things.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And you have all these wires.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.185 align:middle line:90%
And nothing would stop the pain.

00:21:42.185 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Like my father,
the end did come.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- all night,
I was just in utter pain.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And for him to see me that
way was really difficult.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
It really, really caused him
a lot of pain on himself.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And even he got
sick from being--

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:90%
seeing me like that.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Don would come.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And he would take me.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was moments where
I could barely walk there.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:90%
So he would carry me almost.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
In so much pain because
of so many things that

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
would be happening, side
effects from everything

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and more coming to the
surface, more pain,

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:90%
pain body different places.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I came to that moment where
I came to the crossroads.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%

from Venus, come

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to embody all and
fuel these things.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I felt was, OK,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.095 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
leave this body.

00:22:46.095 --> 00:22:47.310 align:middle line:90%

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So, a few years ago, back
when I was dating somebody,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we went for
the very first time.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And we went up on the mountain.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:90%
There was so much snow.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But I really felt the
calling to be there.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It really did feel like
home, which it probably

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
does for a lot of people.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%

to me called "Dweller on Two

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Planets."

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
complicated book.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a book that was
channeled in the 1800s

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
by a 16-year-old boy.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I went to a bookstore.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And that book it
truly just fell on me.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It was like a movie.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It was actually about
a very spiritual

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:90%
being called Philo, so Tibetan.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Philo's a Tibetan.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
He explains many lives that
he had in Atlantis, in heaven,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
being with different
people, different soulmates,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:90%
different twin flames.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
got to a chapter.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was-- it was
called Seven Shasta Scenes.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:10%
And it was a whole chapter
about the way the sun looks

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:10%
on the mountain, and the snow.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:10%
And the way the
sun in the morning

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:10%
looks, and different Shasta
scenes, streams and different

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:10%
places.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And so I just didn't
understand how they came out

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:10%
of nowhere in this story.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this process,
more and more books came.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And they all ended up
having the mountain.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about Mount Shasta.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.830 align:middle line:84%
This was God saying,
it's time now.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I felt that beyond anything.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I had
to get out of there.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I did pack my car, rolled down
my guitar through the stairs,

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.028 align:middle line:90%
and two backpacks.

00:26:28.028 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I brought.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I left everything else.

like the accident

freed something that was waiting
to get free before it happened.

>> I came knowing
the energy's here,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.167 align:middle line:90%
and what would happen here.

00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the
extent of what would

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.464 align:middle line:90%
happen here I had no idea.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
During the time that
I started coming

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to Mount Shasta, later on one
of those moments, I met Andrew.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And he took me to two
portals on the mountain

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that are well known
and very powerful.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was in Mount
Shasta for a long time

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
before I reached out
to him or anyone here.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I needed to do what
I had to do first.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go
through a surrender.

My healing process
here at Mount Shasta

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
was difficult, for
I was so disabled.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
There were days where I just
couldn't get out of bed,

for everything hurts so much.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
There were days where I
would walk on the mountain.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And all I could do is
five steps at a time.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And then sometimes I would fall.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And if I would fall that
would be really bad for me.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I did see physical therapy and
other doctors here, actually,

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
at some point just to
see pictures of things

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have any answers.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't say that I
would be cured in any way.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say that I would
be able to walk normally

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:90%
like I do now.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And I am.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:84%
All I knew that was
my kidney was healed.

my beautiful new kidney.

stop the fear, the judgments

of oneself or others.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a moment
when I was on a mountain.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was a cloudy day.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was with a friend.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And she was running
around the field.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
to take pictures.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Wherever she went the
violet flame was on her.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
And I had photos of those.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't even any sun.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And that really
was the first time

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that violet flame appeared
in a physical form.

through my embodiment,

Saint Germain helped me
to go through each fear,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:84%
each sadness, all of
them and alchemize them.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:90%
At a point, they were all gone.

Ascended masters are really
just like you and me.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They just choose to stay
at a certain frequency

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%

embodied on different planets,

separation, just as one.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I was meditating
on the mountain.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And this picture was taken
in, I believe may or June.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
while I'm up there,

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:90%
and I start to meditate.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I went in and it's a
very beautiful silence.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened
my eyes, I saw I

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:84%
was covered in snow kind
of, like, this much snow

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.470 align:middle line:90%
all around me.

I felt it's like, wow.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't supposed to
snow in summertime.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I got up.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I felt such a
multidimensional moment,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:84%
a complete omnipresent
in that moment

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:90%

And there was snow.

There was rain.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:90%
There was icicles.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:90%
There were streams of water.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
There were flowers,
flowers and snow.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.100 align:middle line:84%
These are two
dimensions meeting.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt as this was such
an omnipresent in that moment.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed in such joy.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But it continued
to rain and snow.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I just started to
take a few pictures,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.620 align:middle line:84%
because it was
just so beautiful.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see anything.

But I felt everything.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.820 align:middle line:84%
When I did get back, I
looked at the photos I took.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And right here in this corner
here, I saw Saint Germain.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can see him here, with
eyes, and his hair, and a face,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and a robe.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.200 align:middle line:90%
And his hands are like this.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:10%
And there's even
an energy field,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:10%
his aura all around him
like a violet energy field.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:10%
And you can see his
eyes and his skin.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you enlarge this, which
I do have a large copy of this,

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you really can see this ascended
master Saint Germain that

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:90%
completely materialized here.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the only
known photograph of him.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul had taken us
to the Temple of Love.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And we had just done
a guided meditation.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And after that experience,
everybody was taking pictures.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.545 align:middle line:84%
And he just told me,
Judy, go stand over there.

00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
standing by rocks.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, go farther.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Go farther back.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, OK, I'm
going to take your picture.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when he asked me to take
a picture, I just stood there.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hands
in Prayer Position.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And I just closed my eyes.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
closed my eyes, I

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:84%
started feeling this energy
like, come down into me.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:90%
It was very tangible.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.409 align:middle line:90%
It was a very warm.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
This warm energy like,
coming down into my body.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:90%
But I knew who that was.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was the energy
of Saint Germain.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So Saint Germain, his
love, his loving presence

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:90%
started to wash over my body.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:90%
And then in my--

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
here, my mind's eye, my
vision, I could see him kind of

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:90%
to the left and in front of me.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
talking to me.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It was just so beautiful
and super magical.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's an experience
I will never, ever, ever forget.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
And when Saint
Germain left, like,

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you could really feel him,
his energy starting to depart,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:84%
because then it feels so
hot inside of my body.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And I finally opened my eyes.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And Paul said he was
taking pictures of me

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, his camera
caught me in violet.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I was immersed in violet.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And here in my third eye, it was
golden, here in my third eye.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was truly a
magical experience.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And it really made me
feel super honored.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, originally when we saw
it on the website, we're like,

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:10%
that's not real.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:10%
But then when you see it
happen before your very eyes,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:10%
it is real.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:90%
But it was very interesting.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:90%
I was watching.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We were all gathered
at the stream.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And then Paul walked
out to the meadow.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And then one of our
participants went out.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And I saw Paul
taking your picture.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.670 align:middle line:90%
But he was way far away.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:90%
She was standing by a tree.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And I looked over.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a violet column
that was coming out

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:90%
with my naked eye.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have my
camera or anything.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
he was doing at the time.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So I walk over.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
that same column.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And he captured it on film.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And I just thought--

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But what was cool about that or
what was awe-inspiring really

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.670 align:middle line:84%
about it was that
when he walked,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
when Paul walked to the
meadow, he was calling in.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He was receiving in the
violet flame in Saint Germain.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, he
walks within him.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So but you could see
him asking for it

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to bless the person that he
was taking the picture of.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So it was beautiful.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> One way I like to describe
some of the special energy

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:84%
sources that Paul gets in
some of his photos are,

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:84%
if you ever experience
the northern lights,

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.580 align:middle line:84%
which is up in Alaska, the far
North, where there's no light.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:84%
At one point there
it's always dark.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And the sun, the energy from the
sun, curves across basically,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:10%
the world atmosphere
of the world.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:10%
And it creates these
amazing flares of light.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Now you want to tell me
that that's not pure energy?

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that they're
those little points,

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and those little chirps
and spots of energy

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:90%
are always around us.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a gift to
be here on Earth.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:90%
We all chose to be here.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We chose every
single experience.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But what I've shared
with Saint Germain for me

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:46.480 align:middle line:84%
has brought me to know
who I am, Paul of Venus.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.229 align:middle line:84%
And this was the biggest
gift he's given to me.

00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:55.223 align:middle line:90%
[MELLOW MUSIC]

00:37:55.223 --> 00:38:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
After all that happened,
there came a message.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And this message came
from Saint Germain.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me to bring
people to Mount Shasta.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of love
to reflect to others.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
be able sometimes

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to be transparent, and
other times to amplify

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:90%
the energy with your own field.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Paul had an idea.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And not even an
idea, more a message.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.710 align:middle line:10%
And knowing that
that was something

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:10%
that he needs to create.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And he already brings
so many amazing people

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.560 align:middle line:84%
from around the world
together to the mountain.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And they receive so
much light and healing.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.237 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, it's still
very much a small town here.

00:38:46.237 --> 00:38:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say Mount
Shasta is special for several

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.480 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:10%
I believe that it
holds a frequency

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:10%
of the potential of new Earth.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.160 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, when
you arrive, you really

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
do feel like you're in
a different dimension.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The awakening of the whole
planet that is happening.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's this
concentration that is here,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.660 align:middle line:84%
based on past, ancient past
that we don't necessarily

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.250 align:middle line:90%
have historical record of.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that people who go to
see Paul or who are drawn to go

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to the mountain,
there is a reason.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:90%
There is a reason for that.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.500 align:middle line:84%
There is something within
them that starts to awaken.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The connection to
the essence of who

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you are, the connection to the
soul aspect of who you are,

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
the connection to love
and unity consciousness,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and the oneness, this is
what the mountain is doing.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It's calling people to come
back home to who they are.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're called here,
it is to simply aid you

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in your own return
home within self.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I believe each
of us on this planet

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
who are having this awareness,
and having this awakening,

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.520 align:middle line:84%
each have a unique
gift or gifts, rather,

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to the
becoming of new Earth,

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and the becoming
of authentic self.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And the way I perceive
the energy here,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:90%
it is already in that becoming.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, it reflects back
that potential within ourselves

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:90%
that helps to unlock the DNA.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
It helps to unlock
the truest expression.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:10%
And in that, we are shedding the
layers of who we think we are,

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.490 align:middle line:10%
the identities, the
masks, how we've

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:10%
operated in this collective,
and the old paradigm

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:10%
of the patriarchal, like
I'm separate from you.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:84%
When we come here,
we remember unity.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:90%
That is our truth.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:90%
We are connected.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.680 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.763 align:middle line:90%
We're one with each other.

00:40:50.763 --> 00:40:52.170 align:middle line:90%
We're one with Earth.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And Mount Shasta is this space
that holds that awareness.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It holds the remembrance.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we are
bringing forth on this planet.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And that which is not of
that truth, of that love,

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.040 align:middle line:84%
of that unity is
what we shed away.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we come here, she
helps us to shed those layers.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.546 align:middle line:90%
[MELLOW MUSIC]

00:41:18.546 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> People use the word magic
to describe Mount Shasta,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:90%
since there's a presence here.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.980 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's been
called the magic presence.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:10%
It's really just the
pure presence of God,

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:10%
of the one eternal being.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And I think that presence
shines through here,

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:10%
because here, there's
less separation.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.930 align:middle line:84%
There's less of
a veil separating

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the eternal spiritual world, and
the temporary physical world.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So here the energy of
the eternal presence,

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.732 align:middle line:84%
you could say the magic
presence, is amplified.

00:42:01.732 --> 00:42:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere in the Earth.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's amplified here.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's more accessible here.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why
people say it's magical,

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.610 align:middle line:84%
since they come here, and they
feel this eternal presence,

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:90%
which is magic.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It brings happiness, which
is magic just to feel happy,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.540 align:middle line:90%
just to be here.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Love is not just intimate.

It's caring.

It's exuding energy.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It's being a part of
the collective energy

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
what our journey is all about.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> My advice is to go here.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.990 align:middle line:90%
To go within.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Connect to your heart.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Connect to your love.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And to be in that space
as much as you can,

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.770 align:middle line:84%
because when you find
the love that you are,

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:84%
you experience yourself
in such magical ways.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.340 align:middle line:84%
You really understand
the power of who you are.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you know that you
are the embodiment of love,

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's in every cell
of your being is love,

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:84%
then you can go out and
really express yourself,

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.140 align:middle line:84%
express that love in whatever
it is that you decide to do,

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.230 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that you decide
to create on that planet.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Because that's who you are.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.420 align:middle line:90%
You are love.

do is you have to surrender

the world.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to leave
the world alone.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Let God happen.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Let God happen.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.780 align:middle line:84%
You fix the war here,
within your heart.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.960 align:middle line:84%
You fix the jealousy
here, the judgments here,

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:90%
within your heart.
