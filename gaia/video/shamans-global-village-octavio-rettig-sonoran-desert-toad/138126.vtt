00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Indigenous people across the
globe have used sacred plants

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and animal medicines for
millennia to heal, illuminate,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and connect them
to the web of life.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, each
culture had a healer

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that works on behalf
of their patients,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:90%
what we call the shaman.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And now we find ourselves
in a global village.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Is it any wonder that we
need our own healers that

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
understand the deep power and
sacredness these ancient earth

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:90%
medicines can reveal?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:84%
My name's Rak Razam, and
I'm an author, filmmaker,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:90%
and shamanic facilitator.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Join me as I interview
and sit in ceremony,

medicines with Western shamans

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:90%
across the globe.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Watch firsthand as I document
a modern shamanic resurgence

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
being passed on from
indigenous tribes

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to a new wave of medicine people
working in the 21st century.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
This is "Shamans of
the Global Village."

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
In many cultures
around the world,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
medicine men and women work
on behalf of their tribe,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
healing, divining, and
working with hidden energies.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The Western equivalent
would be a blend

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
between a doctor, a priest, and
a traveler between the worlds

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
who can mediate between the
spirits and their patients.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of these healers work with
psychoactive plants and animal

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
materials that
change consciousness.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Others work with trance, dance,
songs, and other modalities.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
a shaman is just

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
some archaic figure
wearing feathers and beads,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:90%
you may be surprised.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Modern shamans live
in towns and cities,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to meet one now.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're here in
Sonora in Mexico.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the county.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
city of Hermosillo.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is where Dr. Octavio
Rettig lives and works.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
He is a Western-trained
medical physician,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.685 align:middle line:84%
and he also works with the very
sacred medicine of the Bufo

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:90%
alvarius toad.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
And he works with the
indigenous Seri tribe.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And through them, he also has--

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll see here on the
stickers of his car,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:90%
he has United Nations support.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
He's auspiced by them working
with his indigenous medicine.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's able to
travel the world.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
We're here in his house
here in Hermosillo.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're just about to
meet Dr. Octavio Rettig.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.294 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Octavio.

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.304 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you here, man.

00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:34.104 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes sir.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Beginning of beautiful things.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I moved here 3 and 1/2 years
after my first encounter

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
with the toad medicine.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And I started to work as a
physician here in Hermosillo.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago, I
bought this place,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and I was pretending to create
a drug store in my consultation

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.889 align:middle line:90%
But that never happened.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've been a
freelance-- what is it,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:90%
general practitioner?

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:90%
GP?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, general practitioner.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.517 align:middle line:84%
I was working in a
consultory room with a drug

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:90%
store and a laboratory.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was the physician,
and I had the freedom

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to offer the patient
complete integral attention.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had the
medicines, but I had also

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the lab to do all the
consultation of the patients.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing around
20,000 patients a year.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.615 align:middle line:90%
I had a base of 50 people.

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:38.364 align:middle line:84%
And in one day, I saw 100 people
working as a physician there.

00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You were doing a lot of
patients and a lot of work with

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.185 align:middle line:90%
the community.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you enjoy the work?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.845 align:middle line:84%
Are you drawn to the role
as a doctor, as a healer?

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But I felt also a little bit
trapped inside of the room.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
medicine, or the work

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing now
with the toad medicine,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
it's helping more
people than the people

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:90%
that I treat in the pharmacy.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I love to be in service.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But this kind of
medicine, it's more

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
effective than the
other kind of medicine.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
Through these medicines,
you can see that it's

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:90%
a self-healing process.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And the people are doing
the work by themselves.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And in the Western
medicine, the patient

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is waiting for the doctor
to solve their problems.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be responsible
for our actions and ourselves.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And our habits are the
reason for being sick.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think that prevention
and daily activity

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and the changing your
patterns of behavior

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
can be the answer for having
a lower impact into the health

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:90%
system for the world.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that
the people now are

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
addicted to the idea of
finding the answer in a pill.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's really difficult to
find the healing to the pharma

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that the hospitals
are places for going to die.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're still having a
lot of fear about death.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But we are also missing the
beautiful quality of life

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that nature offered to us and
has offered to us in the past,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are really disconnected
of our own origins.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason for madness.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.938 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:48.938 --> 00:05:54.914 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.914 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, Rak.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you the
product of the product

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
of the medicine of this here.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
This is what the natives and
us have collected so far.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want to explain to
you the process of how

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.914 align:middle line:90%
we collect and do the medicine.

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So that looks like
a lot of medicine.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a lot of medicine.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
This has been collected
of maybe 1,000 toads.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> 1,000 toads.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe around 10 days,
six or seven people.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot of--

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> 1,000 toads.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> --a lot of work.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> In a bowl.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we do is we put
the toad under this glass.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:90%
We squeeze the gland.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the medicine in liquid
projected into the surface

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:90%
of the crystal.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So then we just scratch the
medicine from the crystal.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is the medicine.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So these suffer no any
kind of manufacturing

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:90%
or transformation.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just dried, and--

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And it crystallizes.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It crystallizes, and
that's the medicine.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's a really simple process.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's completely natural.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
We collected the
medicine last night.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And today, it's ready
for being scratched.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And it can be stored and kept
for long periods of time.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the reasons that I

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
assume that this in the past was
traveling all over the world,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
easy to transport

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:90%
and real easy to keep.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The toads are nocturnal
creatures that live for nine

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:84%
months of the year
below the ground,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
coming out of hibernation when
the monsoon rains come every

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:90%
summer.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Their secretions,
when dried and smoked,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
contain the king of
psychedelic compounds--

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
5 methoxy N,N
dimethyltryptamine,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:90%
or 5-MeO-DMT.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
This molecule is endogenous
to the human brain

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and all mammals, and also
exists in many plant species.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It has a rich history of
shamanic use around the world

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and has also been
nicknamed the God molecule.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It smells kind of fishy,
like fish food or something.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And they glisten.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's this
crystalline structure.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of pale,
creamy, yellow, golden.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting
that it's crystalline.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
that structure in nature

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:84%
where it holds a
circuit of energy.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:84%
And for that liquid to go into
a crystalline formation just

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:90%
seems very, very special.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It is something remarkable
that this substance

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
has existed since a long
time and suffer no any kind

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:90%
of transformation or change.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:90%
It's still being the same.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The toad has suffered no
change, millions of years.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And humans, we are
suffered change.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
this medicine, it's

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
really related with
the development

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And so for the average
dose, this is a whole thousands

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:90%
of toads.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
How much is an average
dose for one person?

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on the size of
the toad and the age of the toad

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
and the gender of the toad.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, small toads
have a lot of medicine.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
the differences

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
between the medicine
or the concentration

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
inside one toad to
another toad or if there

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
is any differences
related with the size

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:90%
or the age or the gender.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So not sure.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see that different
toads have different

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:90%
concentrations.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And the effect induced
by the medicine,

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:84%
it's different because of
the reaction of the person.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's also because
of the toad that contain.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So we are doing
different researches.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
We are doing some kind
of a standard dose,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
making the powder of
everything and mixing it

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
so we can have many
different toads

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe have a
different experience.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But so far, I prefer just
the flake of one toad.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And the dose that
everyone needs,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
it's different depending also
the condition of the body.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not only the experiences
with prior medicines.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It's more connected
with the relationship

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that people have with the
body, the ability that they

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
have for breathing, for
moving, for dancing.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's an indicator
of the ability

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.425 align:middle line:84%
that they have for
connect with other space.

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> To go with the
flow of the medicine.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, instead of
resisting or controlling.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And there is no toxicity or
overdose of this medicine.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But the amount that
you need for having

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
full, complete experience
is really tiny.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And so then you put that
into the delivery mechanism,

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
into the pipe.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if we put this in any
kind of fire, any kind of heat,

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:90%
this will be combusted.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
If we use just a
candle or just rocks,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
this will be melted
directly into the rock and--

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Into the air.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> --provides to everyone
the effect of this medicine.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The same intensity effect,
or a lower dose effect?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as faster and
stronger the flame,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
more intense the
effects will be.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:10%
>> The latest research in
immunomodulation suggests that

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:10%
tryptamines like 5-MeO-DMT
can have a beneficial effect

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:10%
on the human immune system.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
5-MeO can suppress inflammation
in the body and retard tumor

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:90%
growth and autoimmune diseases.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:84%
It also suggests that
5-MeO may support

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
flushing the system
clean of toxic buildup.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Octavio has used
the toad medicine

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
to treat serious
cases of addiction

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to synthetic drugs like
crystal meth and crack cocaine

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and has a high success rate with
these patients, both indigenous

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:90%
and Western.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Even heroin addicts
have seen their desire

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
for the drug lifted with
no withdrawal symptoms

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and insight into the root
causes of their behaviors.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Octavio asks that
his patients not

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:84%
get lost in the ego-dissolving
psychedelic effect.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Because as well as the
somatic physical cleanse,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
5-MeO often induces a
classical mystical experience

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of the white light, an
oceanic, all-encompassing void

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:90%
of unity consciousness.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
This spiritual reunion
is the ultimate medicine

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
to remember who and
what we really are.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is a regular flame.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And you will see how
the medicine starts to--

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It vibrates.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:52.036 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.036 --> 00:13:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see that it starts
changing the color if last long

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
time in there, and
also the effect.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
This needs to be
ingested really quick.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And if the medicine
burns faster,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:90%
than you go with more intensity.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Because this already
lost part of the effect

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.051 align:middle line:84%
because it was too
long burn in there.

00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like bad coffee.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It goes off a bit.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is like
an alive molecule.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:90%
It's something organic.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I also measure the
amount of the medicine

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:90%
before being combusted.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And also, I scratch
the residual so I

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
know how much of the medicine
really has been burned.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know that if I
burn 65 milligrams,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and I scratch the residual,
I will have around just 20

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:90%
to 25 milligrams been consumed.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is like the amount
of the 5-MeO-DMT in weight.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when
you ingest the gas,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
you're only ingesting
the 5-MeO-DMT.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make an
analysis also of this thing

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to see what's this.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So you think it converts
to some other chemical.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we can learn a
lot of the chemical residuals,

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
but also because I want to find
the same substance in some kind

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:90%
of archaeological sites.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So that will be the proof
that people in the past

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:90%
were using this.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
None of the tribes of
the desert or Mexico

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
remember in recent times
the usage of this medicine.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But the presence
of the toad, it's

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:84%
among all the ancient
tribes of Mesoamerica.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And I will show you
the evidence that

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
proves that this
knowledge, it's not new.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's directly related
with the most sacred part

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.256 align:middle line:90%
of the vision of the world.

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:10%
>> So this is the
chemical composition,

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:10%
according to Western science,
of what the neurochemical makeup

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:10%
of--

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.590 align:middle line:10%
is in the toad.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:90%
In the drugs.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> In the drug.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This is not what
we are consuming.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.973 align:middle line:84%
This is not the medicine
that we are having.

00:16:38.973 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you milk the toad and
the secretion is on the glass,

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:90%
it dries.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
We scrape it into those
flakes that we saw.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is--

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the flake.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.735 align:middle line:90%
>> --the drug flakes.

00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is interesting.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:84%
What are these
chemical signatures?

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is all
the different molecules

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of the intergens that exist, the
sacred medicines of the planet.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have LSD, LSA,
the morning glory seeds;

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin, the magic
mushrooms; DMT and 5-MeO--

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.035 align:middle line:84%
DMT which occur in
our human brains

00:17:09.035 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and throughout
the plant kingdom;

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
bufotenin in the toads;
harmine and harmaline

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is the constituents
of Ayahuasca;

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:90%
ibogaine from the ibota plant.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:84%
These are actually all
the chemical signatures

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred plant medicines
of the shamans of the world,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And the LSD that is the
invention that provides humans

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to remember
something that already exists

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
in nature because you can
see that the molecule,

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:90%
it's exactly the same as LSA.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just one step
different from LSA,

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
the morning glories is.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, LSD is the
Western shamanic medicine.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the first really en masse
that the West got in the '60s.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it's
something in the middle,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
something in between the
medicines and the chemical

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:90%
substances.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
that nature already

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
have the perfect
pharmacopeia, and this

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
is the slide that shows that we
already have the things that we

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.900 align:middle line:90%
are looking for.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.316 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is so interesting
because this is what we want

00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
to talk about in this show, is
the fact that the planet makes

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
or produces or secretes the
essence of her goodness.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's the most concentrated
magic enters these plants

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:10%
and into our own
brains with the DMT.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're sacred.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're designed
to be taken by humans.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
They slot into our
brain structure.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we learn a right
relationship with the plants.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And so a synthetic substance
as the West knows--

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:84%
the West takes all
the sacred substances,

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to tobacco
and cocoa and everything,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and it turns it into a
drug because it doesn't

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.039 align:middle line:90%
have right relationship.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't understand
what to do with it.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:90%
We broke a sacred pact.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We broke the sacred pact,
which is now being re-woven

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
by these modern shamanic
practitioners like yourself.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a codex of the
foundation of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:90%
clan.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And you can see a fish.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the right of the
fish, there is a toad.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
There is also the symbol
of the feathered serpent,

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:90%
who is standing in a nopal.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol of
the Mexican flag.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But this is an ancient
and pre-Hispanic,

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.310 align:middle line:90%
pre-Colombian symbol.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But the most interesting
part of this image

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the clothing of one
of the foundators of the city,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
it's the same pattern
that the Mayan who

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
existed 1,000 years before the
Aztecs, were already using.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:10%
And in the art, you will see
the toad and this same pattern,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:10%
really.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like the
dots on the toad.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And also, it creates, like,
a crisscross latticework,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:90%
which is like the--

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
well, some people
say in the whiteness

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:84%
of the toad, the void, it's
like the field of being.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like the unified field
has a latticework to it.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And then we see it again.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
This plate is in the
Museum of Anthropology

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and History in Mexico City.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the same pattern
than the one of the toad.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But this same pattern also
appears in the Popol Vuh

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:90%
in the Mayan tree of life.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So all through Mesoamerica.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all through Mesoamerica.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.516 align:middle line:84%
>> They all have
the toad pattern.

00:20:28.516 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the Popul Vuh.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the creation
of the world.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
same pattern and even

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.570 align:middle line:90%
the presence of the toad.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

00:20:38.703 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So these ones, these plates
show the same pattern exactly

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
located on the back of the
toad on the place of the gland.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So the toad and the
glands are shown

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
in all this art over
and over and over again,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
not only in the Mayans, but also
in the Aztecs, in the Olmecs,

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
in the Toltecs,
and in the legends

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
of the creation of the world.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see clearly that these
guys are smoking something.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They have different
colors in their skin.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:90%
They actually look different.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But they are talking
about the same experience.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here
this jaguar, a snake,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:90%
in front of the fish.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And the fish is the water,
and the jaguar was the land.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And the toad is
the amphibian which

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:90%
goes between the two worlds.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Mayan legends,
the toad is a carrier

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
of the message of
gods to the humans.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:90%
He's the link.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
this is not myths.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This is something
related with science.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not a metaphor.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true, actually.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:84%
The toad, he's squeezing
himself the gland.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
symbol on the gland.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:13.565 align:middle line:84%
Those three dots are in
many different places.

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:90%
These are in [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:84%
You can see that from the
toad who is marked with an X.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you put one X with
another X with another X,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:90%
you will build the same pattern.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:34.475 align:middle line:84%
And the creator of Hunab Ku
have the solar disc in his hand.

00:22:34.475 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The creator of Hunab Ku,
the womb of the great mother.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The creator, the
creator of everything.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
building in [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the spiral located

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in the gland of the toad.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
the guy who's emerging

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
from the jaws of
the toad, he has

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:90%
both palms of hands inverted.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And they yesterday did the same.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
That's a symbol, proof
of the relationship

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of this Mayan building and
the 5-MeO-DMT because you

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
can see people going into
the same position induced

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:90%
by the Sonoran Desert toad.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
this concept that

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
was all over the world
in the ancient times,

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
it's related with the experience
induced by the 5-MeO-DMT.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the toad may not have
been indigenous to all these

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But the medicine was traded
to different cultures

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:84%
like Egypt, Peru, Crete,
Greece, Mesopotamia, Bolivia.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:90%
This can travel, can be stored.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if in the past
there were more than just one

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:90%
species like this in the world.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And many of these ancient
cultures across the world,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.491 align:middle line:90%
they had their medicine people.

00:23:58.491 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:90%
They had their shamans.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:90%
They had their own sacraments.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And they would trade with
other cultures the medicines.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:09.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a global shaman
culture in the past.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.316 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what's coming
back full circle right now.

00:24:12.316 --> 00:24:13.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:13.116 --> 00:24:15.767 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're looking for toads
out here in the Sonora County.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And the correct
way to do this is

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
under the auspices and the
commission of the Seri Tribe.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't go looking for these
toads out in the desert.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:90%
It's narco drug territory.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous.

He has all the right protocols
and permission to do this.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:90%
It is not something to do.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It is not sustainable,
and it is not right.

they duly receptive--

off with nothing.

So those guys know
that I need support.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But they are also
trapped because the laws

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.066 align:middle line:90%
that they are defending.

00:25:41.066 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's reasonable
people talking.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Communication, it's
the last frontier.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:84%
If we can just make

the importance of what
things are really,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
then it's just about being
honest, being sincere, being

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
clear and not
lying, not bullshit.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing nothing wrong.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing what
is better for myself.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And even the security
agency of the planet

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
should be helping me
because I'm dealing

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.312 align:middle line:84%

with UNESCO and UN.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:10%
and he works with NU.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:10%
So they invite me to
Venezuela, and they

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:10%
are dealing with these
international organizations

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:10%
that are given all the support
and all the logistic and all

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:10%
the permits to travel
with the sacred medicine.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:10%
But in my case, it's
a special situation

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:10%
because I'm not indigenous.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But I reintroduced this
to the indigenous people,

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and I learn the ancient
traditions of them with them.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:10%
And then they are giving
me the opportunity

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:10%
to do this as a gift,
but also because I'm

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:10%
the only one who is trained
by the medicine itself

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.880 align:middle line:10%
to do this for other people.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, you can see some
little froggies, like that one,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:90%
glowing.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%

difference between these ones

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and the toads.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:19.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, as you can see,
this is a lot of color.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any glands
on the bottom, yeah?

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't have-- they just
have the couple of glands.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:90%
behind the eyes.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
eye of these toads,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
it's also a little bit different
than the toad, the Bufo

And also, the skin.

You can grab the skin
and feel, like, they

haven't another texture.

Yeah?

of education that we have.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:90%
So I was completely a crackhead.

I spent 2 and 1/2
years like that,

trying all the different
ways out, and nothing worked.

I tried go back to any

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.294 align:middle line:90%

this dissolution of myself

But the most important
thing that I felt

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.650 align:middle line:84%
was the reconnection
with my breath.

It's more than just medicine?

00:35:29.003 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pure consciousness.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's pure love.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%
It's pure energy.

the doctrine of signatures.

And through them and the
permission they've given,

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:84%
there are now providers of the
toad medicine in the Seri tribe

And the role of the elders

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:90%

>> Seven, yeah.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Not because of
the toad medicine.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the
synthetic 5-MeO-DMT.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's because this
substance is not regulated.

there is no prior research

done with this medicine
in recent times.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So my research is the

to handle and manipulate the
toads and extract the medicine

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:23.330 align:middle line:84%

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.070 align:middle line:84%
this used to be all
their territory.

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And for the last
few millennia, this

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is where people lived before
they were put into the reserve

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.550 align:middle line:84%
by the government
and lived in houses.

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.420 align:middle line:90%
This is nature.

This is back into the

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:06.630 align:middle line:90%
of Sonora in this territory.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a mystical
little cave here,

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:13.280 align:middle line:84%
which has some cave art
in it, which goes back

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.649 align:middle line:90%
into the Seri mythology.

What is your final vision for
your role with this medicine?

00:57:04.085 --> 00:57:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Unifying the world
of the medicines,

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.700 align:middle line:84%
pulling together all the sacred
knowledge of our ancestors

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.355 align:middle line:84%
in one place, available for
everyone of this planet.

that will do for people?

>> I mean, there are
so many medicines.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.615 align:middle line:84%
And when Westerners hear
the way of medicine,

00:57:25.615 --> 00:57:28.860 align:middle line:90%
they think of aspirin or Prozac.

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.810 align:middle line:84%
These are plant
medicines and toad--

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.640 align:middle line:90%
these are earth medicines.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.870 align:middle line:84%

take earth medicines?

>> We go back to our origins.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And we are moving folk
forward from the madness

of the evolution that we create
because our egocentricity

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:56.750 align:middle line:84%

>> Aho.

00:58:03.825 --> 00:58:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Aho.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The really-- so much amazing
work on so many levels you were

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.860 align:middle line:84%
doing, reintroducing the
medicine to the tribe,

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and then to the world.

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And then not just the medicine,
but the culture and the lineage

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and the songs and the
knowledge and the way, the way.

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's not you.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's that you have accepted
the call from spirit

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.780 align:middle line:84%
to reanchor this medicine
and knowledge and way.

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
you are being supported

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:41.955 align:middle line:84%
by the tribe and the people
and the patients and the world.

00:58:41.955 --> 00:58:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You have great work to do,
and you are doing great work.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.275 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, brother.

00:58:50.275 --> 00:58:51.075 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

Thank you.

>> In the 1960s, author
Marshall McLuhan coined the idea

00:58:55.950 --> 00:59:00.240 align:middle line:84%
of the global village, of the
fact that we're all connected.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.360 align:middle line:84%
In ancient days, with
indigenous cultures in a tribe,

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.090 align:middle line:84%
in a 1-to-100 ratio,
they might just

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:07.980 align:middle line:84%
have one medicine
person or shaman

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.620 align:middle line:90%
per 100 people in the community.

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have 7 billion
people on this planet.

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So to match that ratio, we
need 70 million shamans.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.496 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about any one person

00:59:20.496 --> 00:59:21.870 align:middle line:84%
starting to relearn
and be called

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:23.940 align:middle line:90%
to action by these medicines.

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.540 align:middle line:84%
As one person learns,
they magnetize,

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.470 align:middle line:90%
and they find the others.

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:30.900 align:middle line:10%
And so now, many,
many people are

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.000 align:middle line:10%
being drawn to
the shamanic path,

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.280 align:middle line:10%
not just for their
own healing, but to be

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.040 align:middle line:10%
the caretakers and the
guardians and the vessels

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.170 align:middle line:10%
of these medicines
as they distribute

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:45.216 align:middle line:10%
through the planetary circuit
