00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:10%
certainly hold a
particularly important place.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
These objects have recently
gained greater popularity,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
thanks in part to
the studies conducted

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Eltjo Haselhoff.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
According to his theory,
the light spheres

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
could be the cause behind
crop circles, with which they

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:90%
have often been associated.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.506 align:middle line:84%
But the spheres began to
appear many years ago.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:10%
During the Second World
War airplane pilots

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:10%
on both sides of the war
reported on several occasions

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:10%
that they were flanked by
mysterious light spheres

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:10%
during their missions.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
These spheres could
execute maneuvers

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that would have been impossible
for the pilots' airplanes.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:10%
Their many attempts to outstrip
the spheres and avoid pursuit

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:10%
were unsuccessful.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, the
spheres often seemed

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.142 align:middle line:10%
to anticipate the maneuvers
of even the most experienced

00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:51.942 align:middle line:10%
pilots.

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:10%
They appeared in all
areas involved in the war,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:10%
from Europe to the Far East.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:10%
And it was soon clear that they
were not secret enemy weapons.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:84%
They were given the name Foo
Fighters, from a corruption

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.448 align:middle line:90%
of the French word fuir.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
And so they were frightened.

As they moved with
great freedom,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
they could come very close to
or move away from airplanes,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%

to investigate the
phenomenon did not officially

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
reach any serious result.
Initially the pilots

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:10%
and their superiors
were bewildered,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:10%
and understandably afraid that
the spheres were secret enemy

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:10%
weapons.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:10%

accustomed to this presence,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:10%
considering it innocuous.

pilots' statements

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
the objects were filmed
on several occasions,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
but the films have
since been kept

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.398 align:middle line:90%
in secret military archives.

Footage filmed by
random witnesses

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:10%
began to appear in the 1950s.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:10%
These films showed the objects
both alone and in groups.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:10%
And what we see in the images
confirms the statements

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:10%
made by the military pilots.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:10%
In this film we see
that the cameraman

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:10%
has located a sphere
hovering in the sky,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and an airplane flying nearby.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Among the first to suggest
that these craft may be

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial was the
Polish American George Adamski,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
the first and most famous
of the contactees, that

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is human beings who come into
repeated contact with beings

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
presumed to have come
from other worlds.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:10%
Adamski declared that
these flying objects

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:10%
were remote controlled
surveying probes

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:10%
that extraplanetary spaceships
had launched into Earth's

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:10%
orbit for study purposes.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:10%
Their shape could be
spherical or disk like.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:10%
And their size could vary
from just a few centimeters

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:10%
to several meters in diameter.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:10%
He filmed a number
of them in flight.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:10%
Over the course of the
years, further films

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:10%
added to the wealth of footage
showing these mysterious craft,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:10%
giving a sense of continuity
to their mysterious presence

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:10%
and origins.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:10%
This film was recorded
in January, 1976,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:10%
over Wiltshire during an
experimental Concorde flight.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It was filmed by British Airways
staff working on another plane.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
The maneuvers that the
white sphere executes

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
are perfect examples of what the
military pilots had described

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:90%
during the Second World War.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
The object flies
beside the Concorde,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
glides along its windows, and
then suddenly darts upward

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
at top speed.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:10%
In recent years these
probes have come ever closer

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:10%
to cities, at times
flying literally

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:10%
right above the rooftops,
sometimes even closer

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:10%
to our streets.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:10%
Amongst the most
significant material

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:10%
in which these probes
appear is this video,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:10%
recorded in the Capao Redondo
area of San Paolo, Brazil,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:10%
on January the 2nd, 1998.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
This video is all
the more interesting

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
because the object
was sighted very close

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to an inhabited area.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The object, which measures
approximately 20 centimeters,

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
made no noise, and was
found about 200 meters

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
from the young man who witnessed
it, Alan Bruno de Oliveira.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
A remarkable number of
witnesses saw the apparatus

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
undergo transformations.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
This was made possible by its
proximity to the witnesses,

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
as well as the duration
of the sighting.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
half an hour the probe

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
completed several
transformations

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
above the houses
of Capao Redondo.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The movements that
the little craft made

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
suggest that a form
of intelligence

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is driving it, halting
sharply, and suddenly changing

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:90%
direction and speed.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have its own
propulsion mechanism.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
These particular flying objects
were also sighted in Mexico.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.425 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the first of
these fascinating videos.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:10%
In Mexico City while a squadron
of military helicopters

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:10%
was being filmed
during a public show

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:10%
an apparently metal
object unexpectedly passed

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:10%
between the terrestrial
craft, to the amazement

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:10%
of the pilots who later
bore witness to the event.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:90%
This is a solid object.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
We can see that it
stands out clearly

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
against the dark outline
of one of the helicopters.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It makes a diagonal,
descending trajectory.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is most
certainly equipped

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
with its own propulsion
system, because it

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
flies through the strong
vortex of air created

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
by the helicopters'
rotary blades

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
without experiencing
any disturbance.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, this demonstrates that
the object cannot be a sounding

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
balloon, a hot air balloon, or
any other kind of gas filled

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.814 align:middle line:90%
object.

00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, we'll observe one of
these light spheres gracefully

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:10%
floating near the slopes
of the volcano Popocatepetl

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:10%
southeast of Mexico City.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:10%
This document shows another
one of these spheres flying

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.310 align:middle line:10%
at a very low altitude above
the Mexican city of Guadalajara.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The two videos of this
particular type of phenomenon

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to
show were recorded

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico City in 1998.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The first just two
days before the second.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
In these videos we see an
unidentified flying object

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.222 align:middle line:84%
in broad daylight,
filmed on different days

00:09:07.222 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:90%
near the same building.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:10%
In the first video
the object hovers

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:10%
by the side of the building.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:10%
When the witness zooms
in, we can clearly

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:10%
see the remarkable
brightness of the rosy color

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.365 align:middle line:10%
that the sphere emanates.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:10%


00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:10%
In the second video,
recorded two days later,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:10%
we initially see a dark
object cross the sky.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:10%
After a brief stretch,
it begins to descend,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:10%
and we can perceive a
change in its brightness.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:10%
After a slow and
indecisive glide,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:10%
we see it move once again along
the side of the same building

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:10%
shown in the previous video.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Then it rises again,
and slowly moves away.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.218 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:58.218 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:10%
>>Of the cases of
UFO contact that

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:10%
have come to light
in recent years,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:10%
one of the most interesting
from a photographic perspective

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:10%
is the case involving
Raul Dominguez of Mexico.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Dominguez has photographed
classic flying saucers, as well

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
as small spherical
ships like those

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.794 align:middle line:90%
we've seen in these videos.

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The objects seem to
be made of metal.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Dominguez reported that he
watched the objects suddenly

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
become transparent when an
airplane approached them,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
only to return to
a metallic state

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.737 align:middle line:84%
when the earthly
craft moved away.

00:10:43.737 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:10%
One of the first films to
show the spheres in a group

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:10%
was made in the United
States during the 1950s.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenon reappeared
in Mexico in the 1990s,

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and in a rather
widespread manner.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The large number of objects
shown in these videos

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:90%
caused quite a stir.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:10%
This video was
recorded in Mexico City

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:10%
on October the 27th,
1992, by Ulises Trujillo.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:10%
These formations seem to
represent the constellations.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico they were
dubbed "flotillas."

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:10%
In this short video one of
the objects increases speed,

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:10%
and, flying vertically,
passes by a slower object.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The presence of
light spheres is not

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
limited to the skies
over our planet.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
They have also been
sighted in space,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and filmed during both
American and Russian missions.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Extraordinary
early testimony was

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:10%
provided by the
American astronaut

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:10%
James McDivitt While flying
with the Gemini 4 in June, 1965,

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:10%
he succeeded in filming a sphere
that had approached his ship.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:10%
>>I happened to
glance out one time,

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.766 align:middle line:10%
and there against the black
sky was a white object.

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The geometry of it was sort
of like a beer can or a Coke

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:84%
can with a pencil
sticking out one

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:84%
of the round edges at
about a 45 degree angle.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:10%
>>In this short film, recorded
by the astronauts of the Apollo

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:10%
12, we see a white
sphere move quickly

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:10%
above the Moon's surface.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:10%
While the Apollo 17 was
landing on the lunar surface

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:10%
one of these white
spheres was filmed

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:10%
as it moved to the side of
the earthly space module.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:84%
During mission STS 51 A of
the American Shuttle Discovery

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
in November 1984, an
apparently metal object

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
entered into the video
camera's field of vision,

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
making a quick
maneuver to the right,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and then disappearing again.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
When watching the
scene again we can

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
see how the light and
shadows change as the object

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.936 align:middle line:84%
moves, in correspondence with
the overall light and shadows

00:13:20.936 --> 00:13:21.736 align:middle line:90%
in the scene.

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
This was not the first
occasion in which

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
the video cameras
installed on the shuttle

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:90%
detected these objects.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:10%
During mission STS
37 of April 1991,

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.534 align:middle line:10%
a nearly identical
object was filmed.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:84%
This time the object didn't
disappear straight away,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
but rather it swayed in
front of the video camera

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
long enough for us to observe
its features more closely.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
In a close up we can observe
a slight swinging motion

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:84%
as the object hovers
in front of the lens.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
We can also evaluate
how its shadow changes

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.125 align:middle line:84%
as it moves, indicating that
the object is three dimensional.

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The next video is even
more extraordinary.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It was recorded in August 1991
by a Japanese colleague who

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
accompanied Russian
astronauts Volkov

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and Krikalev on their mission.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Initially the images show
the shuttle bringing supplies

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
to the Mir Space Station.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Then the video camera
catches a glowing object

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:10%
that stands out clearly
against the dark space outside.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:90%
The object seems to move.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually due to
the unsteady hand of the person

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:90%
recording the video.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Later the footage
moves for a few seconds

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth's surface.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
When the camera returns to
the glowing object filmed

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
previously, we see that it's
distance from the planet

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
has decreased, and it is quickly
approaching our atmosphere.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It then disappears definitely
into the faint light.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The maneuver demonstrates that
unidentified flying objects

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.437 align:middle line:90%
enter into our atmosphere.

00:15:33.437 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time such a
clear video showing this kind

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:90%
of event had been recorded.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Specialists at the Russian
mission control center

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
call these phenomena anomalies,
a word that actually makes

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.645 align:middle line:90%
many significant implications.

00:15:49.645 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:10%
In this extraordinary
footage we find ourselves

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:10%
inside Moscow's
mission control center.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
We can see the
Russian space station

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:90%
projected on the giant screen.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
The video camera filming it is
on the American space Shuttle

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Discovery.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's filming the
moment of separation

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
from the Mir, which holds the
astronauts Vladimir Solovyov,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.985 align:middle line:90%
and Nikolai Budarin.

00:16:16.985 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The large map shows
the orbital route

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
followed by the
space station, which

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
was near the coasts of
South America at the time.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
At one point the person
filming in the control center

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
turns the video camera towards
the large screen to film

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
a scene that seems
truly unbelievable.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
We see a glowing, pulsing sphere
coming from the lower right

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
fly sideways along the
side of the orbit station,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and immediately
afterward another sphere

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
moves downward on the right
hand side of the screen.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Then on the right
hand side again

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
two further spheres appear,
one above and one below,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:84%
slowly moving across
the field of vision.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:84%
In the top left light panel
we can read the date and time.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
18th of November,
1995, at about 12:22.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Finally, yet another
spherical object

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
appears from above, flying not
far above the space station.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The Russian Space Agency
can give no real explanation

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
regarding the nature of these
spheres, which, as we've noted,

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
they very concisely
call anomalies.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
The video we're about
to see was recorded

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
by an American researcher who
prefers to remain anonymous

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:90%
for security reasons.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
A UFO research
enthusiast who has

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:84%
managed to install four
powerful satellite dishes

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:90%
in the courtyard of his home.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
He intercepted
transmissions made

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
during the shuttle's
joint mission

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:90%
with the Mir space station.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:90%
The images are astonishing.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
As the shuttle docks
and separates from Mir

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:84%
several pulsating objects
can be seen twirling

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:90%
near the earthly shuttles.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The maneuvers that many of these
objects make suggest that they

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:84%
are vehicles equipped with an
autonomous propulsion system,

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and that they cannot be
man-made satellites, meteors,

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
space debris, ice fragments,
or anything of the kind.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Their sudden acceleration,
or sharp halting movements,

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:84%
seem to demonstrate
that these vehicles may

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
be built with technologies
unknown to us.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:10%
This incredible
document is from mission

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:10%
STS 84 of the American
space Shuttle Atlantis.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the entire
filmed sequence.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We can make out part of
the shuttle's hull, and Mir

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
in the distance.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
As the video camera
reduces the field of vision

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
we note a group of
objects moving away

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:90%
from the Russian station.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
As the camera
continues to zoom in,

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.670 align:middle line:84%
two further objects appear,
making a diagonal trajectory

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
from the lower
right to upper left.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
The larger object comes
rather close to Mir.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Then another sphere
emerges on the right,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
following the same trajectory
of the previous ones.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.735 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Immediately afterward
we note a white sphere

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
in the lower right hand
corner of the screen,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.668 align:middle line:84%
followed by other smaller
and faster objects.

00:19:40.668 --> 00:19:53.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
When this first group is
about to move off screen,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
the shuttle's video
camera moves downward,

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
filming another group of
objects that have moved

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:90%
toward Mir in the meantime.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, the largest
of the three objects

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
halts its course, and,
accelerating slightly,

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.915 align:middle line:84%
it changes direction, moving
more vertically than before.

00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Finally, a new glowing, pulsing
sphere arrives from below.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it enters
the field of vision,

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.118 align:middle line:84%
it changes direction
and speeds up.

00:20:29.118 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Immediately
afterward, this craft

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
is followed by a
smaller object, and then

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
by a second, which flies out
from beneath the space station.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:84%
We'll now see the
most important phases

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
of this extraordinary
sequence, enlarged

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.248 align:middle line:84%
and at different speeds to show
the maneuvers more clearly.

00:20:53.248 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, one would think that
if these were flying detritus

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
or meteors, their number,
frequency, and proximity to Mir

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
would be a constant danger
to the life of the astronauts

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
on board, and to the integrity
of the space station itself,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
such that it would be
advisable to return to Earth.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
If this didn't
happen, it may mean

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that many of the
objects we've just seen

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
are of an entirely
different nature.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
According to the most
recent scientific research

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
there is a direct link between
light spheres and crop circles.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
In addition to statements
made by various witnesses,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
there are videos in which we
see these little white spheres

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.205 align:middle line:84%
floating above the fields where
these fascinating designs have

00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:45.005 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Of all the documents
showing these objects,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the one that has caused
the most sensation

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is the video in which
we can see spheres

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
flying over a wheat field.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
In just a few seconds a design
looking like a snowflake

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:90%
appears in the field.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
The video was
recorded at 5 o'clock

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
in the morning on
August, the 11th, 1996

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.585 align:middle line:84%
by John Whabley, an English
crop circle enthusiast,

00:22:12.585 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:90%
near Oliver Castle in England.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:22.252 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.252 --> 00:22:23.052 align:middle line:10%
>>OK.

00:22:23.052 --> 00:22:26.028 align:middle line:10%


00:22:26.028 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:10%
This is amazing.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>There has been much
controversy regarding

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:90%
the authenticity of this video.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But careful analysis conducted
by the American investigator

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Jim Dilettoso, an expert in
computerized video analysis,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.082 align:middle line:90%
found no trace of falsification.

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:10%
>>The key thing is that if
the Oliver's Castle image

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:10%
was made digitally,
that word digital says

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:10%
it went into a computer.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
In the vertical interval signal
of the copy that we have,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
there is no evidence that
it was ever digital format.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So point of the story
is, I find no evidence

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of the hoax in the Oliver's
Castle crop circle formation.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I find enough unique
and interesting things

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to think that it very
well could be real

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and should be studied further.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Other researchers have denied
the authenticity of the video.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But so far no one has been
able to provide valid evidence

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
to support this argument.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Furthermore, the design
appearing in the video

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
was real, and it had the
features of true crop circles.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
However, according to the famous
English crop circle scholar,

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
engineer Colin
Andrews, some doubts

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
have been raised due to the
strange behavior of the person

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:90%
responsible for the video.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:10%
>>So I am unfortunately,
as a researcher,

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:10%
not qualified in that field
simply to accept that Jim

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:10%
believes it, and others,
it to be technically real,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:10%
authentic and if the
[? ground ? ] workings

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:10%
of the individual concerned
highly questionable.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I am so sorry not to
be able to totally embrace it.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>In any case, while waiting
for a definitive verdict,

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:84%
the video gives us a visual idea
of what happens in these cases,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
the statements made

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:84%
by numerous, reliable witnesses
who have seen such a phenomenon

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:90%
take place.

balls of light, whatever

they are, flying
around in crop circles,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:10%
flying over the fields,
and sometimes even creating

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:10%
crop circles.

video is authentic or a fake,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:10%
one thing is certain.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:10%
It illustrates what
many people have

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:10%
observed throughout the world.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The videos we've seen so far
show an astonishing reality,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
unknown to most.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:84%

have emerged thanks

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.875 align:middle line:84%

these videos and testimonies

to know about these
testimonies and videos,

because today, after so much
skepticism and disbelief,

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
science is beginning to take
these phenomena seriously,

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
at least for study purposes.

>>Amongst the scientifically
valid studies on light spheres

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and their relationship to
the crop circle phenomenon,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
the recent work of
Professor Eltjo Haselhoff

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:90%
is quite noteworthy.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The professor is currently
one of the leading scholars

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%
of the crop circle phenomenon.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:84%
His research has analyzed
the possible link

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
between the deformations
of the nodes

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
in the wheat plants
sampled from the crop

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.650 align:middle line:84%
circles and an
electromagnetic source placed

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
at a certain height
above the wheat.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
The result of these analyzes
is displayed in this graph.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Each vertical bar represents
the average length

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of 20 staves in a specific
area within the circle.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
The perfect symmetry in
the graph is astonishing.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The same exact
correspondence was

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
found in three further cross
sections within the circle.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a highly
significant discovery.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The length of the
nodes is perfectly

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
symmetrical within
the crop circle.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It's circular in shape.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that
whatever mechanism

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
created the crop circle also
caused the nodes to lengthen.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
If this formation had been
caused by simply flattening

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the wheat with an
axle, as many think,

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
reason for the nodes

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to grow progressively toward
the center of the crop circle.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.605 align:middle line:10%
>>Every single plant has
the same amount of sunlight,

00:27:13.605 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:10%
of water, of
temperature, everything.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:10%
So how does a plant somewhat
in the center of the circle

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:10%
know that it is in the
center of the circle?

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
If you look at this distribution
of thermal expansion

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of these plants, of the cells,
you find that it perfectly

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:84%

distribution that

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:84%
would be created by
a little heat source,

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.421 align:middle line:84%
a spherical source of
electromagnetic radiation,

00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:84%
which would heat up
the crop, don't ask me

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:90%
how, the match is just perfect.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And actually you can extract
the height of this source

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:84%
from the distribution of
this thermal expansion.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And in one case the
height corresponded

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
to 4 meters and 10 centimeters,
while the eyewitness said

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:90%
it was about 3 or 4 meters.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:84%
The measurements taken for the
average length of the nodes

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.870 align:middle line:84%
have been discovered
to correspond perfectly

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to theoretical values if
the source of the radiation

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:84%
had been at a height of 4.1
meters above the plants.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
This finding perfectly
fits the statements

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.532 align:middle line:84%
made by witnesses and the images
shown in the Oliver Castle

So at that point in

you can't just ignore
what these people say.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
In the article he
arrives at the conclusion

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that the electromagnetic
light spheres

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
must be involved with the
development of the crop

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:84%
The article was published
in "Physiologia Plantarum,"

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.970 align:middle line:84%

physiology and biophysics.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to this publication
the idea that the flying light

responsible for the crop

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:84%
circles is no longer
just a hypothesis.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Thus, what we've seen so far has
confirmed that unusual objects

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:84%
are flying in our
skies, and producing

let a plane that

at his back.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.150 align:middle line:90%
So the objects are illuminated.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.700 align:middle line:10%
And the video gives a
better image of the spheres

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.974 align:middle line:10%
than we've ever seen before.

00:48:18.974 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.982 align:middle line:84%
Probably Hernandez is closer to
the phenomenon he is filming.

00:48:30.982 --> 00:48:37.870 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.640 align:middle line:84%
The object starts to
slow its spinning motion.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.071 align:middle line:84%
And then the incredible
scene continues.

00:48:43.071 --> 00:49:02.250 align:middle line:90%


00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.724 align:middle line:84%
Slowly the flotilla
begins to form.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.410 align:middle line:84%
When the film ends
Hernandez comments

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.800 align:middle line:84%
on the incredible scene
he's just witnessed.

were UFOs moving around,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.610 align:middle line:10%
They were yellow.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:47.097 align:middle line:10%
They were really beautiful, and
they were here, just behind me.

>>Comparing the two videos
of Carrillo and Hernandez

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.480 align:middle line:10%
we can clearly see that it
really is the same phenomenon.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The statements by witnesses,
the investigations,

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.200 align:middle line:84%
the exceptional images
leave little room

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:84%
for theories of fraud, mass
hallucinations, or pranks.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.060 align:middle line:84%
It is really difficult to
think that the spheres are not

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.440 align:middle line:84%
real, or the result
of intelligent life.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I have no doubt.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have accumulated
lots of film

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.890 align:middle line:84%
where we can see this
intelligent movement.

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:84%
They are part of a project that
is even greater than they are.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why we should
believe that we are dealing

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.240 align:middle line:84%
with a phenomenon that
shows the interest towards

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.230 align:middle line:84%

upon us, human beings.

Or perhaps it will be
the phenomenon itself

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:84%

it without waiting

In the past events have
changed human history.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Will we be taken by
surprise this time too?
