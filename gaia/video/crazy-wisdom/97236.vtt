00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:10%
There was an article in
the then Telegraph color

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:10%
supplement, and there was
a full-page photograph

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:10%
with Trungpa Rinpoche
and Akong Rinpoche

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:10%
standing on the lawn in front.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd seen it, and I
thought, I have to be with him.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So I gave up my job and
my house and travelled

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.465 align:middle line:90%
up to Eskdalemuir.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I was studying at
Cambridge University.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And I decide I'd prefer
to go live with him.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I arrived at Lockerbie
station late at night.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
There was no public
transport to Eskdalemuir.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.572 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked to Samye
Ling, and it's about 17 miles.

00:15:22.572 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have I think it must
have taken me about six hours.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
His injunction to me always was
that major change must always

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
be internal and that
without meditation, there's

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:90%
no progress.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The teaching sometimes would
be really kind of in the minute,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in conversation in his room,
sometimes late at night.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:90%
That was where I learned most.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
This got some of us
into a lot of trouble,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
because we would then have
to sleep late in the morning

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:90%
and not make morning meditation.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Rinpoche would leave Samye
Ling in his monk's robe

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and change into regular clothes
and wander around London a lot.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:10%
And he said he loved
the movie houses

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:10%
because they were
dark red velvet,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:10%
and it reminds him of Tibet.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It had the kind of warmth
that he was missing.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd been working in an
office as a translator,

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and he invited me to be
his private secretary.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:10%
He said that he was
planning to make

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:10%
a trip to Bhutan and India.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And then he asked me if I
would like to go with him.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course I said yes.

My trip to Bhutan

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
was invitation of
the queen of Bhutan.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And I took my retreat
in Taktsang, whereupon

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:90%
sometime I actually meditated.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Rinpoche said that
this was supposedly

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
where Guru Padmasambava had
thrown down his crystal rosary

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and then it turned
into a waterfall.

Being at Taktsang is not
particularly impressive

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:90%
toward the beginning.

What is this place that's
supposed to be great?

And what's happening here?

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is the wrong
place to have chosen.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's Taktsang somewhere
else, the real Taktsang.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%

I think that that
particular period in Scotland

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
was really the bleakest
period in his life.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Before the accident,
Trungpa Rinpoche

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
had spoken about the dilemma
that he felt. The term he used

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.699 align:middle line:84%
was "the golden Buddha
on the pedestal."

00:22:48.699 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Our main point is
to be able to teach

on the people's part.

they don't look at you or
they don't listen to you,

I think people found
it too threatening.

The English people, with
their sense of propriety

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, may
have wanted to have

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:90%
the sort of little pet guru.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, the Tibetans

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
wanted him to wear his robes
and hide behind the Tibetan

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of sense of
subtle superiority.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, just
study the Dharma, which

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
is the truth of
trusting who you are,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
discovering your own
fundamental goodness,

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.270 align:middle line:84%
discovering your natural wisdom,
and discovering the importance

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:90%
of being compassionate.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.703 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to
do with religion.

00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The shrine room was the
attic of an old farmhouse.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And holding up the roof,
seemingly, were these posts.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, the posts became the
favorite spot for people

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:10%
to lean up against during
sitting meditation practice,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:10%
so that they could doze
or just hold themselves up

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:10%
and sort of be lazy about it.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.791 align:middle line:84%
So one day, we go into the
shrine room, and they're gone.

00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was him.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:84%
He had been there
two weeks earlier

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and said, take them
out, unbeknownst to us.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So how he often would work
is that there would just be,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:84%
most of the time, just a
quarter turn of the screw.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a big thing.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It was just suddenly
like where you

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
used to hang out so
that you could slump

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:90%
was no longer slumpable.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So now you had to
actually sit up.

This is a picture of the
door at Karme Choling.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was just a
white door, ratty paint

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.870 align:middle line:90%
crumbling farmhouse.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he wanted
to paint it as the entrance

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:90%
to the Dharma in the West.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:90%
It was very important.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And he explained
to me the geometry,

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometry,
and how it intersects

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.210 align:middle line:90%
with how your eye is wired.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
The rods and cones in your
eye are actually wired

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.500 align:middle line:84%
into geometric patterns and
how the door, the geometry

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.310 align:middle line:84%
of the door, would go
directly into your eye

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.609 align:middle line:84%
and set off certain kind
of signals in your brain.

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:90%
We could not find a turquoise.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:84%
We left all this stuff
on the front porch,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and there was a little
girl, about five

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:90%
years old, that was playing.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we were down at
the tent at the teachings,

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.909 align:middle line:84%
she had poured all the
paint into a bucket.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And we came back, and
she'd mixed it up,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and it was the
perfect turquoise.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.889 align:middle line:84%
And it was getting dark by then,
so Chogyam said, oh, my God,

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:90%
it's perfect.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So we took all the
cars and circled around

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
with the headlights and put
the headlights on the porch

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:84%
while he sat there
and supervised

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.662 align:middle line:90%

There is a legend of the
Buddha, where every step,

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.190 align:middle line:10%
lotus flowers bloom.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.880 align:middle line:10%
Almost wherever Chogyam
Trungpa in America,

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.597 align:middle line:10%
Tibetan Buddhist
centers sprang up.

00:35:12.597 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:10%
Very early on, maybe
in the first year,

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:10%
he invited the entire community
that could fit in his living

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:10%
room up to visit
him, and he invited

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:10%
everybody to bring their bags
of marijuana, their dope.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And half the people thought, oh,
my God, this guru is so cool.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:90%
He wants to smoke with us.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So everybody came and
was in a very jolly mood.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And he asked everybody to
put all their paraphernalia

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.560 align:middle line:90%
on a big tray in the center.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And there was a beautiful
fire going in the fireplace.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It was all very
homey and wonderful.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And he began to
talk to everybody

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:90%
and welcome everybody.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And then one little
bag after the other

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:84%
got thrown into the fire,
creating all of this spark

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and popping.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And he began to chant, we
are burning self-deception,

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
we are burning self-deception,
we are burning self-deception,

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:90%
with each bag.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And the fire would blaze up.

the answer

the summer of '74

Blues has more possibilities.

wanted was not to
do that at all,

was to maintain the

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:21.660 align:middle line:84%
The people liked
getting both sides.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated
with-- they were

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.240 align:middle line:90%
like there was a tennis match.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They were like-- they were
Trungpa said this and Ram Dass,

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.290 align:middle line:90%
uh, uh.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.196 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
discuss spirituality

00:42:38.196 --> 00:42:42.160 align:middle line:84%
at this point in this
particular class,

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel very nervous
myself, and so should

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
you, that we are not to
building mutual deceptions

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:90%
between each other.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:43:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We have coined this word
called "spiritual materialism."

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual materialism, which is
dedicated to pursuing the self,

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:12.940 align:middle line:84%
ego, that you use
mantras, chantings,

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:84%
meditations, all kinds to become
a greater and powerful person.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.150 align:middle line:10%
He did not give a talk in
the first five or six or eight

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.760 align:middle line:10%
years without
reminding people how

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:10%
foolish their grappling after
spirituality to save themselves

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.670 align:middle line:10%
was.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:35.990 align:middle line:10%
He was cruel from the point
of view of relentlessly

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:10%
dismantling whatever
you could use

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:44.170 align:middle line:10%
to cling on to some
constructed version of ego.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Let us mock the ego.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But let us build
our spirit, spirit

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:04.980 align:middle line:84%
in this case as a sense of
inquisitiveness that something

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.340 align:middle line:90%
might have happened.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a possibility
something has taking place.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But ego's approach is that, is
that going to be good for me?

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Should I do it?

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't I do it?

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
If I get it, how much of it
is money's worth, so to speak?

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Trungpa was the head, and I
was the heart, things like soul,

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:84%
God, Ram, and Krishna
and all that, that seemed

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.940 align:middle line:90%
like cluttered compared to him.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.540 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely important to
make a practice of meditation

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:84%
as a source of your
strength, source

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:90%
of your basic intelligence.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.865 align:middle line:90%
And think about that.

00:44:56.865 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You know there is
such a possibility

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.370 align:middle line:84%
you could certainly do nothing
for 20 minutes, 10 minutes.

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Just sit and do nothing.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You can think about
Naropa Institute

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.450 align:middle line:84%
while you're
sitting if you like.

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be too
embarrassed to tell that message

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to your parents and
relatives, your friends,

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that you've learned
very valuable

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.930 align:middle line:84%
message, that you can actually
survive by doing nothing.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Rinpoche had a great
command of English.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.590 align:middle line:84%
He said English is
a blessed language.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:90%
He'd speak redneck.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.400 align:middle line:84%
He'd speak (AMERICAN ACCENT)
American Chamber of Commerce,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.670 align:middle line:84%
he'd speak (BRITISH
ACCENT) Oxonian English.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't just a mimicry.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.784 align:middle line:84%
His mind sort of entered
into the American mindset

00:45:56.784 --> 00:45:58.317 align:middle line:84%
and realize you had to
do it through language.

00:45:58.317 --> 00:46:03.420 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You used the word
inaccessible in referring

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.930 align:middle line:90%
to Vajrayana teachings.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
implication there?

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very
rare, and therefore

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.660 align:middle line:90%
you probably don't get it.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And like if you order
steak tartare, rare people

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.470 align:middle line:84%
order such dish,
and usually somebody

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:41.745 align:middle line:90%
order hamburger or hot dog.

00:46:41.745 --> 00:46:45.022 align:middle line:90%
And steak tartare is very rare.

00:46:45.022 --> 00:46:49.134 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.134 --> 00:46:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And a crucial moment came when
the great 16th Karmapa, who

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.470 align:middle line:84%
was the head of Chogyam
Trungpa's lineage

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:00.510 align:middle line:90%
is coming to the United States.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:middle line:84%
He tells you, like the
students, this great news,

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the 16th Karmapa's coming,
and the response is, groovy,

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:84%
but do we really have
to vacuum for him?

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:22.320 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.040 align:middle line:84%
He worked tirelessly, hours
and hours around the clock,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:84%
getting ready for this visit,
having people go and get

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:84%
decent clothes,
cutting your hair,

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:84%
getting suits and ties,
which most people went

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.130 align:middle line:84%
to the Salvation Army
to get because nobody

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.660 align:middle line:90%
had any money, particularly.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.770 align:middle line:90%
That infuriated people.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.400 align:middle line:10%
Sexuality didn't shock
people in those days.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.770 align:middle line:10%
Drinking didn't shock people.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.650 align:middle line:90%
But wear a suit?

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.615 align:middle line:84%
So many, many students left
at that point in protest.

00:47:52.615 --> 00:47:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.860 align:middle line:10%
All of the forms or
rituals or disciplines

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.140 align:middle line:10%
are ways of shifting
the mind, first of all

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:10%
to create some
kind of wakefulness

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.660 align:middle line:10%
so that you can even
appreciate what's going on,

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.410 align:middle line:10%
and then to connect us into
the particular activity that's

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.480 align:middle line:10%
taking place.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.660 align:middle line:84%
You need a kind
of majesty inside

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.922 align:middle line:84%
to meet the majesty
outside of yourself.

00:48:20.922 --> 00:48:26.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.870 align:middle line:84%
What you have recommended to
us is that we should cut off

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:84%
our long hair, put on neckties,
and reenter the mainstream

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:39.430 align:middle line:84%
of American institutions and
attempt to exert a wholesome

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:84%
influence from within.
-That's right.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:48.608 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:48.608 --> 00:48:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.880 align:middle line:90%
[HORN HONKING]

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.974 align:middle line:84%
We always have a problem
of containing ourselves.

00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:08.490 align:middle line:84%
That is why we have to resort
to religion, basically,

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:20.680 align:middle line:84%
taming, [INAUDIBLE],
simply being decent,

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:27.340 align:middle line:84%
no ups and downs, some
sense of equilibrium,

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.250 align:middle line:90%
natural state of existence.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.770 align:middle line:84%
That kind of training
demanded a teacher who

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:90%
was hard to be around a lot.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Once I asked him, why
don't more students

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:84%
just come see you, knock on the
door or call you on the phone,

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.650 align:middle line:90%
come over?

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I feel that
it is because there's

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:57.980 align:middle line:84%
a fear in students of
becoming unmasked, exposed.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:03.170 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:06.300 align:middle line:84%
This was a very important
principle for him,

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.510 align:middle line:84%
people having the
courage to work

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:90%
with their own self-deception.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Where does purpose
and motivation

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:22.480 align:middle line:84%
come in the enlightened mind
that is free from desire

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and striving?

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Where does his
purposes come from?

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, purposes come from having
a sense of trust in oneself,

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.820 align:middle line:84%
a sense of uprightness,
a sense of loyalty,

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.090 align:middle line:84%
a sense of appreciation
of one's family

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and one's immediate
world around you.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:53.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a cloud in the
sky, and skies are blue,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and the sun rises
beautifully in the East.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And snowflakes have their beauty
in the falling on the ground.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.503 align:middle line:90%
And everything is perfect.

00:51:08.503 --> 00:51:11.674 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.674 --> 00:51:12.895 align:middle line:90%
Uh, pretty much.

00:51:12.895 --> 00:51:16.528 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:16.528 --> 00:51:20.840 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.100 align:middle line:84%
He was always teaching us
from the crazy wisdom style.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And the teaching was
there is no certainty,

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and you could have a
sense of humor about that.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:44.132 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.132 --> 00:51:48.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
really be fully sane.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be our
problem, usually, that we

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.470 align:middle line:90%
can't handle too much sanity.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And we would like to have a
little corner for neurosis

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:02.700 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, even in our
pockets, just a little puff

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.850 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you find too much sanity,
you say, boy, it was heavy.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.670 align:middle line:84%
This is Tantric
tradition of Tibet,

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:45.790 align:middle line:84%
that enjoying your senses
is itself expressing wisdom.

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And even Franklin said that
wine is proof that God loves

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.088 align:middle line:10%
us and wants us to be happy.

00:52:53.088 --> 00:52:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Not a strange idea.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:00.970 align:middle line:90%

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.800 align:middle line:90%
So did Thomas Jefferson.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.610 align:middle line:84%
He went broke getting good
wine from France to drink.

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:14.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It was safe to
say that his level

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:84%
of awareness in the environment
was unaffected by the alcohol.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:27.130 align:middle line:10%
Early on, he was giving
a talk with this sort

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:32.140 align:middle line:10%
of Western, New Age guru,
and Rinpoche's presence

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:36.667 align:middle line:10%
in this on the stage was that
he was just completely drunk.

00:53:36.667 --> 00:53:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And he actually, I don't think,
ever actually gave a talk.

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:84%
He was just falling
out of his chair.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And so at the end
of the talk, they

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.830 align:middle line:84%
sort of carried
him under his arms

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:47.087 align:middle line:90%
and got him into the elevator.

00:53:47.087 --> 00:53:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And he got in the elevator,
and he stepped straight,

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.439 align:middle line:90%
and he said, how was that?

00:53:51.439 --> 00:53:55.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] He wasn't drunk.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:59.980 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't lost it at all,
but that was how he chose

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.010 align:middle line:90%
to relate to this charlatan.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:10%
Many people tried to get
Rinpoche to stop drinking.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:11.720 align:middle line:10%
And they would take petitions
to him and letters to him

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.620 align:middle line:10%
and have everybody sign it.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I remember being there one
time, and one of his attendants

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.070 align:middle line:84%
served the watered-down
sake, and he

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:84%
would just left his eyebrow
and say, this is watered down.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:30.640 align:middle line:10%
It's just basic craziness,
which is fearlessness,

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.650 align:middle line:10%
in other word, not
giving up anything,

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:42.180 align:middle line:10%
seemed to be the basic
point, willing to work.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But what is there on the basis
of primordial wakeful quality,

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.454 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to be the
definition of crazy wisdom.

00:54:54.454 --> 00:55:00.730 align:middle line:84%
--[NON-ENGLISH] the sexuality
issue, the alcohol issue.

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.670 align:middle line:10%
I did basically
defend it, actually,

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.050 align:middle line:10%
because I liked
Tibetan Buddhism,

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:08.100 align:middle line:10%
and I know there is such
a thing as crazy wisdom.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But I have to acknowledge
certain flaws, I believe.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, he passed,
I believe, at 47.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, he could
still be doing fantastically

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:22.211 align:middle line:84%
useful work if he had not
gotten addicted to alcohol,

00:55:22.211 --> 00:55:22.910 align:middle line:90%
definitely.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the exact
diagnosis was,

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.480 align:middle line:90%
he definitely drank too much.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.830 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, how could
you follow a teacher like that?

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Or how could an
enlightened person do that?

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I do not know.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't buy a party
line where I say,

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.600 align:middle line:84%
it was sacred activity, or
something like this, come

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:90%
up with ground to make it OK.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I also can't come up
with ground or fixed idea

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:50.280 align:middle line:90%
to make it not OK.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm really left in
that I don't know.

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:01.325 align:middle line:84%
But I can't answer the relative
questions, because he defied

00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:03.059 align:middle line:90%
being able to answer them.

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:17.240 align:middle line:10%
When Suzuki Roshi
died, Chogyam Trungpa

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.490 align:middle line:10%
gave a talk at the Zen Center.

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:22.230 align:middle line:10%
And as he was
giving the talk, he

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:25.660 align:middle line:10%
said that Suzuki
Roshi was a very great

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:30.580 align:middle line:10%
teacher and a very dear friend.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.747 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
he began to weep.

00:56:32.747 --> 00:56:39.900 align:middle line:90%


00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So he could probably
just sense and see

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that we were trying to
hold ourselves back,

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and it gave us permission
for all of us to weep.

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.895 align:middle line:84%
So that in itself was
a wonderful teaching.

00:56:55.895 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:90%


00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Most cultures at
their inception

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:14.600 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of idea of trying
to bring out the noblest part

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.554 align:middle line:90%
of the human spirit.

00:57:15.554 --> 00:57:19.186 align:middle line:90%


00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Rinpoche's search for models
that would work in the West,

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:26.130 align:middle line:84%
he didn't just want to
impose Eastern models

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:28.860 align:middle line:90%
onto his Western students.

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.990 align:middle line:84%
In America, the president
of the United States

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.670 align:middle line:90%
lives and works in his house.

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe, the place
where the monarch lived

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.680 align:middle line:90%
was also the seat of government.

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.590 align:middle line:10%
So that's one thing.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.060 align:middle line:10%
I think he realized that
that was a powerful model

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.310 align:middle line:10%
that had already existed.

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Court was this really rich
environment that was his home,

00:57:55.620 --> 00:58:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of a community
center at the same time.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.580 align:middle line:84%
In Boulder during
Rinpoche's lifetime,

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.940 align:middle line:84%
my main role was the
master of the household,

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.830 align:middle line:84%
was my title, of
the Kalapa Court.

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Like a typical evening at the
court, the music being played

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.550 align:middle line:90%
might be Mozart, Handel.

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:19.825 align:middle line:90%
He loved Handel's Water Music.

00:58:19.825 --> 00:58:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Crisp, tongue-in-cheek
British formality,

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.120 align:middle line:84%
call each other like Mr.
Pisinger, and this is Fordham.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.980 align:middle line:84%
This is not just like
saying a nice thing,

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:43.580 align:middle line:84%
but that anything and
everything can be met.

00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:47.010 align:middle line:84%
When we meet it with awareness,
there's potential to uncover

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:48.760 align:middle line:90%
some kind of power.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there
is nothing that

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.800 align:middle line:90%
is outside of the practice.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, he introduced
almost a practice

00:58:56.230 --> 00:59:01.260 align:middle line:84%
for anything, absolutely
anything, you know,

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.704 align:middle line:84%
drinking a cup of tea,
combing your hair,

00:59:03.704 --> 00:59:04.870 align:middle line:84%
putting your
underwear in a drawer.

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.920 align:middle line:84%
One time I had the
experience of watching

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.240 align:middle line:90%
him set the dining room table.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And it took three hours, because
it was like a work of art

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.609 align:middle line:90%
to set the dining room table.

00:59:20.609 --> 00:59:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:32.580 align:middle line:84%
He really found
the way Americans

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:36.900 align:middle line:90%
spoke English to be sloppy.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it reflected that
if you didn't work with how you

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.930 align:middle line:84%
spoke that there
was a way in which

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:45.250 align:middle line:90%
body and mind were not joined.

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So speech is one
of the things that

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.250 align:middle line:84%
can really join those
so that you have

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:51.660 align:middle line:90%
everything sort of lined up.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.040 align:middle line:84%
You have synchronized your
body, speech, and mind.

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So he took that
to the next level,

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and he started not
only teaching people

00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.950 align:middle line:84%
how to speak the
English language,

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:04.240 align:middle line:84%
but he decided to teach
them the Queen's English.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.350 align:middle line:84%
How to speak the
English language

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and how not to
speak Americanism.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:14.730 align:middle line:90%


01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.180 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll
give you an example

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.200 align:middle line:90%
of an elocution exercise.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
(ENUNCIATING
CLEARLY WITH BRITISH

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.570 align:middle line:90%
ACCENT) Spider is black.

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Sky is blue.

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
How tantalizing this world.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Cathy's hair is black.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.986 align:middle line:90%
Her complexion is white.

01:00:38.986 --> 01:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Her attention is like a bow
string, more than monumental,

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
more than tattered,
more than dying.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The Liberty Bell is
more than antique.

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.860 align:middle line:90%


01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, he was
trying to demonstrate

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:middle line:90%
how sound had a sacred element.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So in spite of the appearance of
torturing people by making them

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
repeat these words
over and over again,

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it was much
more about appreciation.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.410 align:middle line:90%


01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So actually, it became
a visualization practice.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
You would come on duty,
put on our uniforms,

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and walk into a visualization.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We were imagining ourselves
as enlightened servants

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.940 align:middle line:90%
of the enlightened master.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And on some level,
it was all true.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.990 align:middle line:90%
On some level, it was reality.

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
On some level, it was all play.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%


01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
He said that in order to
create an enlightened society,

01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.020 align:middle line:90%
you have to change the culture.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
change the culture,

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.510 align:middle line:90%
you have to change the art.

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
change the art, you

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
have to change the principles
that art is based on.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And those principles,
he said, should be

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.606 align:middle line:90%
the principles of Dharma Art.

01:02:12.606 --> 01:02:17.880 align:middle line:90%


01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The basic notion of art at
all means how to relate oneself

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:31.495 align:middle line:84%
and how to relate with one's
phenomena world gracefully.

01:02:31.495 --> 01:02:35.230 align:middle line:90%


01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:41.560 align:middle line:10%
Dharma Art, rather than looking
at a painting of a river,

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.905 align:middle line:10%
is more like being in
the water, in the river.

01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:49.020 align:middle line:90%


01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
When there's enough
sense of space,

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
then we can afford
to relax more,

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to find what's
known as the sacred world,

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:02.893 align:middle line:84%
that any artistic endeavor
is regarded as sacred.

01:03:02.893 --> 01:03:06.070 align:middle line:90%


01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:11.868 align:middle line:84%
When that happened,
there is no struggle.

01:03:11.868 --> 01:03:17.870 align:middle line:90%


01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
The idea in Dharma Art
is to receive images.

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not an ego trip.

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%

bring it to the surface.

CHOGYAM TRUNGPA:
Things are sacred,

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
not in a sense of religious
means, but sacred in the sense

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:55.751 align:middle line:84%
that there is a natural dignity
in the way we view our world.

smoking cigarettes.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.780 align:middle line:10%
And someone asked him
a question to talk

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.830 align:middle line:10%
about aggression in America.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:30.491 align:middle line:10%

This was the Dorje Kasung.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.475 align:middle line:10%
It was given that name
because it literally means

01:04:48.475 --> 01:04:53.240 align:middle line:10%
"protecting the sacred space."

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Chogyam Trungpa believe
that every aspect of society

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
had to be explored,
every single aspect.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.000 align:middle line:10%
And so he created
theater groups,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.020 align:middle line:10%
and he created commerce groups.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.240 align:middle line:10%
He created educational
institutions.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And he also created a Buddhist
version of a military.

Everyone had a
hard time with it,

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
but he would say
over and over again,

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
until we reach into the heart
of aggression of society

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and we transmute that
very same energy to be

the forces of peace,
we couldn't really

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:28.870 align:middle line:90%
change the way things worked.

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:31.280 align:middle line:84%

in organizations,

States' presence in Vietnam.

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
What I came to feel was that
those of us who were doing that

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
had, in the end,
no greater insight

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
about the fundamental
problem of aggression

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
than the government
and the Army that we

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.681 align:middle line:90%
were protesting against.

is what is known

as the path of the warrior.

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Here again, it doesn't mean
to say the creator of a war

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:13.071 align:middle line:84%
as warrior, but warrior
in the sense of braveness,

01:06:13.071 --> 01:06:13.770 align:middle line:90%
being brave.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We would drill for
hours in uniform.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, we
would have visitors,

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and one of those visitors
asked him once, why are

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.630 align:middle line:90%
you doing this military thing?

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And his response was that some
day people will see the Dorje

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Kasung marching down a street,
and it will cause them to feel

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
like they want to smile.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we'll
actually have changed something

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
at the core of the
modern society,

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.740 align:middle line:90%
of the problem, as it was.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.055 align:middle line:90%


01:07:00.055 --> 01:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It took us 10 years to
figure out that he was

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
teaching traditional Buddhism.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know that,
because if you ever

01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
read traditional
Buddhism, you go, huh?

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But his incredible ability with
language, to translate that

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
into our language, so that he
was able to touch your heart,

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and he was also able to sort
of make your mind inquisitive.

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So your constant feeling was
that your journey was truly

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
what is traditionally
described as the path is going

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
underneath you and you are
just continually opening up

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
to whatever you
are encountering.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

First time I met Trungpa
Rinpoche, John said, Rinpoche,

01:07:46.315 --> 01:07:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to introduce
you to my wife Agnes.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And Rinpoche looked like
this, and he took my hand,

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.160 align:middle line:10%
and he said, hello.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.450 align:middle line:10%
And then he turned
to John and said,

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:06.250 align:middle line:10%
I find your wife
very attractive.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And I leaped off the floor
and jumped in the back of John

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and looked at Rinpoche over
John's shoulder, thinking,

01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:20.210 align:middle line:90%
what is he talking about?

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:21.492 align:middle line:90%
Or who is this man?

01:08:21.492 --> 01:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%


01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Lots of his students were his
lovers, and that was known.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:34.415 align:middle line:84%
My impression as I sort of
looked at your community

01:08:34.415 --> 01:08:37.260 align:middle line:84%
was that this was like
part of what went on,

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.470 align:middle line:90%
and it was certainly open.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I remember watching
Rinpoche with his entourage,

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and you could just sort see
who was who in the entourage.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Of course, in the Zen world,
things were more hidden,

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.010 align:middle line:10%
I think we could say.

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:56.189 align:middle line:10%
And so the issue there became
more that things were hidden.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:09:09.640 align:middle line:90%


01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.460 align:middle line:90%
He didn't hide anything.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.120 align:middle line:90%
He didn't hide his drinking.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.600 align:middle line:90%
He didn't hide his sexuality.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.799 align:middle line:84%
There's so many Western
teachers, as well as

01:09:18.799 --> 01:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Asian teachers in
the West, who have

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
been brought down by what's
called sexual misconduct.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you really look
closely, that's not

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.060 align:middle line:90%
what caused them to come down.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It was that the students
felt deceived and lied to.

The first time he slept with
somebody after I married him,

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.569 align:middle line:10%
he was still at Samye Ling, and
I was completely freaked out.

01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:39.899 align:middle line:84%
I sat on the floor
of the bathroom

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and just cried all night.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I went
in, and I talked to him

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and told him I was
completely destroyed.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe that
he just married me,

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:48.689 align:middle line:84%
and now maybe I
had to divorce him

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:50.060 align:middle line:90%
because he was sleeping around.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.439 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, it's
not that I don't love you.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship is much, much
stronger and more powerful

01:09:56.610 --> 01:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
than sexual fidelity,
so to speak.

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to be able
to be a conventional husband,

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
but you can always
completely, 100%

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
percent rely on our relationship
and our love for each other.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's just not going
to be conventional.

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:15.620 align:middle line:10%
Sexual activity, what there
was, it was about liberating

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:22.280 align:middle line:10%
desire rather than
creating more desire.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you take
that place of desire

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
where it's the most, which
is in the sexual activity,

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and you apply some
kind of wakefulness,

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
some kind of where
you actually are

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.200 align:middle line:90%
present all the way through.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.185 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very potent
place to work from.

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
I would sit with him

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:50.911 align:middle line:84%
for hours, two, three, four
hours, in almost total silence.

01:10:50.911 --> 01:10:53.425 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it
was really lonely.

01:10:53.425 --> 01:10:58.788 align:middle line:90%


01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:02.540 align:middle line:10%
You know, my husband
Jonathan has always said--

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:07.670 align:middle line:10%
and we were married, so those
weren't easy times for him.

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:13.490 align:middle line:10%
And he's always said, and not
always in an enlightened way,

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:15.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm second to the teacher.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm second to the guru.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.760 align:middle line:10%
I was jealous.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.160 align:middle line:10%
It was much more
of, huh, you're able

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:33.400 align:middle line:10%
to have a special relationship
with him, and I can't.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually calling
it a relationship

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
is even tricky, because
there wasn't that kind

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.450 align:middle line:90%
of solidity to it, really.

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about the
person Trungpa Rinpoche.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But we are talking
about the manifestation

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of that mind, which
sees reality as it is

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.750 align:middle line:90%
and is able to wake people up.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But only because
you share that mind.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:02.490 align:middle line:10%
In the West, it's easy
to misunderstand devotion

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.880 align:middle line:10%
in the Tibetan tradition.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It looks from the outside as
if there's this great, great

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
person and then these
little people falling

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:13.160 align:middle line:90%
at the great person's feet.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the tradition
itself is very clear

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that the teacher has nothing
more than the student,

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
that the wisdom exists already.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.560 align:middle line:90%
We're born with it.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.780 align:middle line:90%
We die with it.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.000 align:middle line:90%
We can't get rid of it.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.070 align:middle line:90%
We can get more of it.

01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The teacher points that out,
and the student gradually

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:39.530 align:middle line:90%
comes to that understanding.

01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:40.625 align:middle line:90%
And the minds meet.

01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:44.950 align:middle line:90%


01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
After being married
to him for 17 years,

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I would still sometimes lie in
bed next to him and look at him

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, I have
no idea who you are.

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was
completely unfathomable.

01:12:55.310 --> 01:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
You could never really
second guess his reaction.
