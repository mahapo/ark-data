It's actually quite simple.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a diet based on eating
over 70% of raw foods,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:84%

I'm Alexa Kahn.

I'm an actor here
in LA, and I am

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:10%
interested in exploring the
raw food movement a little bit

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:10%
further.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
a lot of benefits

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
to choosing a raw food diet.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Right off the bat, you're
eating healthily no matter what

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:90%
you're consuming.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So you're limiting your
options, sure, but they're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.976 align:middle line:90%
all healthy options.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I also have a
gluten intolerance,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
so maybe following a raw
diet, it could remedy that.

BARUCH: I was sick with
asthma for over 20 years.

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I was on medications,
overweight a little bit.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.675 align:middle line:84%
So within a month

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:90%
rid of asthma, lost 30 pounds.

All medications, they're gone.

was really bad.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I had what most people
now would describe

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
as acne rosacea, which is really
redness in the face, which

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
was awful.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And it went away very
shortly thereafter when I got

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%

Yes please.

00:10:41.638 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:10%
One aspect of getting
involved in that cultural

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:10%
was also learning a lot
more about detoxification

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:10%
and cleansing, and I was doing
colonics and herbal tonics.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
For me cleansing is just
giving your body some time

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to not spend so much time
and energy on digestion

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and really about
restoration and detoxifying.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I typically do is I'll
do the first and fifth day

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
of my cleanse will
be just raw foods

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:90%
so lots of salads and fruits.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And then the three days in
between I do just juicing.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
research and people

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
out there who say that
basically what happens

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
is that waste builds
up and it begins

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:90%
to line your intestinal walls.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think about it
that, if you get nutrients

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
through the intestinal walls
and you're releasing toxins,

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
if that's blocked, then what's
happening to that waste?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I was coming off the
cleanse, I was doing a liver,

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.325 align:middle line:84%
gallbladder flush,
and I was feeling

00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the craving the entire
cleanse, Domino's Pizza.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
What it is, is I sat and I
breathed with the openness

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
of driving on and not making
the call, or making the call

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and indulging and
doing it guilt free.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So I called them up,
ordered it, walked in there,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
grabbed the box,
and sat in my car

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
just grinding on this
pizza, just like oh, my god.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Like seriously, cheese and
sauce dripping down my face.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It was so good,
and I didn't feel

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:90%
any ramifications afterwards.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, when you
go from one extreme

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of cleansing to the
extreme of another,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:90%
there's major ramifications.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Because your body is
just going into shock.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
So I was lucky.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:90%

Those parasites that
we cultivate in our body

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.632 align:middle line:84%
is a result of certain diet,
they have consciousness.

00:12:26.632 --> 00:12:28.065 align:middle line:84%
And this consciousness
is the consciousness

00:12:28.065 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
of what you call the
serpents or the snake

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
or the evil inclination,
whatever you want to call it.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you cultivate
that in your stomach,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:90%
they're in control.

bone don't shatter.

eat fruits, vegetables,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.018 align:middle line:90%

Hi.
Alexa.

00:17:00.412 --> 00:17:01.906 align:middle line:84%
-How's it going?
-Nice to meet you.

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:03.898 align:middle line:90%
I've heard a lot about you.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.751 align:middle line:84%
-I hope it it was all good.
-I mean it was.

00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:08.734 align:middle line:84%
-Just a little bit.
-And it looked really good too.

00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:09.644 align:middle line:90%
Yea. yea.

00:17:09.644 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you get a little bit
of social anxiety ever?

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.529 align:middle line:84%
In one of my best
friend's weddings,

00:17:14.529 --> 00:17:17.679 align:middle line:84%
I told them, well, listen, I'm
making this choice to go raw

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:90%
or trying to.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's more supportive,
but he basically

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:90%
was joking but he wasn't.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you will
eat what we provide.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.297 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, OK.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
You just feel like
you know all the things

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that are vegetable in this
menu that you're creating?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I won't make it hard.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Just take those, throw them onto
a plate, cut them up nicely.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.625 align:middle line:84%
Put on some olive oil and
just do something simple.

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You know the essence of
why I'm there is to be

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:90%
with my family and my friends.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Whether I can eat, or
I'm going to eat off

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.775 align:middle line:84%
of what they're eating
and share this or that,

00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't really matter.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
When push comes to
shove, it's really

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:90%
more about like connecting.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.556 align:middle line:84%
MAY: You have to have a
community of people around you,

00:17:55.556 --> 00:17:57.355 align:middle line:84%
and at least there was one
person I knew I could go to

00:17:57.355 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, let's make
this meal together.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think it is a
community kind of effort,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and I think for me it
grew-- it started to become

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:84%
a little cumbersome in terms
of always trying to convert

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.053 align:middle line:84%
people to what I was eating.
-Hey.

00:18:12.053 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.066 align:middle line:90%
Just making a little raw food.

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:90%
What is it like a salad?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:90%
No, we're making gazpacho.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
CHARLIE: So you're just going
to live off vegetable paste

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your life?
ALEXA KAHN: No.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I told you.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.316 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to teach you.

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
This is an easy step.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So I know you were saying you
were looking for healthier diet

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.275 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, easy
to start out with,

00:18:34.275 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and then I have all
these cookbooks,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and we can make something
a little bit more

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
difficult next time.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to cook
more raw food next time.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.356 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't really cook it.

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:43.435 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to prepare it.

00:18:43.435 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So what are they
just blank books or--

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
ALEXA KAHN: I know that
it's hard to explain,

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.771 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
lifestyle change.

00:18:47.771 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Like is raw food
culinary school?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Do they just like-- like--
put you near a bunch of ovens

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.325 align:middle line:84%
and just discipline you
not to turn them on?

00:18:54.325 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.817 align:middle line:84%
That's why I put the plates
over here, because I'm not

00:18:58.817 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
going to be using them anymore.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%

build a barrier.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%

cilantro, lots of flavor

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%

CHARLIE: Sure.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:15.349 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.349 --> 00:19:18.538 align:middle line:84%
-Yea.
-Look at our creation.

00:19:18.538 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:90%
It's like ah-- it's like brown.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
colors in there.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think we're
actually ready.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Will you please get the
avocados ready for garnish?

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.675 align:middle line:84%
Well, cheers to our
first raw meal together.

00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:90%

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%

to a healthy, delicious snack.

ALEXA KAHN: You're welcome.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So you make this, I'll bring
over the chips and the people

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
food, and we'll have a feast.
It's a step.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.212 align:middle line:90%
It's baby steps for me.

00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Yea for me too.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:84%

you're over here and open to

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:90%
it makes me happy.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just keep making
and trying new recipes,

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.761 align:middle line:84%
and if you'll come
over and try it then--

00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're going to
be able to appeal to eaters

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
outside of that core group
is what's going to determine

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.826 align:middle line:90%
whether it grows or not.

00:20:19.826 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's going
to depend on what they're

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:90%
going to put on the plate.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean if they can
put food on the plate

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that you're eating
because you enjoy it,

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:90%
than I think it's going to grow.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.115 align:middle line:84%
But as long as it's food that
you eat because you think

00:20:35.115 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
you ought to, I think that
has a-- that kind of thing

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.510 align:middle line:90%
has a pretty short shelf life.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
People eventually will say, yea,
but I really want a hamburger.

food information,
