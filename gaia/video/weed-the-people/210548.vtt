00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:90%
He didn't feel good.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:84%
They found over 20
tumors in his chest.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:84%
It was very bleak at that
point, and AJ does not

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
know how bleak it was.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
We've never told him that.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:90%
He's a 17-year-old kid.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
He needs to concentrate
on getting better.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Bronto is down for the count.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.145 align:middle line:90%
Hey, survival of the fittest.

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the raw oil form
that we get when we buy it.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> When we started using
it, we had to get a permit.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then we could start actually
getting it from the dealer,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is the right
term-- distributor.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what the correct
term is to not make it look bad

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.480 align:middle line:90%
or sound bad.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheila and AJ get
out and go upstairs.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm driving the
truck in Beverly Hills,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
circling the parking lot,
trying to find a place to park.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I can't even find
a place to park.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.565 align:middle line:90%
She gets in the truck.

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:90%
AJ gets in the truck.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And she's got this
little, teeny bag.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
so what was it?

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And she's crying.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I wish
you could have been there

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:90%
because of all these questions.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK, so let me--

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
What is this stuff?

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And how much did we spend?

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And so she pulls out these two
little syringes that are, like,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.583 align:middle line:90%
10 grams or 10 milliliters.

00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It's supposedly all the
same or something like that.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And there's two of them.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And she goes this was
$1,010 for those two.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like--
[HARD GULP] It's our son.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Tracy.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, so nice to meet you.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So nice to meet you.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, honey, it's my pleasure.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Sophie.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.612 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, Sophie.

00:09:17.612 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>> We just got her
up from her nap.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, she's still waking up.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.435 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:10%
>> She's so aware.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, she is.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, she's--

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:10%
>> She's always been that way.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.728 align:middle line:84%
>> --quite the
special little baby.

00:09:27.728 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of us could imagine
putting our tiny, little baby

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
through chemo.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And the day that we
decided to not do chemo

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
was the day that I felt
like I could breathe again,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure he
would say the same.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just so
counterintuitive to do it.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We got the scans.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Said it was an optic
pathway glioma.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's the core of the
mass sitting right there

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.087 align:middle line:90%
on the optic cross.

00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> These are excellent pictures.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Here-- oh, and this
is only one of them.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And then here.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:90%
This one is of her spine.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Her spine is totally clear, so
it's not metastasized or spread

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And then this--

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the most natural,
normal place for it to go?

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:90%
She has none of that.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Let me just mention this.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't have medical training.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to have
medical training.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I just have something that
I feel is more important,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.293 align:middle line:90%
and that's experience.

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have to experiment.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
There might be times when,
as we're figuring out

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:84%
what her dose is, we might
go, oh, OK, that's too much.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It can't hurt her
if it is too much.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
All it's going to take is
the hours of it getting out

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.992 align:middle line:90%
of her system.

00:10:30.992 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what we love
so much about this is that

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:90%
she's not going to be suffering.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:90%
She's not going to be in pain.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.265 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
watch her deteriorate.

00:10:37.265 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:90%
She's perfect health-wise.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
She's had one cold
in nine months,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's because
Dad gave it to her.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Except for that damn cancer.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Except for that
huge mass in her brain,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:90%
that's the only thing.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So literally, 1,000
stars had to align for us

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to finally change
our mind on cannabis.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:10%
That was the only thing
that we just completely

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:10%
dismissed and refused to
research because we just

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:10%
thought it was so ridiculous.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We looked at
everything else but that.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was all from Facebook.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
One of those mommies
said, look, there's

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of legitimate
science going on around it.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So we started really looking
at this positive research

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
on cannabis, and I said,
honey, this could be it.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.335 align:middle line:90%
So how do we--

00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> With the first time, I'll
just go ahead and do it, OK?

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I'm giving her a tiny,
tiny amount this first time,

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Because she's never
been exposed to this.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you draw back on this
so it doesn't keep pouring out.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Here, let Mama.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.602 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here we go.

00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:41.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Good job.

00:11:41.546 --> 00:11:42.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay.

00:11:42.962 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:90%
High-five, high-five.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.125 align:middle line:90%
Good job, honey.

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Will she feel any of the THC, or
is that CBD going to kind of--

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.917 align:middle line:90%
>> We won't know until she--

00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Until she-- till she--

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody's different.

00:11:53.253 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
If she has her
breakfast at 10:30,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.253 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going
to be giving her

00:11:56.253 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:84%
this until probably 11:30 or
so, and then we don't have time

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:90%
to get three doses in.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So we'll start out at two
doses and see how she does.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we can
wake her up earlier.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:84%
But let's do as little
to disrupt her day.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Two is going to be fine.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.073 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be the--

00:12:10.073 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I know how--

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I've come to learn
over the years

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:90%
that we're not that powerful.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:90%
We can do the best we can.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:90%
We can whatever.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But whatever's going to
happen is going to happen.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.862 align:middle line:90%
We're just not that powerful.

00:12:23.862 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to do
what's best for her.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And I know.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're a wonderful,
wonderful mother,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing an amazing job.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So for now, let's just
start with two a day.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're awfully happy
to be able to help and be part

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:90%
of your journey.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, we're happy to have you.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.435 align:middle line:90%
We really, truly are.

00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how
much this means to us.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.405 align:middle line:90%

She's not moving around as much,

She, as of today, is starting
to get two different oils.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So considering that a
little bit of sleepiness

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.663 align:middle line:84%
is all we're seeing
as a side effect,

00:23:58.663 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd say this has definitely
been a much better alternative

tiny, tiny, little drop.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to give that
to her while she's sleeping.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%

Sophie's medicine.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:10%
on the CAT scan and the MRI.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, ma'am.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what
did they tell you?

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What they normally
do is radiation.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It had to be done right
away because he was already

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to the point where he couldn't
swallow by the time we--

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:84%
like, the first day of
being in the hospital.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And what did they tell
you his prognosis is?

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they suspect six
to nine months of life.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
After that, then it
would be the end.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So they shrunk it to give
him more quality of life.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.563 align:middle line:84%
>> And they had
nothing more to offer.

00:27:13.563 --> 00:27:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so scary.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
In the state of California,
my job as a medical cannabis

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.370 align:middle line:84%
consultant is to
determine whether or not

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
AJ qualifies based on the
law for medical cannabis.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And he does.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
get you the letter.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And everybody
talks about a card.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not a card.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a letter.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And in that letter, I make the
statement that he qualifies

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm approving
him to use it.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard
of stories of some

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of the other patients
that have had

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:84%
brain tumors that are responding
to high-dose cannabis oil.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, ma'am.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There are no guarantees
because I have to tell you,

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:90%
there's no clinical trials.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- oh, I have 10
kids with the same tumor,

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and we studied them, and half
of them got placebo, and half--

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So he's still within two
months of being diagnosed.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's still pretty early, even
though it's a fairly aggressive

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:90%
tumor.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
You're not coming here saying,
they gave us two weeks.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You have some time here,
which is really good.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:90%
There are some side effects.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
They're not like side effects
of chemo, which are devastating.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's, to me, nothing to be
afraid of at this point because

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:90%
for him--

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not to be dramatic about
it, but it's life and death.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not getting
any other options here.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And as a mom myself, I
would do it in a heartbeat,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
knowing what I know and
seeing what I've seen.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, ma'am.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of medicine
are we giving her?

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Turmeric.

00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:48.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Turmeric?

00:28:48.896 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, she didn't
care if it's spicy.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:90%
She's used to it.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, what a brave girl.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.460 align:middle line:90%
She's brave.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And then what else
do you give her?

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I give her black medicine.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you give
the black medicine on?

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Ice cream.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> On ice cream?

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:90%
What kind of ice cream?

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> The good kind.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.975 align:middle line:84%
Watch Julie take
her black medicine.

00:29:14.975 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to give
your baby black meds?

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Make the cancer go away.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I was deathly afraid
when I realized we were

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
on the oncology ward.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:10%
I remember them saying,
you have to wash your hands

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.990 align:middle line:10%
before and after you leave
the rooms because we're

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.680 align:middle line:10%
in the oncology.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:10%
Oncology.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.345 align:middle line:10%
And I was like-- it was,
like, 4:00 in the morning.

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, what
does oncology mean?

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.012 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry if I'm--

00:29:38.012 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this means.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
this is the cancer.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:10%
And then that's when it hit
me that my daughter literally

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:10%
had cancer.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:90%
They sat me down.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
They're like, this is
a 97% curable rate.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:84%
She's going to finish
this treatment.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
She will go on to live
a long, healthy life.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.952 align:middle line:84%
The side effects
are very minimal.

00:29:54.952 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:84%
You have nothing
to worry about it.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Just like us.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you through this.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:84%
She has the best cancer
that you can have.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:90%
So we really did trust them.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> She went through her
six months of chemotherapy.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we went about four
months out of treatment

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
without any evidence
of the disease.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was at work,
and I got a call from Jaclyn

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
saying that she was
breathing weird.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.738 align:middle line:90%
Something wasn't right.

00:30:19.738 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So we took her in
the emergency room,

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and she was diagnosed with
stage 4 complete metastasis.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.895 align:middle line:84%
Her right lung was covered
top to bottom with cancer.

00:30:27.895 --> 00:30:31.223 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.223 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And this time she would
have four medications.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to have two new ones
because, as everyone knows,

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.825 align:middle line:84%
cancer cells, they become
resilient to chemotherapy,

00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:90%
so you have to up it.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.272 align:middle line:90%
It has to be stronger.

00:30:43.272 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>> This one was much more
aggressive and harsh.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And right away, I
mean, we could see her.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just all the life
that was in her was gone.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
She was three and
1/2 and 19 pounds.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't know if
she would survive it.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.770 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't looking
very good for her.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And the hospital
could not guarantee

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:90%
her long-term survival.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we were able to
opt out of treatment,

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:90%
which is very rare.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:90%
It was an unpopular decision.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.618 align:middle line:84%
I personally did not believe
she was going to survive

00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:90%
the next round of chemotherapy.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.872 align:middle line:90%
[SOLEMN MUSIC]

00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I think my worst fear was
obviously losing my daughter

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.420 align:middle line:90%
at home at my own hands.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And my uncle told us
about the cannabis oil.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:90%
He gave me some to try.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I thought it was--

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:90%
I got liquid gold.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I was like, let's go.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So three months after we
opted out, we did a scan.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And the 4.2 was down
to 1.62 millimeters.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And the one that was
slightly over 1 millimeter

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%
was completely gone.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we believe that
it was definitely the cannabis.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Can you give him besos?

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I can honestly tell you
here right now that my daughter

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:84%
would not be alive today
if we had not done it.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe 100% that she is
here because of that, because

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of cannabinoids, and
because of our faith in God.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't doubt that it's
definitely cannabis oil,

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:84%
but we just don't
know what's in it.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean, one of the problems with
it not being regulated and it

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.410 align:middle line:10%
not being controlled is that
you don't know what you're--

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.827 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you just have to trust
that the people that you're

00:32:18.827 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:10%
getting it from are
doing it the right way.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was just a bit concerned
because when I opened this,

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.132 align:middle line:90%
it smelled kind of solventy.

00:32:28.132 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But they said to leave
it out to breathe.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But it would be
interesting to know what

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.938 align:middle line:90%
the components of this were.

00:32:33.938 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be like
that, should it?

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.313 align:middle line:84%
There should be a place
where you can go to,

00:32:37.313 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:90%
and you can get advice.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:84%
You can get it tailored to the
treatment, tailored to this one

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.990 align:middle line:84%
at night, this one
in the morning.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:84%

there's nothing here like

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.427 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, it's a little bit
solventy, but it's not too bad.

00:33:26.427 --> 00:33:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
horribly solventy?

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That smells really--

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
let Jeff smell it.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But it smells very
solventy to me.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's something--
something different.

a little alcohol,

but it smells like rubbing
alcohol, not like ethanol.

00:33:40.497 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That one's worse.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Try that one.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.850 align:middle line:90%
That one stinks.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That one, I thought,
wasn't too bad.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's rubbing alcohol.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.630 align:middle line:90%
That's isopropanol.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.930 align:middle line:90%
You should not be eating that.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:90%
That's no good.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.218 align:middle line:90%
And they do use it.

00:33:52.218 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that is rubbing alcohol.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's rubbing alcohol.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:90%
That's not ethanol.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.555 align:middle line:84%
>> That's not food
grade alcohol.

00:33:57.555 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> That smells
like the alcohol--

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're giving him--

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not that one.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if you've given
him tremendously large amounts

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be concerned
about complete damage.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But it will be more difficult
on the liver to metabolize that,

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:84%
and it could cause
damage to certain cells.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:84%
When they're on chemo and
they're on other medications,

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:90%
the liver is already on--

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty busy.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to
make it work harder.

>> Chico's not
going to-- he's OK.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.090 align:middle line:90%

other travesty. $3,000.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> For those three
tiny little pots.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.795 align:middle line:90%
>> That's disturbing.

00:34:31.795 --> 00:34:32.595 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:34:32.595 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part of what
we do-- because I always

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:84%
have to be the
disseminator of bad news.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
>> --going to let us start
testing it for medicinal

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
purposes, that will help
as well because right now--

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and correct me if I'm wrong--

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.590 align:middle line:84%
they're only allowing
tests to happen

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
that show how it can hurt
you, not how it can help you.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe it was-- yeah, 6%
of the studies are currently

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:84%
funded for good purposes,
and 94% are looking at bad

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The US National Institute
on Drug Abuse, NIDA,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:84%
funds the vast majority
of drug abuse research,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
not just in the United
States but in the world.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The way they encourage
scientists and researchers

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:84%
was all about trying
to identify harms.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Congress, in 1970, placed
marijuana in the Schedule I

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:90%
category--

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:84%
high potential for abuse, no
medical use and treatment.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Marijuana is in the same
category with heroin and LSD.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Cocaine is in a lower
category, Schedule II,

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.860 align:middle line:84%
because it has legitimate
medical uses in some limited

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, we still have
this block of the Schedule I

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:90%
status.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So the federal government
is telling us there's

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:84%
not enough research on
cannabis to de-schedule it

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.130 align:middle line:84%
from Schedule I. And
then they're saying,

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
but we can't do research
because it's Schedule I.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's put us in this
really horrible position.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The DEA is blocking
recognition that this is

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:84%
science on marijuana's
medical efficacy,

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.148 align:middle line:84%
and you just can't be in
the dark about that and say

00:35:58.148 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:84%
there's no currently accepted
medical use and treatment

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and
no standard for safety.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a lie.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The first evidence that
cannabis may have anti-cancer

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:10.730 align:middle line:84%
activity actually came from
our National Cancer Institute

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:90%
in 1974.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But mysteriously, those lines
of investigation disappeared.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I started downloading
studies, like, five years ago.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.560 align:middle line:84%
There were, like, 450 just
on reference breast cancer.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And now there's
maybe 30 on there.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Where'd all those go?

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they go?

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they go off PubMed.gov?

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Why is the government
taking those studies off?

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Luckily, there's research
going on in other countries

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that hopefully it will be
able to use to make a case

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.750 align:middle line:84%
to de-schedule marijuana
in the United States.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:48.132 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.132 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There are no
prescriptions in America.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:90%
There's recommendations.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Doctors aren't allowed
to prescribe cannabis.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%
They're allowed to recommend it.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
In Israel, every
one of the patients

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:90%
is prescribed cannabis.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a federal license.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
a federal license,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.440 align:middle line:90%
the growers grow federally.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:10%
The patients use federally.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:10%
So research that's overseen
by the federal government

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.510 align:middle line:10%
is then being conducted.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:90%
So you don't have that block.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So the research started
here in the '60s.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
We were gifted with
Professor Mechoulam.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:90%
He isolated the cannabinoid THC.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:10%
>> How come morphine had been
isolated from opium 150 years

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:10%
previously, and cocaine had been
isolated from coca leaves 100

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:10%
years previously, and the active
compound in cannabis had never

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.870 align:middle line:10%
been isolated in pure form?

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Its structure was unknown.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was impossible to
do any biological work.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.430 align:middle line:84%
In science, Israel is
a very liberal country.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.930 align:middle line:84%
While in the US it was very
difficult to do cannabis work,

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.865 align:middle line:84%
here we had absolutely
no problems.

00:37:57.865 --> 00:38:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Dedi is the
epitome of science--

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the go by the book, study
for your eight PhDs,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and work on curing
cancer type of guy,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
working with cannabis,
which is unheard of today.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:10%
>> When you put cannabis
extract or THC and CBD,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.710 align:middle line:10%
which are the main
cannabinoids in the extract,

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:10%
it can really kill the cancer
in a way we call apoptosis.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the cells
commit suicide.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in our
body has a checkpoint

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.255 align:middle line:84%
that they are checking
if there is a problem.

00:38:41.255 --> 00:38:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a problem,
they will kill themselves.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:90%
They will commit suicide.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we see, that
cannabis is giving the cancer

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.950 align:middle line:84%
cells back this
ability that they lost.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
In the first row, we can
see colon cancer cell

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:90%
lines growing in the plate.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Every dot like
this is the cells.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
When we're adding
cannabis strain number 3--

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.940 align:middle line:84%
CB3-- we see all the
cells are dying here.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:90%
100% of the cells died here.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:84%
What is even more interesting
in this image, when

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:17.080 align:middle line:84%
we are growing colon cells,
which are not cancer cells,

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're adding strain number
3, nothing has happened.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:84%
When we add the same strain
to the colon cancer cells,

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:90%
they died.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:84%
When we're adding it
to the normal cells,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.260 align:middle line:90%
they are not dying.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not affecting them.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with
strain number 4.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.170 align:middle line:84%
In this image, it's
very important.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.930 align:middle line:84%
We see we're adding
strain number

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:84%
3 and 4 that kill the colon
cancer and the breast cancer.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's not affecting
the prostate cancer.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
understand which materials

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:90%
we have in these strains.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
What are the pattern
of cannabinoids

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and terpene there and
why it's affecting one

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.180 align:middle line:90%
cancer and not the other?

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>> We've been in the field of
cannabis for about 20 years.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We started to do
experiments with cancer cells,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and we were expecting
other results.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:90%
We were doing metabolic studies.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And what we saw was something
completely unexpected.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.410 align:middle line:90%
We were killing cancer cells.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are one of
the first experiments

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.360 align:middle line:90%
we performed with animals.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:90%
We treated immunedeficient mice.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So we injected
glioblastoma human cells

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:84%
underneath the skin, and
we generated these tumors.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And half of the animals were
treated with cannabinoids--

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:90%
in this case, with THC.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other half received
no cannabinoid treatment.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The tumors of these
animals that were not

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.160 align:middle line:84%
treated with cannabinoids
are way bigger

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:90%
than these other tumors.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
More recently, we have been
working on breast cancer.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And here we represent
two more volumes--

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.670 align:middle line:84%
how big the tumors
are as time passes.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:03.110 align:middle line:10%
And this is how tumors that are
not treated with cannabinoids

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:10%
behave.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:90%
They grew.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
THC-treated population.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, they have
less metastases in the lungs,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and they have less tumors per
animal than the control group.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.100 align:middle line:90%
So it works pretty well.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We are also realistic, and
we know that there are many

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:84%
therapies that have
worked finally in mice.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they fail
when they go to humans.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we need
robust clinical trials

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to get to know finally, at
last, whether cannabinoids

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:84%
can be or not anti-tumor
agents in precise patient

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:90%
subpopulations.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, Sophie.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.922 align:middle line:90%
Hi, my love.

00:41:40.922 --> 00:41:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Want to turn that
light on for me?

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, big stretch.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, honey.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.182 align:middle line:90%
>> So today is the big day.

00:41:48.182 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Today is the first
scans that we're

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:84%
going to be getting to see if
what we're doing is working.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to get
a nice nap, Sophie.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, baby doll, you're going
to get to go to sleep really

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:90%
soon.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.317 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to get a
nice little nap, baby girl.

00:42:04.317 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Mixed in with this?

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Like your little pushers,
and then followed by--

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:11.660 align:middle line:90%
which is this.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.500 align:middle line:90%
This is 30 units.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.106 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're headed
home from scan day.

00:42:17.106 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Sophie is very unhappy.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The anesthesia is making
her really, super cranky.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.255 align:middle line:90%
And she's tired.

00:42:23.255 --> 00:42:26.388 align:middle line:84%
And the radiologist said
that she would read them

00:42:26.388 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the
day today, so we're

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.345 align:middle line:84%
hoping to get information
pretty quickly.

00:42:30.345 --> 00:42:32.755 align:middle line:90%

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.562 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
it on speakerphone.

00:42:38.562 --> 00:42:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear me?

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Hi, guys.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.212 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm not sure if you got
a chance to glance at the MRI.

00:42:44.212 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it does
look a little worse

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:90%
than it did back in June.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So that means we got
to start chemo ASAP.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think our trajectory
is unfortunately chemo.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> [VOICE BREAKING] So
when do we have to start?

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think we
can start this week,

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.255 align:middle line:84%
and then we can spend some
time in the office and go over

00:42:59.255 --> 00:43:00.154 align:middle line:90%
everything again.

00:43:00.154 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:90%
[CRYING]

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not smaller.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not stable.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And that means chemo,
which is just--

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.995 align:middle line:84%
it's really, really,
really hard to imagine

00:43:20.995 --> 00:43:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and what that's
going to be like.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.762 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.762 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, here's the good news.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:32.060 align:middle line:84%
We're very, very far away
from where we want to be.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we had her
on this really high dose,

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.477 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't work.

00:43:36.477 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have to play around

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:84%
with it until we
find how Sophie's

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:90%
most comfortable with it.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We're 100% going to keep
using the cannabis moving

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to increase her,
not only just because I believe

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:84%
it will work
alongside the chemo,

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:84%
but it will also counteract
the side effects of the chemo.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
cannabis has failed us.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that we don't
have her dose right.

I bought it from.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:90%

OK.

Here's what I brought.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
is the high THC.

Where's the pain the most?

00:45:05.845 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>> In my stomach and my head.

>> In your head?

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.540 align:middle line:84%
This oil that we
made is different.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a little different.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:84%
It's stronger, and it doesn't
have all that alcohol in it.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:84%
That alcohol could be
burning your stomach, too.

He'd had to have dilaudid

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to manage the pain, and that had
created an opiate dependency.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So they put him onto methadone
to transition him off it.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:38.103 align:middle line:84%
And I fought and
fought and fought

00:53:38.103 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:84%
them putting him on
methadone for months

Finally, I caved in.

And I knew that if I'd just
managed to get him home,

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I could have got him off
the opiates with oxycodone

done it so many times before.

of their mental capacity

get Chico weaned off methadone

00:54:51.532 --> 00:54:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And we did that with
the help of the oil.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.630 align:middle line:84%
We titrated the methadone
down as the oil came up.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And we saw his mental
capacity return

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.360 align:middle line:84%
as the methadone went away,
even though the cannabis

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.390 align:middle line:90%
oil was coming up.

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:07.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm not really taking
very seriously the IQ point

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:07.850 align:middle line:90%
argument.

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:84%

it's a small price to pay.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.480 align:middle line:90%
He was in so much pain.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.960 align:middle line:84%

OxyContin at 6 o'clock

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.330 align:middle line:90%

half.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.460 align:middle line:90%

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.870 align:middle line:90%
You look at what size that is.

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:17.670 align:middle line:90%

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:35.610 align:middle line:90%
He was eating.

>> It was like--

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.560 align:middle line:84%
it was, like, Monday or
Tuesday when we started it.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.790 align:middle line:84%
By Friday, he was taking
one OxyContin all day.

it's good.

>> There are so many people
out there that could use this

improve their lives,

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.595 align:middle line:84%
where they are so far
off from having access.

00:57:01.595 --> 00:57:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime,
they're just

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.580 align:middle line:84%
being fed a steady stream
of pharmaceutical drugs.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:07.620 align:middle line:10%
And year after year,
we see the number

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.140 align:middle line:10%
of people dying from
accidental overdose

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.840 align:middle line:10%
due to pharmaceutical drugs
get higher and higher.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>> It's remarkable when you look
at this explosion of research

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:23.820 align:middle line:10%
studies coming out about the way
in which marijuana is reducing

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.390 align:middle line:10%
the problems with opioids
and other pharmaceuticals.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:10%
>> 80% of the prescription
drugs are made from opiates.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think as the world
learns and understands

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that it's addicted to
heroin, to opiates,

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
world, once over,

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:90%
will learn how to free itself.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:10%
But right now the
science is being blocked,

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.310 align:middle line:10%
and it's being blocked by big
pharma not wanting the science

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:49.230 align:middle line:10%
to succeed.

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In the big picture, the
pharmaceutical industry,

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:84%
which controls the medical
community, it's a big,

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.623 align:middle line:90%
money-driven machine.

00:57:56.623 --> 00:57:57.540 align:middle line:90%
You have these people.

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.160 align:middle line:90%
They're using morphine.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.080 align:middle line:84%
They're using fentanyl--
all these drugs that

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.455 align:middle line:84%
are respiratory
depressants that,

00:58:02.455 --> 00:58:06.900 align:middle line:84%
in themselves, can accidentally
inherently kill you.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But because it's
prescribed by the hospital,

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:84%
because it originates from
our pharmaceutical industry,

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:13.620 align:middle line:90%
it's accepted by society.

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:18.990 align:middle line:10%
And this has this reputation
for recreational use.

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.930 align:middle line:10%
And by technicality, it's
a Schedule I narcotic.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:24.150 align:middle line:10%
It's a little, like
I said, infuriating

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:27.190 align:middle line:10%
because for us, we're using
it to save our child's life.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Cecilia, we got to take
the black medicine, OK?

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.873 align:middle line:90%
And then all by myself--

00:58:36.873 --> 00:58:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.830 align:middle line:84%

Sophie, Sophie, look.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Sophie, look.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:40.150 align:middle line:90%

[CHATTER]

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.860 align:middle line:90%


01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Around three months
into doing this, Dr.

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Storch looks at us and said, he
looks like he's getting better.

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:12.130 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, yeah, he is.

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Another month went by.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And reluctantly, I agreed
to let the scans take place.

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
She looks at us
and says, I don't

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:22.300 align:middle line:90%
know how to tell you this.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.340 align:middle line:90%
But his scan is clear.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
There is no more
tumors in his chest.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Four months, 20 tumors--

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
gone.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:39.050 align:middle line:90%
We do the next scan.

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Clear.

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
The next scan-- clear.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:42.430 align:middle line:90%
The next scan-- clear.

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
She goes, there's no
cancer in him right now.

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:45.910 align:middle line:90%
He's clear.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> April is our magic month.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I call it the magic
month because that's

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
when we're going to stop
chemo totally and then

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.240 align:middle line:90%
just try to see.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.735 align:middle line:84%
If it is the cannabis,
we're going to find out

01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:57.610 align:middle line:90%
right there and then.

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I find out a child has
cancer or something.

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I go straight to the
parent, and I give them

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Goldstein's number.

01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:06.230 align:middle line:90%
And I say, you have to try.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.570 align:middle line:90%
You have to try.

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> She goes straight to
the parent and tells them,

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.820 align:middle line:90%
put your kid on oil.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.490 align:middle line:90%
She just goes, goes, goes.

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I will look at the people and
people that ask me about AJ

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and ask me about
the cannabis oil.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell them,
I honestly don't

01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
know if this will
work for you, but what

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.735 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you is
what it did for my son.

01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:29.100 align:middle line:90%


01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I have over probably 300
pediatric patients using

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
cannabis right now.

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a case report
of a 16-year-old

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
who came to me a year ago April
with a stage 4 osteosarcoma.

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They came in, referred
in by an oncologist,

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
so bravo to her for
sending the patient to me.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.670 align:middle line:10%
He started cannabis
oil in April.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And in July, he had PET scan,
CT, MRI, and a bone scan,

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
all negative for disease,
which is really incredible.

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:57.602 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:57.602 --> 01:06:59.380 align:middle line:90%


01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
He had repeat scans in
November, which were negative.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.970 align:middle line:90%
I called his oncologist.

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:05.270 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what do you think?

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.270 align:middle line:10%
And she said, well,
he should be dead.

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:08.860 align:middle line:90%
I just saw him last week.

01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
His hair's growing back.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.260 align:middle line:90%
He's off chemo.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
He's a little bit
beat up from his three

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.120 align:middle line:90%
years of chemotherapy.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
For about the first eight
months of his treatment,

01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
he was on gemcitabine,
which is, in one study,

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
synergistic with cannabinoids
to increase cancer killing.

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It appears so far that we're
getting some good results.

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I never say "cure" with
cancer because I don't know.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.145 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely say
extension of life.

01:07:34.145 --> 01:07:38.030 align:middle line:90%


01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> First time that
we talked with AJ,

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
he was almost nonverbal because
he had so much inflammation.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Here he was two months
ago, and here he is now.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's him?

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> No more steroids.

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
That's your typical cancer
kid face right there.

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's him now.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:00.670 align:middle line:90%
God, you got to love that.

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
When they went back to
Chicago, fortunately somebody

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
in California was willing
to act as an angel for them.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.560 align:middle line:90%
So we got AJ.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Initially, he was on the
Hindu Kush and the Yummi.

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If he's only on 0.5
right now on that--

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.464 align:middle line:84%
>> The Skunk hasn't come
in yet from our angel.

01:08:19.464 --> 01:08:21.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-oh.

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:23.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to figure that out.

01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
ratio I want him at.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:32.069 align:middle line:84%
I want him to be on the
five-something of THC

01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:33.899 align:middle line:90%
and two-something of the CBD.

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:37.109 align:middle line:84%
I want him to be
on at least 2 to 1.

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Skunk gets here,
we'll get back to that goal.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you have enough right now?

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We're just about
done at this point.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:48.479 align:middle line:84%
>> I would rather that you give
him a little less each dose

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.729 align:middle line:84%
and stretch it out than
risk running out of it.

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:52.529 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:54.247 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is he
doing in school?

01:08:54.247 --> 01:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, my gosh, he's
doing phenomenal.

01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:57.000 align:middle line:90%
He loves going to school.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
He's on grade level
at this point.

01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:03.689 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's on a gram
and a half of cannabis.

01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:04.750 align:middle line:90%
What a rockstar.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:05.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:09.479 align:middle line:84%
He's doing 0.5 at
two times a day

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.479 align:middle line:84%
and was only doing the
one on the THC, which

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:13.740 align:middle line:90%
is not sufficient.

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
When we had that
big CBD shortage,

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
they got some medicine
from somebody else.

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that has a
still is not an oil maker.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that has flowers does
not know what to do with it.

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I get so furious
with the lack of--

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:37.939 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the lack of regulation
and the lack of oversight.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:40.189 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the main
reasons I want it legal

01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is so that we can
start having standards

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and not have it be
the Wild West, which

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%
is just insane right now.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Let me call Tracy.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Where are we right now
on dosing on Sophie?

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Predominantly we're 1 to 1.

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:01.905 align:middle line:84%
What made you decide
to change to 1 to 1?

01:10:01.905 --> 01:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought that was what we
had discussed a while back.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember exactly why
it was we switched to a 1 to 1

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:08.600 align:middle line:90%
because it's been so long ago.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But now she's doing
Charlotte's Web and the THC

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%
that you gave me last.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.733 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
what strain it was.

01:10:16.733 --> 01:10:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- so we can go
to you for everything.

01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So she's not even-- she's
doing Charlotte's Web instead

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.480 align:middle line:90%
of our--

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been predominantly
Charlotte's for a while.

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:28.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

01:10:28.073 --> 01:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Because remember, you
ran out of CBD pills.

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I knew that because
last time I asked you,

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
you told me that she's had
a gram total of two syringes

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
of Charlotte's Web.

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.062 align:middle line:84%
>> She started using
Charlotte's Web in February.

01:10:42.062 --> 01:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your
records and you

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.175 align:middle line:84%
see how much CBD
you've sent me, it

01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been that
much for a while

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
because you guys had
that big shortage.

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So she's not really
our patient anymore.

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
She's just using
one of our products.

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean,
you've trained me well.

01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] We were having success.

01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I knew what I was doing.

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:02.900 align:middle line:90%
I knew I had excellent medicine.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.762 align:middle line:84%
You had trained me how
to take care of her.

01:11:04.762 --> 01:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
How I was taking care
of her was working.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she has her own plants
there, and it's $100 cheaper.

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this last one was only
$204.51 for almost 10 grams.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have a lot
of money right now.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm barely hanging on.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And anywhere I can
save $100, especially

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
if I need to get two or three
syringes, it's a big deal.

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --understand that.

It's not that I don't
trust your medicine

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
or love your medicine
just as much.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It's really a financial thing.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Sophie's doing great, though.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's all that matters.

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
She is just as normal
as any two-year-old.

We went and saw Dr.
Bonni Goldstein today

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
to get her card
renewed, and Bonni just

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
couldn't believe her eyes
at how great she's doing.

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:51.140 align:middle line:90%
All right, take care.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Say hi to everyone for me.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Will do.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Talk to you later.

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye-bye.

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In order for someone
to be our patient,

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
they have to commit to allowing
us to follow them and learn

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
from them.

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason we do this,

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
is so that we can learn
and understand whatever.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:12.230 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is getting
medicine from other places

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and then not taking it the way
that we tell them to take it,

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
they might as well just go
to a dispensary and buy it.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
That's not who an Aunt
Zelda's patient is.

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have to
give considerable thought

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
to whether Sophie
is still our patient

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.670 align:middle line:90%
under these circumstances.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's too bad
because I believe

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Sophie is where she is
because of our protocol

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and our medicine.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.129 align:middle line:90%

This is our big, official

Hi, guys.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.560 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Sophie.

01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Hi, baby.

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:13.722 align:middle line:90%
Oh, goodness.

Did you see your friends?

01:13:18.944 --> 01:13:19.982 align:middle line:90%
Test.

01:13:19.982 --> 01:13:22.190 align:middle line:84%
All right, everybody, we're
going to go ahead and get

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:24.680 align:middle line:90%
started here in just a second.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%
My name is Tracy Ryan.

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:29.360 align:middle line:10%
I am the co-founder
of CannaKids.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So just a quick rundown of
what the site is going to be.

01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:35.250 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, it's a
massive resources section--

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:37.430 align:middle line:84%
so all of the
information that I have

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
learned over the
years, that families

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that have
learned over the years.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.315 align:middle line:84%
Since getting her on
cannabis and using it

01:13:46.315 --> 01:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
alongside Western medicine,
we've almost completely

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
destroyed a tumor that was
never supposed to really shrink.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.450 align:middle line:90%
So little Sophie--

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:56.030 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
So here we go, guys.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
On the screen, we have
the Christmas tree form.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
There are 100 plants
for our patients.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to
tell you, guys,

01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting really
emotional about how

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
everything is kind of
evolving and coming together.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Look at what we're doing.

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going
to change lives.

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And even if we just
saved one child,

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
even if we cure one
kid of epilepsy,

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
we shrink one brain
tumor more than what

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:26.630 align:middle line:90%
we've done with Sophie--

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.710 align:middle line:90%
we've changed the world.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:32.070 align:middle line:90%


01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It's definitely improvement.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.710 align:middle line:90%


01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I couldn't
be more pleased.

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, god.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Night and day, Chico.

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Night and day.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> People double-take, and
it takes them a few seconds

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:47.620 align:middle line:90%
to realize that it's Chico.

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I say, remember Chico,
because it was really tough

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:53.620 align:middle line:90%
on you.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.960 align:middle line:90%
This therapy was really tough.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And we got through it.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You got through it barely,
by the skin of your teeth,

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of help from
a variety of sources.

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And to see him
now, it's terrific.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.270 align:middle line:90%
This is what I live for.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we get a renewal of his
cannabis oil recommendation?

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned it to
Margie the other day

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
because we're still giving
him a small maintenance dose--

01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:23.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they say it helps
prevent relapse, and also,

01:15:26.335 --> 01:15:29.390 align:middle line:90%
it stimulates appetite as well.

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of this
is very new for us.

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
all the answers.

01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But the reality
is we're learning

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and that because of
patients like you, Chico,

01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
our minds are more open
towards these types of things

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
other patients that

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
have derived benefit from
our experience with you.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I
think, very helpful.

01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
There's still a lot
that we don't know.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to say thank
you for being an amazing

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%

such an open mind.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.860 align:middle line:90%

Isn't it?

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.053 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to Dr. Federman?

01:16:09.053 --> 01:16:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you realize you and what
you did has made him change his

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:18.310 align:middle line:90%
mind and change his thinking?

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:19.850 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.
