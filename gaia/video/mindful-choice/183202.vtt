something that shocked me.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up in the morning,
and I'd have quiet time

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:90%
before I went to work.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be drinking coffee
and reading the newspaper,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't there.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I was at work.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I was in fictitious
meetings that, by the way,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
never happened.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And my boss would
ask me a question,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.747 align:middle line:84%
and I'd come up with
a brilliant answer.

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would play
this out in my mind,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking about
the past and the future.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And I realized the vast
majority of my day,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
my body would be right here,
my life would be right here,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:90%
and I was here, or I was here.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.436 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
light bulb went on.

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:57.394 align:middle line:90%

In some part of your lifetime,
there's a point where you say,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
there has to be more
to life than what

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm experiencing here.

you start to look for more.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
The reason you're in this body
is to experience that ongoing--

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that underlying reality
of everything you.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Not to think about it,
not to read about it,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
but to actually move into
a direct experience of it.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with
peace and stillness.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.892 align:middle line:84%
Taste it, experience it, stop
grinding and thinking on it.

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:13.245 align:middle line:84%
You can think about it, think
about it, think about it,

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:15.311 align:middle line:90%
and then you're going to die.

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Or you can say, how
do I bathe in peace

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and absolute pristine
stillness forever.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And how do I do it soon?

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:90%

from here, actually,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
quite a few years ago that I
was skiing with a bunch of mates

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:90%

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:90%

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The surprising thing was
that when I went under,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I just had this
overwhelming sense of peace.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that I was under
the snow, that I was trapped.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't breathe.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:90%
My legs couldn't move.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:90%
My arms couldn't move.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But there was
absolutely no panic.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
It was like this awareness
of this endless ocean

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:90%
of peace and stillness.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
God knows how long I was in
there for, but at some point,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I was thrust out, as
if I was on the leading

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:90%
edge of this avalanche.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.775 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that
the panic kicked in,

00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:32.775 align:middle line:84%
because I was just trying
to suck as much oxygen

00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:90%
in as I could, you know?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
The fear that I'd go
back and the possibility

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:90%
that I could die just--

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that really cranked
up the panic.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And I went back under.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And after a short time,
I was thrust out again.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And the avalanche come
to an abrupt halt.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
When I got out, fortunately,
everyone else was out as well.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
When we regrouped, I
thought, man, you know,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.015 align:middle line:84%
that was an amazing experience
of extended silence and peace.

00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
If I could experience
that under the snow,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:84%
surely I could have it
in my day to day life.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Then I thought, the
only way, I think,

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
practically I can even do this
is to make a lot of money,

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.465 align:middle line:84%
make it quickly, retire
early, and head to a beach.

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:36.265 align:middle line:90%
I made a choice.

00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:90%
I cranked it up.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I was already in business, but
I moved it up to the next level.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But what I actually
found was that I

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
was moving further away
from what I was after.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I started to experience more
worry, more stress, more

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:90%
frustration.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I developed a habit
of insomnia at night.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I looked in the mirror
and just was like, mate,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:90%
You look so unhappy.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I've
got to change this.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I've got to change my
paradigm, if you like.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But life just kept
throwing big things at me.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:90%
My wife and I separated.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Not that much later,
I was diagnosed

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:84%
with a tumor inside
my head that required

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%
six weeks of radiotherapy.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.278 align:middle line:84%

ongoing series of events,

00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
as if they were
trying to wake me up.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%

get on with the job.

a truck like spinning the wheel,
like [makes noise], you know?

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So I just ran back to the
place that all the fighting

But he was unable to
talk, because the bullets

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
went through those lungs.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
When I look into
his eyes-- well,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the most
amazing experience I ever had.

everything.

And then, suddenly
he died in my arm.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%

feeling of destiny, the feeling

of love, the feeling of
consciousness, really--

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.732 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was even a
million times stronger

00:12:52.732 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:90%
than the experience of death.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
That was more shocking,
because I was like, how come--

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.833 align:middle line:84%
how come I can see this
potential love, or destiny,

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
or divine destiny,
actually-- like

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I just put that word-- the
divine destiny be stronger

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
than the passing
away of a loved one.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:84%

was when I was about
25, I'd had a son.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided that that way
of life wasn't going to work,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
because I understood
the responsibilities

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I quit everything, and I
decided to work full time

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.065 align:middle line:84%
and get back into a normal
life, as far as what

00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I could remember one was.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But it never really
seemed enough for me.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%

for being very happy.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%

needed to experience

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that fullness,
that connectedness,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:90%

do it through drugs.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So I looked into the success
of rehabilitation and therapy.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that the
rehabilitation unit I was in

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
had been going
for like 10 years.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And the success rate
was 2% of all the people

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:90%
who came through.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:84%
What I found amazing was
the statistics the people

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
who don't bother going through
rehabilitation-- for them who

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%

itself made so many other things

I was quite shocked,
because, actually,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.468 align:middle line:84%
the point at which I
learned to meditate,

00:27:17.468 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I was grinding my teeth--
breaking teeth at night.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I never woke up
feeling refreshed.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted.

children, trying

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to be the perfect mother,
the perfect housewife,

the perfect neighbor,
the perfect teacher,

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.680 align:middle line:84%
the perfect
everything, you know?

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I used to describe
the experience

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.998 align:middle line:90%
as meeting myself coming back.

00:27:36.998 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, going round in
ever decreasing circles.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Once I heard the explanation
and the background

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
for what meditation
is-- because,

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
really, this is the area
that meditation addresses.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:84%
We're living all the
time in the past.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I recognized how many times
I rehashed conversations

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.375 align:middle line:84%
with people to try
and get it right.

00:27:58.375 --> 00:27:59.989 align:middle line:90%
It's like madness, isn't it?

00:27:59.989 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:84%
For the last 12, 13
years, I've had cancer.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.442 align:middle line:90%
It started as breast cancer.

00:28:11.442 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Now I've had treatment.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:90%
It's slowly developed.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I now have secondaries
in the liver and in my spine.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, thanks very much to
the meditation skills that

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I've learned, just being
able to accept everything--

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
even something as extreme
and challenging as that--

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
has enabled me just to be
fully present now and back

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:90%
to this moment again and again.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's a very
simple thing, meditation.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:84%
It just allows you to live open
and allowing in this moment.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
That has been
absolutely key to my

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
being able to live joyfully
and peacefully no matter

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.590 align:middle line:90%
what's happening to the body.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, my body's going
to do what it's going to do.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I can take a lot of actions, a
lot of strategies to assist it.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
I'm not in control.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we call
stress is because we think

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:84%
we're in control, and we think
we know what's going to happen,

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And we find that distressing,
or frustrating, or annoying,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
or painful, or whatever,
because we're resisting what is.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:90%
I worked less.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I actually developed
a new relationship.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And I found I recreated the same
dynamic I had in my marriage,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
where I was just so judgmental
the relationship failed.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was overwhelmed with
a sense of loss, you know?

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.625 align:middle line:84%
Bitching and moaning
all the way through it.

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But once she's gone, the
whiny voice in my head

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:90%
couldn't deal with it.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I got to see that I need some
way to let go of that judgment

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and let people be who
they are, rather than me

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.987 align:middle line:84%
trying to control or want them
to be something different.

00:30:37.987 --> 00:30:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
That was the major catalyst for
me to commit to myself 100%--

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
just to go for that piece,
go for their internal love.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I had to establish
that before I was

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
able to get close to having
a relationship again.

trying to control
everything in my life.

And I didn't want
to do it anymore.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what to do, really.

The great thing, too,
about going out with Greg

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:84%
was that that showed
me how dysfunctional I

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:90%
was in a relationship.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted that to change.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Like, I did.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw that I was
very close to love.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I was very afraid of love.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.145 align:middle line:84%
I suppose my little subconscious
mantra was that love hurts.

Don't let someone
get too close to you,

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
because you might lose
them or it'll just

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:90%
hurt if they reject you.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:84%

that came from my brother

9 or 10 years old.

still feeling that
connection to everything,

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.475 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly, it was like
life was turned upside down.

00:32:00.475 --> 00:32:02.980 align:middle line:84%

life isn't safe.

had my first taste of

happens, you want more.

got more during that era

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.690 align:middle line:84%
was to smoke, or
take psychedelics,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
or anything that we could do

that state with no drugs.

very, very quickly,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%

it was accessible.

different with this particular

practice was that
it was something

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:84%
that I could do with my eyes
open as well as my eyes closed.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It had a huge effect
on me creatively,

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
because it was hit and

when I was writing.

Sometimes I'd be
listening to the voices

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:84%

never a good thing to do.

I don't think the voices
in any of our heads

are ever saying kind things.

They're always saying
really mean things.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to a couple who were talking
to each other the way

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:84%
my mind talks to me, I would
get up and leave the restaurant.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:84%
When you're creating, you
want to be in that flow.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole goal.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why you do it,
because that's the rush.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the fun.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But the minute those voices
start, they just pull you out.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.610 align:middle line:90%
So all of a sudden, here I was.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a tool that allowed
me to return to that flow

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:84%
so that I could look at the page
after I'd been working and go,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:90%
What a surprise.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:90%
That is so amazing.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And know with every inch of
my being that I didn't do it.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:90%
And that is-- that's gold.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:90%
That is just gold.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The practice allowed me to
return to the state, which

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.880 align:middle line:90%
is only presence.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not what
I thought, especially

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:84%

practice on top of belief

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:90%

It was just about being so
fully present that I was here.

And it's the path that
most humans are on.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a path that, if
you're looking at a mountain

mountain to experience oneness,

And it just keeps going,
and going, and going.

I want to experience everything.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:84%

wholeness, completeness.

it's not a comfortable path.

It is the funniest thing.

00:48:21.907 --> 00:48:24.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called the path of comfort,
not because it's comfortable,

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.546 align:middle line:84%
because most of
humanity's on it,

00:48:25.546 --> 00:48:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and they're not comfortable.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's called the path of
comfort because the decisions

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
we make on that
path are decisions

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're comfortable with.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.170 align:middle line:90%
They don't push us.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.108 align:middle line:90%
They don't stretch us.

00:48:38.108 --> 00:48:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a comfortable
path, but there's

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.858 align:middle line:90%
no growth in that path.

00:48:40.858 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
growth is so slow.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a point
where you say, there

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:51.863 align:middle line:84%

what I'm experiencing here.

that you're very blessed,

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:84%
because you start
to look for more.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, very quickly if
you have passion towards that,

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.520 align:middle line:84%
you start to move towards
the path of heroes.

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.750 align:middle line:84%
actually tried to kidnap and
killed my dad probably is--

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.168 align:middle line:84%
might be sitting
here in this room.

00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And everybody just like--

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.420 align:middle line:90%
not easy.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And they pay attention.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And I share with them
what I went through,

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.600 align:middle line:84%
what have I discover,
and why am I

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:84%
doing what I'm doing right now
to help people to find peace,

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.079 align:middle line:90%
no matter the background.

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.635 align:middle line:84%
When I think about my
dad and that experience,

00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:19.010 align:middle line:84%
the greatest gift
that experience

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.200 align:middle line:84%
gave me was to
look for something

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:90%
that would give me peace.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And probably now I feel my dad
closer than when I was a kid

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.313 align:middle line:90%
and I was unconscious.

00:50:28.313 --> 00:50:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It's tricky to say, because
I don't experience my dad

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:47.400 align:middle line:84%
as a human being with
a body, with a mind,

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.620 align:middle line:90%
with a personality.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I experience my dad everywhere
all the time, as love,

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.500 align:middle line:90%
as presence.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.255 align:middle line:90%
In many, many locations.

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> As improbable as it was
that I was going to find peace,

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I was in a cafe, and there was
a brochure on the wall that was

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.150 align:middle line:90%
promoting a meditation course.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And the brochure
said, ascension as

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:84%
taught by the Ishayas
of the bright path.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, mate, what
the hell is this, you know?

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.050 align:middle line:90%
It's wacky.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But what they were
saying resonated with me.

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It resonated with me
with the experience

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I had had in the avalanche.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And it also-- it
resonated with me, which--

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that I realized I needed to find
that peace and love within me.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.750 align:middle line:90%


00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they
asked was, what's

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the one thing you want more than
absolutely anything in life.

00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:00.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.520 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever asked me that
question, but it was obvious.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I wanted peace.

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.850 align:middle line:90%
I wanted unbroken peace.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to experience love--

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.440 align:middle line:84%
love within myself
and the ability

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to love someone else
unconditionally.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be happy.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Not just moments of happiness,
but I wanted it all the time.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And the surprising
thing for me was

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:27.680 align:middle line:84%
that all the other participants
wanted exactly the same thing.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:37.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful thing was that all
the negative aspects of my life

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:90%
fell away.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I was sleeping much better.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:50.830 align:middle line:84%
My frustration and my stress
fell away very quickly.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to use these
techniques with my eyes open.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd been given a
tool that allowed

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:03.250 align:middle line:84%
me to disengage the chatter
in my head and reveal peace.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was
onto the right thing.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Greg suggested I learn
some meditation techniques.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Meditation wasn't
something I did.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was for
hippies and not for me.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, I have--
there's nothing to lose.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.707 align:middle line:84%
I might as well go along
and see what this is about.

00:53:20.707 --> 00:53:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:84%
What I found was
that I'd been looking

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.740 align:middle line:84%
for all those wonderful things
in life in the wrong places.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, the person I'm
with should make me happy.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:90%
My job should make me happy.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't take any
ownership for my own happiness.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And once I started to do
that and use these techniques

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to rest inward, that's
where I found that it

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.780 align:middle line:90%
started to reveal the real me.

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the real
me was happy, was joyous,

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:57.660 align:middle line:90%
was free to live fully.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:13.820 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of us
making this documentary

00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:19.790 align:middle line:84%
is to show people that peace
is possible and very much

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to show them that it's
a personal choice.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
If peace is possible
for the individual,

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:27.380 align:middle line:84%
then we want to show that
it is possible for a group.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And if that's
possible, then it could

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:90%
be possible for countries.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It could be possible
for humanity as a whole.

00:54:33.830 --> 00:55:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two
institutions in town.

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.235 align:middle line:84%
We started about 20
years ago with the idea

00:55:06.235 --> 00:55:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of provide boys between the age
six, seven to 21, 22 years old

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.280 align:middle line:84%
a possibility of becoming
somebody in life-- to provide

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.500 align:middle line:90%
them with a future.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They have families, of course--
all of them or most of them.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But in all cases, they have
either a father in jail,

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:28.960 align:middle line:84%
they have a mother with
prostitution problems,

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.440 align:middle line:84%
with addiction
problems, you name it.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is
instead of having

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.160 align:middle line:84%
these kids in the streets,
to provide them with a home--

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.650 align:middle line:84%
a place for them to
stay, a place where

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:41.620 align:middle line:84%
they can be safe, where
they can attend school,

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.920 align:middle line:84%
to give this kids a chance of
being somebody in the future.

They also have different
ways to fix their problems.

They are more in peace.

We can feel it.

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have a different way to
talk, a different way to play,

a different way to do
all the things we do here
