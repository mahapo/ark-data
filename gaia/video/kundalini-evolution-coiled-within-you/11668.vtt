00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:16.932 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.932 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And at times, the color and
the light would be so intense.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:10%
And it was like
bubbling up in my head.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:10%
It was like this golden light.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:10%
It was just exploding.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And I had to put a lid on it.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It felt like if I had
laughed at that point

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.825 align:middle line:84%
or if I even giggled,
I would have exploded.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I started to feel
this rising sensation.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And it started rising,
rising, rising, almost

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:90%
like in the elevator feeling.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:10%
And then all of a sudden,
I could see this tiny hole.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And it was like my consciousness
was being drawn into that.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
burst into the universe.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And everything was vibrating.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was vibrating.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:90%
And so I closed my eyes again.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
to happen again.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Kundalini is
spiritual energy,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the energy of consciousness,
which is thought to reside

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.240 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the spine
of every human body.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And when aroused, it brings
new states of consciousness,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
including mystical
illumination, exalted

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
powers, ecstasy, bliss,
clairvoyance, healing,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
and transcendence of self.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
universe is energy.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
This source of energy,
when utilized properly,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
can end suffering,
increase health,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
bring blissful experiences,
loving relationships,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual and psychic gifts.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So we are just a microcosm
of that supreme energy.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a super intelligent
life energy everywhere,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
of which we are all a part,
which acts in all of us.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It has an intelligence
or consciousness

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that is beyond what at the
moment we can perceive.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Kundalini is the source of
power that the world's most

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
beloved artists,
composers, poets,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and writers may
have tapped into.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Many philosophers harnessed
this power within.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Many, many people
have had that experience,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
myself as well, of this
living sense and experience

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of the energy manifesting as
this scintillating blue light.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Changes, however,
are not always easy.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And as we undergo
this transformation,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
we may experience much
phenomena unfamiliar to us.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are wonderful,
some can be terrifying.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Spontaneous awakening
of kundalini

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:84%
can be dangerous due to
a lack of understanding.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And if the body is
not attuned to allow

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
the flow of this
supreme energetic force,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
it can cause mental
and emotional imbalance

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and physical discomfort.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Why is information
about kundalini

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
not spread to the
mainstream yet?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
What is needed to recognize
this power within you?

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
This secret has been kept
hidden for centuries.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.295 align:middle line:84%
However, kundalini is
within every human,

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
a resource of energy
that when fully awakened,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
allows us to reach our full
potential with joy, peace,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I had an injury
to my lower back.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The third vertebrae
was herniated.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Herniated disk, I should
say, during a ski accident

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:90%
back in 1993.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And I had this hot flash
just right up my spine.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't result in any
hospitalization or anything

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
of that nature.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up having to go
to physical therapy for quite

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:90%
some time.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And about three
weeks after that,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I started having an incredible
amount of emotional upheavals

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:90%
starting within me.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And it started just basically
deconstructing my life.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I was just overcome by an
overwhelming sense of sadness.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.414 align:middle line:90%
Nothing meant anything anymore.

00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I remained in that
state for probably

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
about two years,
during which time

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing a psychiatrist,
who decided that medication was

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the best route to take,
which didn't help anything,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and actually made things worse.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I impacted it,
just a pulse of energy,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:90%
it felt really incredibly hot.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:90%
It just raised up.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel it enter
into my head or anything,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
but it just raised up the
spine and then stopped.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And my back was hot
for days after that.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:41.038 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1975, I had a near-death
experience after 5 and 1/2

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:10%
hours of spinal surgery and
waking up in a Stryker framed

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:10%
circle bed.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
About three days
after surgery, I

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
remember waking up and
having this huge belly.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:90%
My whole body had swelled up.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:90%
I had developed an ileus.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:10%
But people were
rushing in with carts,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:10%
with bottles, and
machinery, and tubes

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:10%
and hooking me up to
all kinds of stuff.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:10%
And I remember I
was so terrified

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.857 align:middle line:10%
that I just blanked out.

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew--
and I have to tell you

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I was an atheist at this point.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I considered myself a very
sophisticated atheist.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I had been abused a lot as a
child, which had really just

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:90%
turned me off, and I was numb.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up out
in the hallway.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
middle of the night.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and down the
hall, and I didn't see anybody.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that
the lights were dim,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and there was nobody around
in the hospital hallway.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if
they catch me out here,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get into
trouble because I'm supposed

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
to be suspended in their bed.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So I turned around to
come back into the room.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking directly
into a PA speaker.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.644 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew that PA speaker
was mounted on the ceiling.

00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I realized
something was wrong,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:90%
something was up.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And it was me.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:90%
I was up at the ceiling.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And I came back into the room.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down into the
circle bed, and I saw her.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:84%
She had tape wrapped
around her nose

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to hold the tube down my
throat, and to my stomach.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And they had all
kinds of bags hanging.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her, and
it certainly wasn't me.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The part of me that was
looking at her, that was me.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed like that
for a little while.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking that this

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
was the first time in my life
I had felt peaceful, that I

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
felt calm and peaceful.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And as I connected
with that, I started

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
moving through
something very dark

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't call a
tunnel for years, not

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:90%
until I became a researcher.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, yeah, I guess
tunnel is the best word for it.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
But again, words can't really
explain the actual experience.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But I'm moving through
something that's very dark.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm studying
what I'm seeing.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing light
turning in the darkness.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like the total darkness
was bringing light out of it,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
or the light was coming
out of the darkness.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was moving ahead of me.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I was watching
this, I felt these arms

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
come around me, and
embrace me, and pull me

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
into this lush warmth.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was my grandmother.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:90%
I called her Bubbe.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
My Bubbe had been
dead for 14 years.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had never once thought of
her existing beyond her death.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was not
anything I believed.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I was with her.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And she held me.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And together, we
re-experienced the 19 years

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:90%
we were together on this planet.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't just experience
it from my perceptions.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I experienced it from hers.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I could see everything
she was seeing.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I could feel everything
she was feeling.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had every
thought that she had.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.975 align:middle line:84%
So together, what
we were doing was

00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
showing each other how much
love we had given each other.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was my grandmother who
was giving me the attention

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:90%
that I needed.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't getting
it from my parents.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And this went on until
we got to the point

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
where she had passed away.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched her dying, I
started moving away from her.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But it was OK that I was moving
away from her because I knew

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that there were these
transmissions between us

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
with no words but
heart to heart.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I knew she'd always be
waiting for me in that tunnel.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I was back in
my body, back in the bed.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to tell some people
that came in on the health care

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.972 align:middle line:90%
team that I left the bed.

00:10:14.972 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell them
what I just told

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
you, what took me a long
time to find words for it.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But I did tell them
I left the bed.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And they kept telling
me it was impossible,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't leave the
bed, that I had hallucinated.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And the more I would protest,
the more they would sedate me.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Symptoms of out-of-body
experiences, or OBEs,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and kundalini are close first
cousins and may eventually lead

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:90%
from one to the other.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
In the OBE, a person
can learn that they are

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:90%
more than their physical body.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
They may learn of multiple
planes of existence

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and of multiple expressions
of consciousness.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
With kundalini, a person can
learn all of these things

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and in addition,
the implications

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
of a conscious form
of physical divinity

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.985 align:middle line:84%
residing inside an
unlimited yet physical body.

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And a year after
the physical therapy,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I realized I couldn't go back
to being the way I was before.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we had a swimming pool.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:90%
We had an airplane.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
We had everything imaginable
materialistically.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And it just was so
hollow for me now.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I loved my three kids, I still
did brownies and Cub Scouts.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't go back
to the way I was before.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I went back to
the hospital where I had been,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and I started working
in the emergency

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:90%
room just as a volunteer.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But if people were brought in,
I would know if they were dying.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.949 align:middle line:84%
And I would just touch
them or hold their hands.

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And when this would
happen, the staff

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
knew they didn't have to
send me to do anything else.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't ask
me to run errands.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.494 align:middle line:84%
I'd be sitting
there for an hour,

00:11:55.494 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
holding somebody's
hand who was dying.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And that felt so good.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the kundalini
symptoms started happening.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I would get so
excited that I was

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
going to go into the hospital
to work, which started off being

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:90%
one day, and then three days.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.808 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized I
had to go back to school.

00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:13.361 align:middle line:84%
But I would get so excited,
I would get a migraine.

00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
couldn't find anything wrong

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:90%
with my brain.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:90%
I had an EEG, all that stuff.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I would
get my hands on somebody

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
who was dying, I could feel my
headache draining down my arms.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And it would come
out through my palms.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Not pain anymore,
but a tingling.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Kundalini is a natural
part of being human.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
It is an aspect
of the human being

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that works like an electrical
capacitor to a small degree.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
When a certain amount
of energy or a condition

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
warrants its release
into the body,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
an extreme
transformation ensues.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful energy
that isn't electrical

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:90%
will release into the body.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
This can be triggered
by an accident

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to the tailbone, or by extreme
meditation, or extreme prayer,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:90%
or by severe emotional duress.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It can also be activated
by practices intended

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
for its release or by a person
who has it already flowing

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:90%
strongly within.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is a Sanskrit
word meaning "coiled up."

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There are many other names
for this energy from almost

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:90%
every culture on Earth--

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Greater Kan and Li
from China, Holy Fire

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
from the Christian mystics,
Lung of the Tibetans,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Tummo Fire of the
Buddhists, and Sufi latifahs

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
infused with zikr in Islam.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years,
kundalini experiences

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
have been described in the
esoteric teachings of Hindus,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians, Tibetans, Chinese,
Native Americans, shamans,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:90%
the Bushmen of Africa.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Hindu
yoga practitioners

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
kept a concise and detailed
map of the symptomology

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:90%
of kundalini.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And as soon as we come out of
the womb, we start being told--

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
you're my son, you're going to
be this; you're my daughter,

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:90%
you're going to do that.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
You're a girl, you can't
do this; you're a boy,

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:90%
you better not do that.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Layer upon layer upon
layer of identity.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Layer upon layer that has
to be shed in order for us

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to come back to knowing
what our real nature is.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's what kundalini does.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:10%
>> The science of yoga
describes, in a sense,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:10%
the cycle of a soul's
journey across many lifetimes

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.200 align:middle line:10%
as having, in a sense,
two components of it.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:10%
One is called sovereignty.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.211 align:middle line:10%
It's the taking on of forms.

00:14:51.211 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:10%
It's the soul that's just
looking for more experience,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:10%
pursue desires, all
these kinds of things.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:10%
And that builds more
karmas and more things

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:10%
you have to do, and on,
and on, and on like that.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
At some point, the soul goes,
this game is kind of tiresome.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:10%
There's just so much pleasure
to be had through the senses,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:10%
through relationships, through
consuming this or that.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I vaguely remember being a part
of something huge, and whole,

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and complete, and full that
didn't require anything

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:90%
to come in.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When we had a bit of a longer
meditation session is when I

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:90%
had this experience.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:10%
And once I started
to meditate, then I

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:10%
felt in the solar plexus area
a turning sensation and pain.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I thought, you
know, am I going to be ill?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
only action, you

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
know, other than
normal digestion,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:90%
that I really ever had.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was kind
of rocking a little bit back

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and forth.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, there
was this explosion of light,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:90%
inner light.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And with my eyes
closed, I could see over

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
my head what I perceived
as the Star of David.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wasn't from
the Jewish tradition.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was surprised, to be
honest with you, by that.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the same moment that
that light came up to my head

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that star,
I heard the words

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:90%
"All men are created equal."

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I was walking
home at the end of the session,

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I could see me coming toward me.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
just saw myself.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily
totally as I look,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:84%
but just brighter, with a
little bit of light interwoven

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:90%
in the features, and so on.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't scared, it
didn't bother me.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I just thought to myself,
well, I've finally met myself.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, in
eastern traditions,

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
kundalini is seen
as the goddess.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's a form of
the divine feminine.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Hindu
tradition, kundalini Shakti were

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.800 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine energy
who resides at the base

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
of the spine in
the first chakra,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
slowly makes her ascent up
the spine when she has been

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:90%
awakened.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Her role as divine energy is
to travel to the crown chakra

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the head to
unite with her beloved Shiva,

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the divine masculine energy
or pure consciousness,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
who is inert until the
sacred circuit is completed.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Shakti's duty is to
purify the individual

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
in the soul body, physical
body, mental body,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
psychological body,
emotional body

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
as she ascends, giving us
her blessings to evolve

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:90%
to our maximum potential.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini nourishes the
Tree of Life within us

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and is coiled up like a serpent.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it is
called the "serpent power."

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Christians called it a
reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament symbol becomes
significant in Christianity

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
when Christ suggests
kundalini awakening.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
"And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness,

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:84%
even as the Son of
Man be lifted up,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that whosoever believeth
in Him should not

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:90%
perish but have eternal life."

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The caduceus held by
Roman god Mercury,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
with one or two coiled serpents
entwined around the staff,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
represents kundalini
which rises along

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
the central subtle channel
in a spiral movement.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
The Lord Buddha spoke of the
middle path to achieve nirvana.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
He was actually describing
the central channel, sushumna,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
through which the kundalini
ascends from the root chakra

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to the crown chakra.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
In the Holy Quran,
prophet Muhammad Sahib

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
talked of the day
of resurrection,

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
when he says that the
"hands will speak."

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
When kundalini
awakening occurs, a flow

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of energy in the form of cool
vibrations from the hands

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is experienced, and
the various chakras

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:84%
can be felt on parts of
the hands and fingers.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Shekinah, the radiance of
God, is the Hebrew concept

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:90%
of kundalini Shakti.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It is a feminine Hebrew
word meaning the "dwelling"

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
or "settling" and is used to
denote the dwelling or settling

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:90%
presence of God.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I dived pretty deep into
heavy drinking and drug use.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was more to
nullify the emotional pain.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make things better,
it made things much worse,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
brought up a lot more
negativity within myself.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I think circumstances are being
developed behind the scenes

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
to move us apart.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, my life has
been incredibly hard.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want nothing more than
a connection with the divine.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And my current partner
doesn't agree that that's

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:90%
what life is for, you know.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> From there, my marriage
was falling apart.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
My husband really wanted me to
go back to being the way I was.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the way I was meant
I had to go back on Valium

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:90%
to suppress who I was.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't willing anymore.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:84%
My soul was coming out, and
I wasn't putting it back

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:90%
in and pushing it down.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
We started dating when
I was 14 and he was 17.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We were going
steady at 14 and 17.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:10%
And he wanted me to go back to
the way I was when I was 14.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And like I said, that
meant a lot of Valium.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to grow,
I wanted to change.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.840 align:middle line:90%
And change was the dirty word.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So we just went further, and
further, and further apart.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:84%
My parents could not
figure me out at all.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, they stood
way off in a distance

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and looked at me like, who
is she, I don't know her.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I really couldn't find
any blood relatives

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that I could commune
with anymore.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:90%
And that was very sad.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
My friends, I have none of
the friends I had back then.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
My husband still does,
they're still together.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
didn't happen overnight.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It took me nine years
to say I need a divorce.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I kept trying,
and trying, and trying.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like I knew from
that experience the way

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to be.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And I just kept wanting--

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I just kept trying to tell them
the way it's supposed to be.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And nobody wants to hear that.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.444 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had the
experience I've had.

00:22:39.444 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to keep
going the way it is.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was really,
really, really distant.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why I went back
to school and became

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:90%
a respiratory therapist.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Because then I could
work with dying people.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you're working
with dying people,

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:90%
there is such honesty.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to die to the ego.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:90%
And ego dies in surrender.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not a literal death,
it's an absolute surrender.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So that the ordinary
ego mind that

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:84%
seems to master, and control,
and boss us around, and drive

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
is to buy this, own that, have
this, go out with this person,

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
we have to die to
that in a certain way.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> People understand the
normal sequential development

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And you can't short-circuit
this development sequence

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.471 align:middle line:10%
because it won't work.

00:23:28.471 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:10%
And that's reason
why some people go

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.197 align:middle line:10%
through a partial awakening,
and then it goes away.

00:23:34.197 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll go through
an awakening, and then

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
you see their ego

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
get real big as they start to
"look what experience I had."

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That happens in so many
spiritual traditions and types

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
of transformative experience.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:90%
We finally let go of the ego.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
flooded with grace,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and total transformation
can occur.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The three steps are--

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
dependency, which is
when a child is born,

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
they have surrendered their
authority to the parent.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
They are totally
dependent on the parent.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
That then decreases,
and then the child

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
develops self-identity,
which I joke right in here

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
as the 16-year-old hired the
16-year-old while they still

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:90%
know-it-all.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Then they have self-identity
or self-worship,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:90%
the "look who I am."

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they think they
are in control.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They are not dependent
on someone else.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Then is the next
transition phase,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
which is the diminishing of
the ego or midlife crisis.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
This is when bad
things start to happen.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And the ego says, wait a
minute, if I were in control,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:90%
bad things wouldn't happen.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is the beginning of
the diminishing of the self.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, as self diminishes,
as it comes down here,

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
this period right in
here, this transition,

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
would be the "dark
night of the soul."

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
The dark night of the soul
is when the self is empty.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And in Christianity,
that's when Paul

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:90%
talked about the "dying daily."

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the self must die.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
if you're full of yourself,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.530 align:middle line:90%
you have no room for the divine.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So that just as
validation is what

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
helps a person build
their self-identity,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
love is what helps a person
build their divine identity.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
A soul must go
through this sequence.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason that near-death
experiences accelerate

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
the process so much is
because it instantaneously

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:90%
destroys the ego.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It creates an
instantaneous surrender.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So once you've gone through
that instantaneous surrender,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you can experience
God immediately.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Gopi Krishna, born in 1903
near Kashmir in northern India

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first people
to popularize the concept

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
of kundalini among
Western readers.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He was a government
office clerk and practiced

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
prolonged meditations
for a number of years.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
In 1937, at the age of 34,
while meditating one morning,

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
he experienced the sudden
and forceful awakening

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:90%
of kundalini.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he was meditating.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
He had taken up the practice
of meditation in his own life.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:10%
And I think he was
doing it, as far

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:10%
as I understand, without
the help of a guru,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:10%
on a regular basis.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.770 align:middle line:10%
He was extremely
dedicated to the practice.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:10%
He meditated
faithfully every day

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:10%
for 17 years, including, as
he said, his wedding night.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So he knew his wife was going to
be very understanding and very

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:90%
supportive.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:10%
>> One day in winter, about
the time of Christmas,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:10%
I was meditating
early in the morning,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:10%
when suddenly I found something
giving way in my brain,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.710 align:middle line:10%
as if a new aperture had opened.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And I felt energy rising
up from my spinal cord.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:90%
At first, I was terrified.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And my attention went to this
sensation caused by the energy.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
The moment my sensation went
towards it, the vision ceased.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Then I again concentrated.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I managed
to keep my attention

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
at the crown of my head,
while the energy rose

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
upward and upward through the
spinal cord, through the neck,

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:90%
and then into the brain.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I suddenly found
that a stream of silvery light

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:90%
was pulling into my brain.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a sound like thunder
or like a waterfall in my ears.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And the noise grew louder,
and louder, and louder.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.995 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
I began to expand.

00:28:43.995 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:10%
I cannot describe to you
exactly what I mean by this.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:10%
But it seemed that my
consciousness was now gaining

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:10%
a wider and wider space.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was leaving my body
behind and projecting myself,

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
spreading myself all
around in the universe.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> He had a bit of a difficult
time for a number of years not

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
only assimilating the
experience as to what it meant,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
but also the effect it had
on his body physically,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:84%
on his psyche
physically as well.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the course
of those years--

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was about 12
years-- he meticulously

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
observed how the energy
was moving in his body,

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and what happened to him also
in his daily life in terms

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of spontaneous
creative abilities,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:84%
like the writing of
poetry and so on.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
He came to the conclusion from
that that the experience he had

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.760 align:middle line:84%
was parallel to or the same
as the experience of some

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of the great mystics and
geniuses of the past.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And from that, he
put together the idea

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that this kundalini
energy, if you will,

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.840 align:middle line:84%
was the energy that's
driving evolution--

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
human consciousness

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:90%
to the next stage, if you will.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an
evolutionary energy,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:90%
it's working in everyone.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And so people can have
spontaneous experiences

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:84%
even if they don't have
a spiritual practice.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
If they have a
spiritual practice,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
they may have an experience
sooner rather than later.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, they
may not have it at all.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Gopi Krishna felt
that, again, there

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
was also a hereditary
component to this,

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that somehow the body,
the nervous system

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
had to be in a
certain state of--

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to say the
certain state of health.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But not maybe health
as we understand it.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It had to be ready, I guess.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you will-- he used to use
the term-- it had to be "ripe"

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:90%
for the experience.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Because there's, well, thousands
or hundreds of thousands

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:90%
of people that meditate.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:84%
They're loving,
truthful, honest people

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that don't necessarily
see that vision

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.810 align:middle line:84%
or have a taste of that
mystical state that

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
is really the glory of
the kundalini experience.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Before his death in
1984, at the age of 81,

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:10%
he wrote 17 books on
higher consciousness.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He started to write poetry
in languages he never spoke

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:90%
or read.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Creative geniuses often say
that, well, you know, I just

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:90%
saw it, it just came to me.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of
dropped in my lap.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Gopi Krishna
used to talk about it.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:84%
It was like this
information would

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:84%
pass through his
interior field of vision.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And if he didn't write it
down somehow or dictate it

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
to somebody as it was
happening, that was it.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And usually it came
so fast, that he

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get it all at once.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:10%
And so there were missing
words, or missing phrases,

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:10%
And then he'd have to
think on it on his own

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:10%
to see maybe the
pattern that was there

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.430 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it is, and make
it fit and work it out.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He also started a
social organization

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that was devoted to helping
the disadvantaged community,

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:84%
especially with regard to
issues concerning the well-being

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and rights of women.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The energy, when it moves
in you, starts to tune you up,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:84%
is maybe a good
way of putting it.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, the tuning
up can be rather rough.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
In Gopi Krishna's case,
I guess because it

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.840 align:middle line:84%
was a very strong experience,
and he had aggressively

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:90%
done this meditation--

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and I guess his
body really wasn't

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:90%
totally prepared for it--

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:84%
there was enough in
the heredity that

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.930 align:middle line:84%
enabled him to eventually
get through the experience

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
without getting into some
real serious difficulties.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Oddly enough, he felt--

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and he's written
it in many places--

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that what saved him as he
went through this experience

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and had the trials
and tribulations of it

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
was the charitable work he had
done in his life, which you can

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:90%
also call he received grace.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:84%
That was the key at
the end of the day.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The meditation, well,
of course, it helped.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it helped to
open up the channel.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But if he hadn't done that
to help other human beings,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:84%
he really felt that maybe
he wouldn't have made it.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.040 align:middle line:10%
>> His main thrust over the
years was to write about

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:10%
mystical experience and the
evolution of consciousness from

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:10%
a scientific point of view.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:10%
Traveling extensively in
Europe and North America,

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:10%
he dedicated his
life to promoting

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:10%
the scientific
study of kundalini

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.900 align:middle line:10%
and developing the
kundalini hypothesis.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> He wanted science to
investigate it for a couple

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:27.139 align:middle line:90%
of reasons.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:84%
Number one was that
the world as it is

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and the way we
are at the moment,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:84%
if it sort of gets
a stamp of approval

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:84%
that it's
scientifically approved,

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:84%
or there's been research done,
or it's been investigated,

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:90%
then there's something to it.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you know, the
experience for the individual

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:90%
is subjective.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:84%
There are some similarities
between experiences,

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:84%
some changes that may
happen to the individuals.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of these changes can
be perceived over time.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like you can
put it in a little package

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and say, there it
is, this is it,

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.980 align:middle line:90%
touch it, put your finger on it.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
You feel it, but if
somebody else hasn't

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%
had that experience, and
they don't feel it's valid,

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to share it with them.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's been,
of course, known

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:90%
as indescribable or ineffable.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted science to
investigate it for that,

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that if there
was an investigation,

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
it would also get
a lot of publicity.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Then people might also become
interested in learning about it

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.190 align:middle line:90%
even beforehand.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And then if they had a
spontaneous experience,

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:84%
it may save them, you know,
some of the difficulties.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Isaac Newton and Albert
Einstein are among the many

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:84%
eminent scientists who have had
an interest in and appreciation

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:84%
for religious and esoteric
thought and experience.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:84%
In Newton's case,
he wrote extensively

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:06.820 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of alchemy, and
in the early 1690s, apparently

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:84%
devoted more time to alchemy
than all his other pursuits.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Einstein expressed
his appreciation

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:19.390 align:middle line:84%
by proclaiming, "I maintain
that cosmic religious feeling is

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.330 align:middle line:84%
the strongest and
noblest incitement

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.020 align:middle line:90%
to scientific research."

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:84%
He further explains that "the
scientist's religious feeling

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.810 align:middle line:84%
takes the form of a
rapturous amazement

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:84%
at the harmony of
natural law, which

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
reveals an intelligence
of such superiority

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that, compared with it,
all the systematic thinking

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and acting of human beings
is an utterly insignificant

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:90%
reflection."

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:10%
>> I once asked Gopi Krishna
how long did he think we

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.905 align:middle line:10%
as a species would
inhabit the Earth.

00:36:54.905 --> 00:36:58.320 align:middle line:10%
His mind-boggling reply
was that human beings

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.560 align:middle line:10%
would continue to live on
this planet for about 4

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:10%
million years longer.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:10%
During this unimaginable
length of time,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.990 align:middle line:10%
we will, of course, colonize
other planets, he said.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:10%
But our species will dwell
on Earth for about as long

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:10%
as our Sun continues to shine,
which, by some estimates,

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:10%
is about four
million years more.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:10%
If that's the case,
I asked, why then

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:10%
are you so keen on launching
the scientific investigation

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.290 align:middle line:10%
of kundalini now?

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Because, he said, it is the
safest and most effective

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:84%
way to rid the world of
the overhanging threat

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.845 align:middle line:90%
of a nuclear war.

00:37:40.845 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:10%
To my way of
thinking, that is what

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:10%
distinguishes an illuminated
yogi from an ordinary person.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:10%
He or she becomes a spiritual
genius and a prophet

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.115 align:middle line:10%
able to see into the
future, both near and far.

00:37:57.115 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:10%
And because of the spiritual
genius or illuminated genius

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:10%
can see into the future,
such men and women

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:10%
are essential for our
survival in the atomic age.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Another part to it is, I
believe he was sure in himself

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that this investigation would
bring out some surprises

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.650 align:middle line:84%
for the scientific community
in terms of what their theories

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:84%
are about consciousness, about
the mind, about the brain,

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and about the evolution
of consciousness.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's how science has
advanced usually that there's

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.800 align:middle line:90%
a contradiction somewhere.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the theory
is they have,

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
they come to a bit
of a roadblock,

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and they can't explain that.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:90%
So he was convinced of that.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And a good example of that, in
the last 10 or 15 years anyway,

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is the concept of
neuroplasticity,

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:52.980 align:middle line:84%
where the neurons in the brain
can make different connections

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and can lead to changes
in how the brain functions

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:90%
in the individual.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.415 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, science believed,
well, the brain, that was it.

00:39:02.415 --> 00:39:05.730 align:middle line:84%
It was fixed for life,
and that's all you got.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's a good example
right there, that's current.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And there hasn't been
a scientific investigation

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:10%
into the phenomenon
of kundalini.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.620 align:middle line:10%
Nor has there been any
meaningful research

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.940 align:middle line:10%
into consciousness.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:10%
Why not?

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.450 align:middle line:10%
Because it is not possible
to understand consciousness

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:10%
without first
investigating and coming

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.700 align:middle line:10%
to know something more about
the phenomenon of kundalini.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.360 align:middle line:84%
At present, we have only Gopi
Krishna's inner explorations

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:90%
to go by.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:10%
But his observations cannot
be accepted by science until

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:10%
and unless they are
verified by experimentation.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.500 align:middle line:10%
And for this kind of research
to be taken up by science,

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:10%
Gopi Krishna's theories need to
be widely discussed and debated

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.650 align:middle line:10%
first.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.640 align:middle line:10%
For example, if a certain
practice of meditation

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.060 align:middle line:10%
were to culminate in the
production of an Einstein

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.070 align:middle line:10%
or a Plato right before the
eyes of leading scientists,

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:10%
they would readily acknowledge
the efficacy of the discipline.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And then there would be
thousands of emulators,

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.000 align:middle line:10%
all fired up with
the hope of attaining

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:10%
to the same extraordinary
state of cosmic consciousness.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:10%
Then all the
resources of science

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:10%
would be mobilized to
gain more and more insight

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:10%
into this state.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.630 align:middle line:10%
This concept would put
a different complection

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:10%
on religion also.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:10%
It would have to concede that
the whole race is evolving

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:10%
in the same direction--

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.525 align:middle line:10%
the direction followed by
the great sages and prophets

00:40:49.525 --> 00:40:51.850 align:middle line:10%
of the past--

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:55.780 align:middle line:10%
and that it has to
achieve the same goal.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.655 align:middle line:10%
It also has to be admitted then
that what we call miraculous,

00:41:00.655 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:10%
or supernatural, or
paranormal phenomena

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:10%
might be the
outcome of laws that

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:11.140 align:middle line:10%
rule the spiritual world or
the forces compounding it,

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:10%
of which we have no real
awareness at present.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> People don't realize
that just as the anatomy

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and physiology of the physical
body is the same no matter what

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:84%
your religion, the anatomy
and physiology of the soul is

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.770 align:middle line:84%
the same no matter
what your religion.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
compare, for example,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Saint Teresa of
Avila's Interior Castle

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and her Christian writings
from the 15th century

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:84%
about her kundalini
awakening, if you

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:84%
were to put that side by
side with Gopi Krishna's

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
description of his
kundalini awakening,

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:84%
they are both saying
the same thing.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's really
neat, because no matter what

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
your religion is, it
is the same thing.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:10%
>> It all came out of
the study of yogis,

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:10%
and advanced meditators, and
meditators that had abilities

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:10%
and capacities to change
how their body, their mind,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:10%
their brain worked in ways that
conventional Western medicine

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.790 align:middle line:10%
said was impossible.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And the methods and techniques
that are employed in yoga

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.320 align:middle line:84%
were originally discovered
through the actions

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:90%
of awaken kundalini.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.120 align:middle line:84%
What we think of yoga
postures in the West,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.590 align:middle line:84%
the Hatha yoga asanas,
they were first observed

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and continue to be
observed in people

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.820 align:middle line:90%
who have awakened kundalini.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.520 align:middle line:84%
They may go through some
of these postures quite

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.990 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're already studying
the Hatha yoga and other things

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.455 align:middle line:84%
related to breathwork
and mindfulness

00:42:50.455 --> 00:42:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that have very good
health benefits

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and that are very important
for all of society in terms

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.520 align:middle line:84%
of changing cardiovascular
health, decreasing stress,

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:84%
stress that exacerbates all
kinds of medical conditions.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a
very fruitful way

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:84%
of being able to pursue what
of the many kundalini-related

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.890 align:middle line:84%
techniques in science from the
ancient sages of the Eastern

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:25.090 align:middle line:84%
tradition would have
medical benefits today.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:31.150 align:middle line:10%
We're in the earliest stages
of infancy of the research.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Because research
takes money, and money

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:10%
goes after legitimate problems.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough belief or
understanding about kundalini.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot
of intermediary steps

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.580 align:middle line:90%
that are being built.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there is money
that's getting funded,

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:90%
research being funded--

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:84%
for instance,
mindfulness-based relaxation,

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.345 align:middle line:84%
kinds of stress management
exercises, meditation.

00:43:58.345 --> 00:44:00.240 align:middle line:84%
There is meditation
research being done.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
There's certain forms of yoga
starting to be researched.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The crunch in health dollars
makes it very important

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that we discover ways
to support wellness.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It's much more cost effective
to support a person's wellness

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.440 align:middle line:84%
than to try and treat
a chronic condition.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be more
effective to try and do

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:middle line:84%
research and show that
a yoga lifestyle is

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:90%
going to be healthier.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a country,
for instance, China,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that has such a huge
population, and yet, you'll

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.720 align:middle line:84%
see in every city,
people doing things

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.610 align:middle line:90%
like Tai Chi in the morning--

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.680 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds of
people, thousands of people,

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:84%
millions of people
across the country.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's been promoted.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to have that
kind of philosophy.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to have in
the West the idea

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.480 align:middle line:84%
of what do we do to
promote optimal health,

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.400 align:middle line:90%
optimal well-being.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And yoga kinds of practices
can really support that.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:11.050 align:middle line:84%
They have a tremendous
amount to give in that way.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:84%
That will be building
bridges towards then

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.560 align:middle line:84%
being able to do research
on sort of the more

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:23.060 align:middle line:84%
esoteric levels of yoga, things
related to kundalini and energy

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:90%
in that.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.450 align:middle line:10%
>> People will follow
society's rules not out of fear

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:10%
of consequences and legalism,
but out of love for mankind.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Same rules, not
one dot is removed,

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.020 align:middle line:90%
but you follow them out of love.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
as consciousness grows--

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.300 align:middle line:84%
if you were to be able to
see an individual soul,

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:90%
an individual soul is about--

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.400 align:middle line:90%
the average, some are greater--

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the average is about 15 feet
out from the physical body

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.242 align:middle line:90%
or about 30 feet in diameter.

00:45:59.242 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:90%
That's at its smallest.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:07.670 align:middle line:84%
As consciousness
raises, it expands,

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and it gets greater and greater.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these people
whose consciousness is focused

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.690 align:middle line:90%
down here, at the lower level.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Think of a V, and their
consciousness is at the bottom.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:20.090 align:middle line:84%
They view everyone else
as separate from them,

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and life is a competition.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But as your
consciousness raises up,

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.200 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize
these Vs overlap.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And you start to realize
that that other person's

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:90%
consciousness is within yours.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So you start to
develop some altruism.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you get to a higher
level of consciousness,

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.760 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
everyone exists within

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.310 align:middle line:90%
the same unified consciousness.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I cause harm to you,
I'm causing harm to myself.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would expect that
there's going to be more

00:46:55.115 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:84%
of individuals being seen as
having these kinds of symptoms

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:07.640 align:middle line:84%
looking beyond the
psychopathology that is often

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.270 align:middle line:84%
these things are characterized
as and looking for some help

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and saying, wait a minute, this
has to do with transcendent

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to have the kind
of psychology-- and we do,

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of like
transpersonal psychology--

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that says, these kinds of
states aren't pathological,

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.640 align:middle line:90%
these are enlightened states.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.820 align:middle line:84%
These are optimal states,
these are transcendent states.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.910 align:middle line:84%
People need to learn how to
integrate those so that they

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:38.180 align:middle line:90%
don't become dysfunctional.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's a sign that
that's a possibility.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And how do we develop the kinds
of treatment paradigms, places

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that help people integrate
these experiences?

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing to be
aware of, though,

00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is that in this
process right here,

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
where this person could go back
here, there is a process that,

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:84%
for a person going through it,
it's very difficult for them

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:90%
to identify it.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's what I call the
false kundalini process

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:90%
or the false born-again.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a fairly easy process,
if I were ruthless and wanted

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:27.680 align:middle line:84%
to control people, to
lead them through it.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.530 align:middle line:84%
What it is, it's a
mind control technique.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It's done quite often in
charismatic churches, where

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.620 align:middle line:84%
you step one, allow the
volume of your voice

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.330 align:middle line:84%
to go up and down; step two,
tell a sad story, happy story,

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.940 align:middle line:84%
knock a person's emotional
consciousness off balance;

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:52.250 align:middle line:84%
step three, induce guilt,
fear, anger; step 4,

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.500 align:middle line:84%
offer them a way
to get rid of that.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They will swear on a
Bible they are born-again.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It has absolutely nothing
to do with religion.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.420 align:middle line:90%
It is a mind control game.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a stage
hypnosis induction technique.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This also applies to
the kundalini process.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:90%
It's totally false.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And where it is
so dangerous is--

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.400 align:middle line:84%
the pitfall is that
instead of you surrendering

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to the divine, which is what
takes a person up this slope,

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
this person surrenders their
authority to another human

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.980 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.400 align:middle line:84%
This is true on an individual
basis on the spiritual path.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also true on a
greater basis in society.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Germans, the Prussians

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.890 align:middle line:84%
were very proud people prior to
World War I. They were up here.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But they lost the war
that put them down here.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.940 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, there was
the flu epidemic of 1918.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.430 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
there was famine.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So the people were
in a terrible place.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:04.060 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Abraham
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.730 align:middle line:84%
it was the base layer
that they were looking

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.220 align:middle line:90%
for-- food, shelter, security.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Security-- things
that give comfort.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up happening,
they looked for someone

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.370 align:middle line:90%
to surrender their authority to.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And that set the stage
for the leader that

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:90%
led them into World War II.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Or 2000 years ago, the Jews
were a very proud society.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But they were defeated
by the Romans.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:90%
They were down here.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
for a King, someone

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.660 align:middle line:90%
to surrender their authority to.

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.807 align:middle line:90%
And along came this guy.

00:50:35.807 --> 00:50:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to
make him their King.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, no,
no, but I will teach you

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.550 align:middle line:90%
how to get from here to here.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Right there is what the
New Testament is about.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.920 align:middle line:84%
If I must brag, let
me brag of my faults.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.400 align:middle line:84%
The humbled, the meek
shall inherit the Kingdom.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
diminish the self.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dark night of the
soul, which is right in here.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And what is the most
important commandment?

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Love, which is what
brings you up here.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The true language
of love is silence.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Family, friends, employers,
country, state, and city--

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:19.680 align:middle line:84%
all of your life can be
continued and expressed

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.580 align:middle line:84%
within the parameters of
walking a higher path.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Much of this path will be unique
to you and your circumstances

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You will be given what
you need to flourish.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to surrender
to the surprising gifts

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and experiences that will
typically come your way.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You'll need to source yourself
and make your own decision.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, what we all have
to do is understand and realize

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that the mystics that came in
the past and the advice they

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
gave, which is passed
down, basically,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.700 align:middle line:84%
in the religious scriptures
about the mode of life that we

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.480 align:middle line:90%
lead, is key.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.810 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously diet, general
physical health, and so on.

00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:13.020 align:middle line:10%
But the mental
health of the person,

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.730 align:middle line:10%
in the sense of
how we think, how

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:20.400 align:middle line:10%
we behave to develop compassion,
understanding, and love,

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.940 align:middle line:10%
is the key for a healthy process
and a healthy human race.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone should stop
and ask themselves,

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.050 align:middle line:90%
why am I doing what I'm doing?

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.400 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.540 align:middle line:10%
What's the meaning of
what I'm chasing in life?

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Whether it be my
identity as a parent

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.250 align:middle line:10%
with a dozen of
children, whether it

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:10%
be a pile of wealth
or pension funds,

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:10%
what is the purpose
of what I am doing?

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And what is my purpose
for being here?

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.140 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Because by asking
the right questions,

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:01.810 align:middle line:90%
the answers will come to you.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Every one of us has
to build a better person.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how the world is going
to, in my mind, survive.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't legislate it,
you can't do it by force.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It has to bloom.

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And it will bloom.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is also considered to
be the guardian of evolution.

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So a higher consciousness
or cosmic consciousness

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:27.240 align:middle line:84%
isn't just an experience
for a short period of time.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.370 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
day, we're supposedly

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:36.160 align:middle line:84%
going to live in it like we live
now, except with that glory,

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and that love, and that
awe, and the perception

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that generally we don't
have at the moment

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I worked as an estate planner
for years with very wealthy

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.480 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.938 align:middle line:84%
And the first
question I asked them

00:53:47.938 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:84%
was, how much are you worth
three minutes after you're

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.370 align:middle line:90%
dead?

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:57.020 align:middle line:84%
What good is your wealth
is what I'm saying.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a tool.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It is not your mission.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So the intellect is there
to help us develop a lifestyle

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.650 align:middle line:84%
where we can take advantage
of it and develop ourselves

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:13.640 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
in general is we're not

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:19.410 align:middle line:90%
spending that time that way.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.860 align:middle line:84%
We're either working
harder to make more money,

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.180 align:middle line:84%
or we're kind of just goofing
around doing something.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.830 align:middle line:90%
We should have fun.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:28.955 align:middle line:90%
Life is supposed to be fun.

00:54:28.955 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be joyful.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.210 align:middle line:90%
But we have to have a balance.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:36.260 align:middle line:10%
>> If people will pursue
their highest nature,

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.700 align:middle line:10%
that is the way to pursue
the unfolding of kundalini.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.870 align:middle line:10%
Pursue your highest
nature as a loving,

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:47.340 align:middle line:10%
compassionate generous,
kind human being.

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Pursue your ability
to serve others

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.690 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of attitude.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And you will be fully pursuing
the Holy Spirit, the kundalini,

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:90%
however you want to call it.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And it will become alive
and present in you.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You have mysticism on one
side, if you will, or religion.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And you have empirical
science on the other.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And they meet a little bit.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's things that one
can do for the other and vice

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And that I think we need to
focus on a little bit more

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.190 align:middle line:90%
in this time.

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Technology can give us
the time to meditate.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.040 align:middle line:10%
You know, we don't have to
be afraid of being attacked

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.730 align:middle line:10%
by wild animals all the time.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We have conveniences,
so that we're not

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.030 align:middle line:84%
spending all day long
doing hard physical labor

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.710 align:middle line:90%
and then exhausted at the end.

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that
Gopi Krishna pointed out.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:46.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've been
provided with those advances.

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> People need to find
their own answers though.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Not "here's my answer, this
fits universally for everyone."

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It has to be their purpose,
not what I tell them

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.710 align:middle line:90%
their purpose should be.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, everyone will
find the same purpose.

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's many steps
to get to that place.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not going to pass
enough laws to make people do

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.620 align:middle line:84%
something that they
don't want to do.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is the other reason
why Gopi Krishna wanted science

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.190 align:middle line:90%
to investigate it.

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he was
confident that they

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:32.205 align:middle line:84%
would validate the process in
some way, or they would find--

00:56:32.205 --> 00:56:33.580 align:middle line:84%
something would
be different that

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.060 align:middle line:90%
would change people's ideas.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And that once that
happened, people

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:45.070 align:middle line:84%
would realize that having this
experience even for 10 seconds

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:47.790 align:middle line:84%
is more than all the
money in the world.

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It means nothing.

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's why historically,
well, Buddha was a King, right?

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:59.560 align:middle line:84%
He just threw it, gave it
away, left it, didn't need it.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.770 align:middle line:84%
There are stories in the
newspaper now of millionaires,

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:06.550 align:middle line:84%
multimillionaires just
donating their money away

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.620 align:middle line:90%
because their life is empty.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It's empty because this
component is missing from it.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:20.097 align:middle line:84%
And so I would wish everyone
that there would be stadiums

00:57:20.097 --> 00:57:22.180 align:middle line:84%
where-- you know how people
go to a sporting event

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.460 align:middle line:90%
now to watch?

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, instead of watching
a sporting event,

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:29.230 align:middle line:84%
you'd be able to see
somebody have this experience

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:30.685 align:middle line:90%
and have the joy from it.

00:57:30.685 --> 00:57:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And that joy, to a
certain degree, of course,

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.360 align:middle line:90%
would spread.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And then people would realize,
well, gee, maybe I can do it.

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:40.690 align:middle line:84%
The downside is,
there's no shortcuts,

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.130 align:middle line:90%
and there's no guarantee.

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's
certainly worth, to me.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make the world
a better place irregardless.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We are co-creating our life
with an energy that is so much

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.210 align:middle line:90%
wiser than we are.

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:57.290 align:middle line:90%
We've let go of control.

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.650 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
control our life anymore.

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.810 align:middle line:84%
This energy is
moving through life.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel
like my journey

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.780 align:middle line:84%
has been a constant learning
how to let go and let

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.660 align:middle line:84%
this energy guide me
to become who I am now.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.760 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that I
was capable of writing.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I never knew I was a writer.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I started writing
about all this.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting published
in nursing journals

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and respiratory therapy journals
while I was still a student.

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I wound up going to Connecticut
and learning all about

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.530 align:middle line:90%
psychiatric research.

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.800 align:middle line:10%
And I was able to interview
near-death experiences

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.400 align:middle line:10%
for six years about kundalini.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's been my life.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And then I met my now husband.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.440 align:middle line:90%
So everything unfolded.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I was terrified when
I left, I really was.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.180 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I had to do it.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I had to save my soul.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We have a wonderful
relationship now.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have a wonderful
relationship with my kids.

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:51.580 align:middle line:90%
And I have a wonderful husband.

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there were
some scary years there.

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But boy, is it
all been worth it.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.040 align:middle line:90%
I'd do it all over again.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I found a way to open up
to this energy and develop it

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.940 align:middle line:90%
in a safe way.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:11.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been from dawn to midnight
of constant spiritual work.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.745 align:middle line:90%
It's energy work.

00:59:12.745 --> 00:59:27.100 align:middle line:90%


00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, and maybe
this is my ego talking,

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but enlightenment is the
goal of this Earth plane.

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.886 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I want to be.

00:59:34.886 --> 00:59:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I may not get here
this lifetime.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I
can get is my goal.

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So if she comes
knocking, open the door.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:50.710 align:middle line:90%


00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Divinity has no limitations
inside of the material

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.220 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It's abundance is
without measure.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And it is into this abundance
of love, joy, opportunity,

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and creation that
we travel as it

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
is opened to us when
we take our first steps

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:15.730 align:middle line:90%
off the threshold of light.

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini forms the bridge
that one walks to and from

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
in living a life that is
exalted and earthbound

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:27.370 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
It is very important to come
into our divine expression

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance of kundalini from
the aspect of our core self--

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
yes, the actual
you that you are,

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.510 align:middle line:90%
the essence of your personhood.

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:46.780 align:middle line:84%
This would include the
validation of the you

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that you are, the
sex, the looks, all

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of the descriptors of you.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And from this honest
understanding,

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
we take into account
the brutalities of life

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.030 align:middle line:90%
that have been experienced.

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We accept and
realize the lessons

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
of these incursions
and sculptings

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.490 align:middle line:90%
into and of our soul.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And we move into
the understanding

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.551 align:middle line:90%
that we are still who we are.

01:01:14.551 --> 01:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
We are still that divine
truth made manifest

What have you adopted
and internalized

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:27.550 align:middle line:90%
as part of a coping strategy?
