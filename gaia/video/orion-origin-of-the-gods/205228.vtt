00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest question on
everyone's mind for thousands

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
of years, where did
the gods come from?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It seems that for
years we've been

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:90%
looking in the wrong place.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
the oldest cultures,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
they describe how a
long, long time ago, they

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
lived alongside a
civilization of gods.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were said to
be incredible navigators

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and astronomers and
magicians, real people

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:90%
rather than imaginary beings.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And direct contact with them
was a regular part of life.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They often describe them as
human-like but not quite human.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And although these unusual
people lived on Earth,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
their point of origin,
their homeland,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
was said to be elsewhere, a
very specific place in the sky.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And whether you live in
the northern or southern

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
hemisphere, there's one
enigmatic constellation

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that dominates the
sky, and that is Orion.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
They even go so far
as to claim that Orion

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
was the origin of
civilization itself.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's what I call
a radical departure

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
from the history
we've been taught.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But the big question is,
what led our predecessors

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:90%
to reach this conclusion?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The Bolivian
altiplano, it's filled

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
with oddities and
that one of them

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
is the unsettling
question of Aymara,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
a language that some
experts consider

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:90%
to be the oldest in the world.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:10%
And the computer scientist
by the name of Iván Guzmán de

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:10%
Rojas demonstrated how Aymara
is both skillfully designed

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:10%
and artificial,
particularly its syntax,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:10%
which after careful analysis,
was found to be rigidly

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:10%
structured and ambiguous.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:10%
And unlike standard language,
which evolves organically

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:10%
over many thousands
of years, Aymara

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:10%
appears to have been created.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:10%
And Rojas proved how this
ancient Andean tongue

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:10%
can be written concisely in
the type of algebraic shorthand

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:10%
that a computer can understand.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
Aymara is an algorithm

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
with the ability to translate
from one language to another.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of bridge
language, whereby

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the language of an
original document

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
can be translated
into Aymara and then

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:90%
into any number of languages.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But who on Earth had
the intellectual ability

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
to design a complete language
from scratch thousands of years

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
ago and in one of the most
remote regions of the world?

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
To answer this, we need
to look at the Aymara

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:90%
people themselves.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And they are one of
the oldest on Earth.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And even so, they
are the progeny

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of an even older culture, the
Bukidnon, whose tribespeople

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
still speak about their
homeland in the Pacific Ocean,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
an island called Lapukije, which
sank following a global flood.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And linking these two tribes
are another ancient people

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Andes, the
Uru of Lake Titicaca.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Now the Uru are descendants
of the earliest inhabitants

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Andes.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And fewer than 5,000
people exist today.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you asked them
where they come from,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%
they point to the sky.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:90%
From Orion.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
It's quite possible that
this tribal memory derives

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
from a group of
traveling gods called

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
the Urukehu, who used to sail
between New Zealand, Easter

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Island, and the massive
islands on the way

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.492 align:middle line:84%
to South America
called Kainga Nui Nui.

00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:19.325 align:middle line:84%
And it has since vanished
beneath the waves.

00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
No written information survives
about the Urukehu, however,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
their existence and
exploits are immortalized

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in the oral tradition of
another ancient people,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.975 align:middle line:90%
the Waitaha of New Zealand.

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha established
a physical contact

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:84%
with the Urukehu
back in the days

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
when the tribe lived on Easter
Island, which they describe not

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
as a single island as it is
today but as a group of islands

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:90%
and lands.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And this alone gives
us a marker in time,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
because it accurately depicts
the geology of the region

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
before the catastrophic rise
in sea level 11,000 years ago.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:10%
A fruitful relationship
was established

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:10%
between Waitaha and Urukehu
because the knowledge that

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:10%
was imparted let the Waitaha
establish its own Three

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:10%
Houses of Wisdom,
each of which was

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:10%
named for a star in
the Belt of Orion.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And they remain so
to this very day.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the elder
grandmothers of the Waitaha

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
actually describe
that relationship,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "the
School of the Canoe

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is the name given by
our ancient ancestors

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
to Net of the World, Orion.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The name is also given to
the founders of Waitaha.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Many of our families
and groups descend

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
from these original elder
voyaging ancestors."

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:10%
These three founding groups are
the ancient people of Waitaha.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It is these families who gave
the sacred social pattern

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
to join and become as one
nation that would live happily

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
in peace and plenty in the
lands and outer islands

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:90%
of Easter Island.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And each of the three
Waitaha family groups

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
then took on the name of a
star in the Belt of Orion.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:84%
There is Kurawaka, which
is the star Mintaka.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was composed
of leaders, thinkers,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:90%
and planners.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Then there was Rakaiwaka,
which is the star Alnilam.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
investigators and researchers

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and contractors.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Pukauwaka,
which is the star Alnitak.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They were the knowledge keepers
and dreamers of the nation.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Contact with the
Urukehu took the form

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of regular visitations,
which considerably expanded

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge base of
the tribe concerning

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
the mechanics of nature
and the universe,

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
not to mention social
and moral codes

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and other valuable information
for the establishment

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of a healthy coexistence
between people and planet.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And to quote the Waitaha again,
"in all the ancient teachings,

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
our teachers and healers
had direct communication

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
with our ancient learned
ancestors, who came to us

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
in the old world
villages and helped

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:84%
in the development of our
cultural and traditional

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:90%
knowledge."

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But as time went on,
the Urukehu ceased

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to appear in physical
form, preferring instead

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to communicate through the
wisdom keeper of the tribe.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And to quote the
Waitaha once more,

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:84%
"the elder seers of Waitaha
say they remained in contact

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
with the Urukehu
within the spirit

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
houses of the stars of Orion's
Belt, which they considered

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to be both doorways to the
spirit world and access points

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to the Waitaha's
extended family.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So in a manner of
speaking, Orion

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
was considered a place that was
accessed physically as well as

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
After visiting Easter
Island, the Urukehu

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:90%
would sail to New Zealand.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Their domain was
[NON-ENGLISH],, the sacred nest.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a landscape
temple comprised

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of three sites made of limestone
monoliths, a number of which

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
were once shaped by human hands.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And two of them
function as markers

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of celestial objects
and thus provide likely

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
dates when the Urukehu were
present in these highlands.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And one monolith is
specifically referred to

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:90%
as the calendar stone.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And it marks the first
ascension of Orion's Belt

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
above the distant mountain range
on the spring equinox in BC.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
One would need to wait
another 2,000 years

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
before the entire constellation
appeared for the first time

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:90%
in 10,400 BC.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the same moment,
across the valley,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
the main monument
marks the rising

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Urukehu's other prominent
constellation, the Southern

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Cross.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:10%
Oddly enough, the same
two constellations

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:10%
were of equal importance to the
gods and people of the Andes,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:10%
where they are called the
Great Cross and Small Cross

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:10%
and accepted as twin
gateways between worlds.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
To the North of New Zealand
lies the island of Tonga.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:84%
The name in early Polynesian
means something highly prized.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And long ago on
this island, Orion

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:84%
was marked with large earthen
mounds across a wide area.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are long since
eroded, but to the east stands

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
one oversized
megalithic structure

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:90%
called Ha'amonga a Maui.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And it resembles
half an H. It is

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:10%
said to reference the rising of
Orion's Belt, which islanders

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:10%
called Tolowa, a
celestial gateway

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:10%
into the world of the gods.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, if so, then this megalith
forms the terrestrial portion

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of that portal.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
The monument itself
is dedicated to Maui,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
a God who sailed the Pacific and
rebooted civilization on land

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that became islands
after sea levels

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
rose dramatically
following the flood.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And Maui was also a
grandson of the Urukehu,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
who as we have already
know were intimately

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:90%
associated with Orion.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, further to the
north, Orion makes its mark

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:90%
in the traditions of Japan.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
An ever-present feature
of the Japanese landscape

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:90%
is the Torii Arch.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:84%
It defines the passage
from this world

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
into the sacred
abode of the gods.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And it has been suggested
that the shape represents

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the lower portion of Orion,
with the crossbar as the belt.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And the doorway
itself marks the area

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:84%
occupied in the
constellation itself

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
by the M42 nebula, which many
ancient cultures describe

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.565 align:middle line:90%
as the source of creation.

00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:10%
This focus on Orion as a
point of origin and fertility

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:10%
led to an association
between the constellation

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:10%
and agriculture,
specifically the cultivation

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:10%
of that staple
ingredients, rice.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And planting commenced on the
spring equinox with a ritual

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
purification during
the setting of Orion,

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and it concluded with the
harvest upon its rising

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:90%
on the autumn equinox.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, this ritual,
with its intention

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of creating harmony and an
ideal sustainable world,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:84%
was governed by
protective deities who

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
were honored the moment Orion's
Belt reached its highest

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
point in the sky.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
At this very
moment, the ancestor

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
gods, having offered their
knowledge of crop domestication

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:84%
to humanity return
to their world.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the ritual
commemorated a relationship

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
between divine knowledge and
its practical application

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, whereby
its inhabitants

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.555 align:middle line:90%
could lead a balanced life.

00:14:38.555 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, the three
belt stars are

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
defined in three principal
prehistoric gods,

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:90%
the Sumiyoshi.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:10%
And the position
of their temples

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:10%
across southwestern
Japan are highly

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:10%
suggestive of the
alignment of the stars.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:84%
These gods are also
singularly associated

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
with the ocean and seafaring,
much like the Urukehu gods.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And like the Waitaha
of New Zealand,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese
practitioners of Shinto

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
also equate the three
belt stars with the three

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:84%
great original teachers
of this ancient religion.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Orion is an icon of
cultural values, which

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:84%
are themselves rooted in the
teachings of the founding gods

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:90%
of Japan over 10,000 years ago.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And to cement this relationship,
the Japanese design

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
the tsuzumi, a double-ended
hand drum whose design

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
mirrors the shape of
Orion, with the cord used

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to bind the strings in the
middle marking its belt.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
They're still used to open
and close religious ceremonies

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:90%
to this very day.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.701 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.701 --> 00:16:09.166 align:middle line:90%
[BELL RINGING]

00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
The pursuits of the Urukehu and
their association with Orion,

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
even their physical
characteristics

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:84%
as tall, light-skinned,
red-haired gods,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
matches another group of
unusually advanced people

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
who arrived in Egypt shortly
after the partial destruction

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of their island's
domain 12,000 years ago.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And in this part of the
world, they went by the title

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
Aku Shemsu Hor, which means
shining ones, followers

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:90%
of Horus.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, there
is another curious overlap

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
between these two
distant people.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The Urukehu refer to
Orion as the sacred nest.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the Waitaha tradition,
this was bestowed as a title

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to the female flood
hero, Hotu Matu'a.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:10%
And she was given the
title Net of the World

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:10%
for her ability to map
the rearranged lands

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:10%
throughout the Pacific,
most of which of course, had

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:10%
been transformed into islands.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:10%
And yet, the same
story is applied

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:10%
to the followers of
Horus, who are depicted

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:10%
on the walls of
the Temple of Edfu

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:10%
and whose exploits are
recorded in the building texts.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The followers of Horus too
were remapping the seas

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And in one panel, we
see a group of gods

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:84%
called the Crew of the
Falcon on a boat that

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:90%
uses a net for a sail.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same symbol.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
resemblances between these two

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:90%
groups of gods.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
may have all belonged

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
to the same fraternity.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the best-known
gods of Egypt, of course,

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is Osiris, one of
the original gods who

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
lived in the prehistoric age
and quite likely not in Egypt

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
at all, but a far-away
island which is referred

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:90%
to by three interlinked names.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
One is Taneta, the
Land of the Gods.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Then there's [NON-ENGLISH],,
The Island of Ancestors

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and possibly a reference to Lake
Titicaca and its island temple

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:90%
of Tiwanaku.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a third
called the Island of Fire.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, Osiris was an initiate who
possessed the ability to travel

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%
to the other world and back.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:10%
And in one of the
traditions, he takes

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:10%
to his astral boat and
journeys along the Milky Way,

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:10%
disembarking at a gate called
Sahu, the Egyptian word

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.355 align:middle line:10%
for Orion.

00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Osiris specifically
aims for Orion's Belt.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, the godman
acquires Sahu as a nickname

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and then takes on the
shape of the constellation

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
as it appears to the eye,
as a man with his leg long

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.375 align:middle line:90%
and his stride extended.

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:10%
The oldest Egyptian
traditions are very specific

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:10%
about the physical link
having once existed

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:10%
between our world and Orion,
with the belt stars serving

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:10%
a kind of portal into
the domain of the gods.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And the connection
between the two

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
fostered the advent
of gods on Earth

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and eventually led to the
development of human culture.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And the texts even describe
how on occasion the gods

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:84%
would allow a human
to visit their abode.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And this lucky individual gained
access to specialized knowledge

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and returned enlightened,
with raised intellectual

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual capacity
that placed them on par

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:90%
with the gods themselves.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bad reason
to go astral traveling

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.589 align:middle line:90%
for a day or two, isn't it?

00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The vessel that took
you to this domain

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%
wasn't always a solar boat.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid texts describe
the ascent of the individual

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:10%
into the abode of gods by
way of a metal throne made

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:10%
of a substance called bjA.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Now frustratingly,
no description

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
survives to tell us the
nature of this unusual metal.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Only a description
of its function

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
remains, which describes
this throne as,

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.965 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "a ladder for
you to ascend to the sky."

00:21:12.965 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Most temples in Egypt
stand upon the foundations

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
of earlier structures
that date back

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to the time of the arrival
of the followers of Horus.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And not surprisingly
they too reference

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Orion in the era when they
were originally built.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So the entrance to the
Temple of Edfu, for example,

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
matches Orion at its
mid-heaven position

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
on the winter
solstice of 10,500 BC.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Another is a small chapel
just beyond the complex

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
of Medinet Habu and dedicated
to the creator god Amun.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And few people pay much
attention to this building

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
because it is visually
inferior to the grandiose site

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:90%
next door.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But it is of supreme importance,
because beneath its foundation

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
lies one of the original
mounds said to be the burial

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:90%
site of eight primordial gods.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And an important clue
to its remote age

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
lies in its difference
of alignment

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
with the adjacent sites, because
this temple is referencing

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:90%
a very different horizon.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, it does match the
rising of Orion on the winter

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:90%
solstice in 8,000 BC.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Just like in Tonga,
the followers of Horus

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
also built a mirror
image of Orion in Egypt.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The Giza Plateau represents
the terrestrial dwelling place

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:90%
of Osiris.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So not surprisingly,
the three main pyramids

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
form an umbilical link
with Orion's Belt.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And they mirror its
appearance in the night

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:84%
sky across the Nile on the
spring equinox of 10,400 BC.

Coincidentally, the same date
memorialized by the Urukehu

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in their landscape

The god that traverses the

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
is depicted in India

It's the Festival

And it takes place around the
winter solstice, whereupon

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
this chariot is seen moving
across the sky in the form

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, who's depicted
in physical form

as the cosmic dancer
Shiva Nataraja Murti.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:84%

as antediluvian gods

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%

between these two cultures.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
The gods, who brought the
civilizing arts to humanity

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:84%
always appeared in
groups of seven sages,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
led by an eighth, a
charismatic leader.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And in India, they
were the seven Rishi.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:10%
They were sages, masters
of specialized knowledge

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:10%
from medicine, letters,
architecture, and astronomy,

and so forth.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And central to their
story is Orion, the master

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
of created things, suggesting
the constellation is

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:84%
the very source of
life and knowledge.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And the same concept
is common to the gods

One Indian sage was
called Vishvamitra,

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and one of his greatest
exploits was transferring

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
a king in physical
form to the sky

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%

Orion."

That's not a far cry from
the journey undertaken

Such stories, dating back
to prehistoric times,

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
appear throughout the
Indian subcontinent.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:10%

And for those who
followed the advice

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and elevated
themselves spiritually,

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
the gods would offer
them access to Orion

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:90%
while they were still alive.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, this implies
a physical connection

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.455 align:middle line:90%
existed between our two worlds.

00:27:15.455 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Sacred text such as the
Puranas and the Mahabharata

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
suggest this when they
make startling claims

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that the gods assumed human form
when a situation demanded it,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
such as a global
cataclysm or the necessity

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
for mass social reform
due to the degeneracy

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.980 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:10%
So it would be an
aberration were it

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.640 align:middle line:10%
not for the fact that Aboriginal
tribes of Northern Australia

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:10%
agree with this statement.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And their oral traditions
identify a group of helpful

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:84%
gods called the [NON-ENGLISH],,
which means watchers,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
who are said to have appeared
from the direction of Orion

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:90%
prior to the Great Flood.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:10%
And these watchers were capable
of taking on physical form

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:10%
when a situation demanded it.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And they possessed
physical characteristics

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:90%
similar to humans.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And according to another
Aboriginal tribe, the Wurrong,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
such celestial
beings were lawgivers

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.990 align:middle line:84%
whose physical
representations are

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
seen in the constellations
and stars of Pleiades, Taurus,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:90%
and of course, Orion.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, we saw how in Tonga,
Orion is called Tolowa.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The name migrated
to Central America,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:84%
where this homeland of
the gods is called Tollan.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And in both cases, it means the
same thing, the place of reeds.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's funny how
this idea of being

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
able to access Orion via
a reed is a concept also

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
common to India, to Persia,
to Egypt, even the traditions

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Hopi.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.720 align:middle line:10%
The foundation of Maya
cosmology is established

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:10%
on a triangle of stars
that makes up Orion,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:10%
and that is Saiph, Alnitak, and
the great blue giant, Rigel.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And directly in the center
of this equilateral triangle

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:10%
is nebula M42.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya called it,
K'ak', the flame of creation.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.595 align:middle line:84%
And they refer to it as
the heart of the sky.

00:30:01.595 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:84%

the Egyptian word for shining,

Aku Shemsu Hora,

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:90%
the name of the Egyptian gods.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:84%
The Maya look upon
Orion as a first father.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:84%
They call it Hun Hunahpu, a
progenitor of their culture.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, Orion is seen
as the hearth of the universe.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And they memorialize the
importance of this relationship

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
by placing three stones at
the center of their temples.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And the understanding is
so integral to Maya belief

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that even traditional
houses feature

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.485 align:middle line:90%
a hearth made of three stones.

00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Just as in Egypt, the arrival
of the gods in Central America

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:84%
presages the establishment
of civilization

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and the moral codes
that came with it.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And the event was commemorated
by the building of Teotihuacán.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Three enormous pyramids form
the hearth of this temple city,

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and together they mirror
the belt stars of Orion.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the entire
complex is connected

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:84%
by a reed, a long avenue
called the Path of the Soul.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And just like the association
between Giza and Osiris,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Teotihuacán is said to
be the principal domain

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:90%
of Quetzalcoatl.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And together with his
group of seven sages,

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:84%
they came to be known
as the Red Ant People

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:84%
for practical as well
as symbolic reasons.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Like other gods
encountered so far,

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:84%
they were described
as red or fair haired.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But the more apparent
connection to red ants

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
is because they labored to
create order out of the chaos

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that they found after the flood,
qualities similarly observed

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:90%
in industrious red ants.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And for the symbolic
association,

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
the tripartite body of the
ants represents the three stars

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:29.924 align:middle line:90%
of Orion's Belt.

00:32:29.924 --> 00:32:32.888 align:middle line:90%
[ETHEREAL MUSIC]

00:32:32.888 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Given how many
cultures view Orion

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
as the origin of the gods or a
gateway into their knowledge,

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.880 align:middle line:84%
it is beyond reasonable doubt
that these stories are not

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:84%
symbolic gestures but
culturally shared experiences.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But where do these
associations begin?

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The answer lies in the origin
of the name Orion itself.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Orion actually derives from
a later Greek word, oarion,

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and it means boundary.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests that the
constellation marks some kind

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:90%
of frontier into another realm.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Greeks
transliterated oarion

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
from the name of a
great pre-flood sage

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:90%
by the name Ouranos.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:10%
It is quite possibly the oldest
surviving linguistic root.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
As for Ouranos, the sage, his
name means red man of Anu,

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and he held the title
Light of Heaven.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So Ouranos himself
belonged to one

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest and best-known
groups of gods, the Anunnaki

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to this story.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
The offspring of the
Anunnaki are this tribe--

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:84%
there's an old Hebrew, as
nemela, meaning ant or ant

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And as for the
craftsmen who worked

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:84%
alongside the
Anunnaki, the Watchers,

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:84%
they are described
as shining ones

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:84%
on account of two
observations, one, from the oil

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
that they rub on their
skin, which gave it

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
a shining appearance,
and because they were

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
highly educated people,
they were also illuminated,

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.820 align:middle line:90%
figuratively speaking.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the offspring
of the Watchers

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.524 align:middle line:84%
were called nephila, which
means children or Orion.

00:34:30.524 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.929 align:middle line:84%
These identical connections
are found on the opposite side

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:42.150 align:middle line:90%
of the world in Arizona.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Like the Waitaha of
New Zealand, the Hopi

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:90%
view Orion as a house of wisdom.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:10%
And every November during
the Hawk, or initiates moon,

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:10%
members of the Hopi
Kiva, conduct a ceremony

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:10%
marking the beginning
of the ceremonial year,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:10%
during which an elder
conveys the emergence legend.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.400 align:middle line:10%
And during the time
of the Great Flood,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:10%
an emissary kachina
by the name Massau

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:10%
assisted the ancestors
of the Hopi navigate

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:10%
from a sunken homeland
in the Pacific

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:10%
and towards what
is today Arizona.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And the ceremony begins the
moment that the Belt of Orion

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.800 align:middle line:90%
appears above the Kiva.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The central location where
this teaching takes place

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:84%
is in the village of Walpi,
one of the three Hopi mesas

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that bear a strong resemblance
to the belt stars of Orion.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, Walpi actually
means the place

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of the watchers, whom
the Hopi look upon

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:90%
as the original protectors.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
The ancestors of the Hopi
were the Hisatsinom, later

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:90%
known as Anasazi.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was they who originally
adopted Orion as a talisman

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.680 align:middle line:84%
to remind the people of the
origin of the kachina in charge

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of their safety, a godman
by the name of Anu Sinom.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So he was known as a
looker, a watcher, leader

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:90%
of the ant people.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:84%
In tribal tradition,
this unusual humanoid

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.990 align:middle line:84%
is described as
generous and hard

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.020 align:middle line:84%
working, willing to
provide food to the people

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and teach the methods
of food preparation

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:84%
so they could ride out the
prolonged upheaval taking place

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:84%
outside their protective cave
during the great catastrophe

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that befell the Earth.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And here is where we find
a link to the Middle East,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.650 align:middle line:84%
because the Hopi
word for ant, anu,

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
forms part of the
phrase anu naki,

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and it literally
means and father whom.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So Anu Sinom, this
ant person, is

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
associated with
the point of origin

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Hopi and their ancestors.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's another kachina
involved in this Hopi legend

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.250 align:middle line:90%
and that is Sohu.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
He's a godman who
acted as intermediary

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.350 align:middle line:90%
between Orion and Earth.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:10%
And he is depicted with
three stars above his head,

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:10%
each representing
the Belt of Orion.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The odd thing is,
Sohu is practically

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:84%
identical to the Egyptian
word for Orion, sahu,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:84%
when in ancient China
it is shen, which

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese depicted as an
ideogram in the form of a head

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.115 align:middle line:90%
topped with three stars.

00:37:58.115 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:90%
There is yet another overlap.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.680 align:middle line:84%
This time, it's the
tradition of the Maya.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.400 align:middle line:84%
As we saw earlier, the point
of origin in Maya cosmology

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.630 align:middle line:84%
is the M42 nebula that resides
in Orion, to which they

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:90%
refer to as heart of the sky.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Now oddly enough, it is
the title given by the Hopi

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:90%
to their creator god, Sotuknang.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:36.630 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Far from being allegorical
tales or metaphors,

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:84%
these accounts from
around the world

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:84%
indicate how a
physical link once

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
existed between the
terrestrial world and Orion,

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.110 align:middle line:84%
with the belt stars
serving as a kind of portal

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.660 align:middle line:90%
into the domain of the gods.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if lucky humans were
allowed to visit this abode

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and return to tell the
tale, obviously there

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:05.010 align:middle line:84%
must have been an observable
and physical connection

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.680 align:middle line:90%
between these two worlds.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Is this connection is
still in existence?

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:10%
There are several
existing tribal accounts

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:10%
around the world that tell
of the energy associated

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:10%
with Orion having been abused
and misused a long time ago,

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:10%
among gods and humans
alike, by the way.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And this led to the
good gods to shut down

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.960 align:middle line:84%
many of the temples associated
with this constellation.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And it may explain why no one
during the time of Pharaohs

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Khafre and Khufu, to whom the
Giza pyramids are attributed

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:84%
by academia, knew where the
entrance to the Great Pyramid

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:90%
was located.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was four and
1/2 thousand years ago.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.450 align:middle line:90%


00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So there is a hint
to what happened,

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and it is found
in the flood lift

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.910 align:middle line:90%
from the region of Vietnam.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it goes
something like this--

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:84%
back in the days when celestial
beings and humans could travel

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:84%
back and forth to
visit one another,

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:84%
when people lived for
hundreds of years,

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and the region was
named in [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
there lived three lords, earthly
representatives of a celestial

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.610 align:middle line:90%
being named Thun.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And all that Thun
required was for people

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.855 align:middle line:84%
to honor him at meal times
and follow the rules set down

00:40:35.855 --> 00:40:36.655 align:middle line:90%
for good conduct.

00:40:36.655 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But gradually, the free lords
neglected this simple courtesy.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They fell out of favor
with the heavens.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And a great flood wiped out
everyone and everything,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
except the free lords,
who built a raft

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and took aboard their
wives and children.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And they met Thun in the
sky and reassured him

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:10%
that they had learned
from their error,

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:10%
and from now on, they
would be more respectful.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So Thun agreed and
sent down a messenger

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to teach people all the
craft necessary upon which

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.725 align:middle line:90%
to rebuild a civil society.

00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But soon, the Earth
became overpopulated

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and the three lords took
to regular intoxication.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So this time, Thun
recalled the lords

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and replaced them with
his messenger, Kun Balun,

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and seven sages.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And when he was convinced
that the people could

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
look after themselves
once again, he

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
had the Bridge to Heaven
collapsed so that humans

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:90%
could no longer visit.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, the point is this--

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.220 align:middle line:84%
long ago, humans
established a relationship

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:84%
with the gods who, on
occasion, allowed an individual

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.250 align:middle line:84%
into their world so
that this person could

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:84%
share a favorable
impression with their peers

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.041 align:middle line:90%
upon returning.

00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.670 align:middle line:84%
This educational plan
ran in combination

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:84%
with the careful
seeding of knowledge

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:84%
around the world by
the gods themselves,

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.860 align:middle line:84%
in what seems to have been a
carefully orchestrated plan

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to assist hunter
gatherers gradually evolve

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:90%
towards a more civilized state.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And too many traditions
describe this interaction

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.700 align:middle line:84%
involving the Watchers,
the Shining Ones,

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and others of their ilk,
for this to be mere hearsay

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.830 align:middle line:90%
or fabrication.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And once the seeds of
civilization had taken root,

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.370 align:middle line:84%
these unusual
people disappeared,

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.060 align:middle line:84%
never to be seen again in
physical form or thereafter

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.800 align:middle line:90%
appearing only sporadically.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:10%
You know, looking at the
myriad of ancient cultures

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.490 align:middle line:10%
and their stories, it
seems that as a species

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.240 align:middle line:10%
we ultimately became reliant
on outside assistance,

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:10%
perhaps to the
point of dependency,

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.340 align:middle line:10%
especially after each
overturning of the world.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:90%
So the question is this--

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.940 align:middle line:84%
what if the lesson to be
learned from this encounter

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
is for humans to discover the
creative spark of divinity

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:90%
within themselves?

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the gods of Orion
were offering us a challenge.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.240 align:middle line:90%
They're to be like us or better.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.990 align:middle line:90%
