<v ->He's been putting so much pressure on me.</v>

30
00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:53.771
<v ->You love him!</v>

31
00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:56.684
<v ->Yeah Katie, looking good.</v>

32
00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:58.377
<v ->Yeah, you too teddy bear.</v>

33
00:09:59.888 --> 00:10:03.113
<v ->He's disgusting, how could you talk to him like that?</v>

34
00:10:03.113 --> 00:10:03.596
<v ->Don't worry,</v>

35
00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:05.324
he won't even remember seeing me this morning.

(person imitating trumpet)

38
00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:19.105
<v ->Buenos dias señors y señoritas!</v>

39
00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:20.512
The student government is in session,

40
00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:22.799
would the council members please take your seats.

41
00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:27.143
Listen I'm gonna ask everybody to do some fundraising

42
00:10:27.143 --> 00:10:29.689
for a national charity called Doctor's Gift.

43
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.070
They provide surgical procedures for people,

44
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.502
mostly children in third world countries.

45
00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:39.278
Living where we do, in the cradle or Malibu,

46
00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:42.646
we can all use a little reality in our lives, agreed?

47
00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:43.720
Go ahead and pass these back,

48
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.645
anything that's left over hand up front, thank you.

49
00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:48.420
And we'll also talk about the prom,

50
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.692
I know that's on the agenda and on your minds,

51
00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.508
but you get community service hours for doing this,

52
00:10:53.508 --> 00:10:56.368
and it might actually make you feel good about yourselves.

53
00:10:56.368 --> 00:10:58.292
<v ->Why shouldn't we feel good about ourselves?</v>

54
00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:00.340
<v ->Why shouldn't we feel good about ourselves?</v>

55
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.964
Britney, I don't know that that's what I meant,

56
00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:03.244
maybe I was a little heavy handed.

57
00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:06.489
I've have a lot of students do this in previous years,

58
00:11:06.489 --> 00:11:07.880
and they've really gotten something out of it.

59
00:11:12.347 --> 00:11:14.222
<v ->Mr. Matthews, are these pictures real?</v>

60
00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:17.568
<v ->Yeah Katie, they're very real.</v>

61
00:11:17.568 --> 00:11:20.128
I've met some of the children in the photos.

62
00:11:20.128 --> 00:11:21.684
I've gone on the missions the last couple of years,

63
00:11:21.684 --> 00:11:22.984
taken some students,

64
00:11:22.984 --> 00:11:24.712
some people said it changed their lives.

65
00:11:24.712 --> 00:11:26.242
<v ->Yeah, they lost their lunch.</v>

66
00:11:26.242 --> 00:11:27.624
(laughter)

67
00:11:29.614 --> 00:11:31.558
<v ->Alright I know it's not for everybody,</v>

68
00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:34.118
but it's pretty cool.

69
00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:36.190
Been to some interesting places.

70
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.554
<v ->Cancun?</v>

71
00:11:37.554 --> 00:11:38.294
(laughter)

72
00:11:38.294 --> 00:11:41.208
<v ->No, we don't go to Cancun like it's spring break,</v>

73
00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:44.177
but we've gone to China, gone to Thailand.

74
00:11:44.177 --> 00:11:46.136
I know other students who've gone to the Philippines,

75
00:11:46.136 --> 00:11:48.063
Russia, Central and South America.

76
00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:51.485
Last year we went to China, we took two students,

77
00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:52.657
we set up surgical facilities,

78
00:11:52.657 --> 00:11:54.278
we performed dozens of operations

79
00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:56.415
to correct facial deformities.

80
00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:58.291
It changed a lot of lives.

81
00:11:58.291 --> 00:12:00.287
I don't expect you to give up your lives,

82
00:12:00.287 --> 00:12:01.982
and I'm not gonna hold it against you if you don't go,

83
00:12:01.982 --> 00:12:02.680
but...

84
00:12:03.832 --> 00:12:05.953
honestly I think it's a pretty great opportunity.

85
00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:10.503
Alright, the prom, the prom.

86
00:12:10.503 --> 00:12:12.360
Everybody have a dress picked out? John?

87
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.112
Just kidding.
(laughter)

88
00:12:14.112 --> 00:12:15.604
Who did we put in charge of committee assignments?

89
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:16.475
<v ->Oh, I am!</v>

90
00:12:17.722 --> 00:12:19.877
<v ->Oh good, what were you thinkin'?</v>

91
00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:22.821
<v ->Okay I'm thinking like this travel around the world thing,</v>

92
00:12:22.821 --> 00:12:24.932
and everybody can pick like their own different country

93
00:12:24.932 --> 00:12:26.148
that they want to represent and stuff.

94
00:12:26.148 --> 00:12:27.175
<v ->What else we got?</v>

95
00:12:27.175 --> 00:12:30.534
<v ->I'm thinking like this, uhm, Arabian Nights theme?</v>

96
00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:32.740
And we can have like Jasmine and Aladdin

97
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.179
and have magic carpet rides and everything,

98
00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:35.095
it'd be fun.

99
00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:36.767
<v ->Very good, nicely done.</v>

100
00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.548
<v ->It's time to go.</v>

101
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:48.249 line:15% 
(glass shattering)

102
00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.851
<v ->I want you to speak English.</v>

103
00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:58.203
<v ->Please don't make me do this daddy!</v>

104
00:12:59.442 --> 00:13:01.060
(crying)

105
00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:04.718
<v ->I understand you're scared.</v>

106
00:13:08.737 --> 00:13:10.232
<v ->You've done so much for me.</v>

107
00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:15.369
<v ->I've done nothing any father wouldn't have done.</v>

108
00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.257
All these years I dreamed that...

109
00:13:22.908 --> 00:13:24.830
you will be just like others too.

110
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.198
<v ->Please daddy, let me wear my hat?</v>

111
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.263
<v ->Don't worry.</v>

112
00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.952
Doctors in Shanghai will take good care of us.

113
00:13:58.414 --> 00:13:59.606
(foreign language)

114
00:14:43.017 --> 00:14:44.779

(train horn blows)
(rails squeaking)

118
00:16:32.966 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Daniel>Come on, we have to find the bus.</v>

119
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.678
We are already late.

120
00:16:36.678 --> 00:16:38.283
<v Lin>So many people.</v>

121
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:06.373
(bus horn honking)

122
00:17:06.373 --> 00:17:08.374
(screeching)

123
00:17:08.374 --> 00:17:09.830
(crashing)

124
00:17:11.007 --> 00:17:11.933
<v ->Papa!</v>

125
00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:13.617
(crying)

126
00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:17.284
(sad music)

127
00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:45.247
<v ->Hey Mr. Matthews!</v>

128
00:17:47.773 --> 00:17:49.841
<v ->Katie what's up? What can I do for you?</v>

129
00:17:49.841 --> 00:17:50.821
<v ->I was looking through that literature</v>

130
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:53.060
you passed out in student council today.

131
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.730
<v ->Think you're interested in Doctor's Gift?</v>

132
00:17:55.696 --> 00:17:57.483
<v ->Is it as sad as it looks?</v>

133
00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:01.713
<v ->Overall, I'd say it's pretty rewarding,</v>

134
00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:04.318
but I'd be lying if I said there weren't some sad moments.

135
00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:09.636
In China, this last trip, after we had packed up,

136
00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:11.456
I was coming down the hall and I saw this father

137
00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:12.957
and his teenage daughter.

138
00:18:12.957 --> 00:18:14.542
They had arrived after the doctors and staff

139
00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:15.812
had all gone home.

140
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.928
(sad music)

141
00:18:31.347 --> 00:18:33.168
<v ->Where is everyone?</v>

142
00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.884
<v ->They've all gone.</v>

143
00:18:43.884 --> 00:18:44.737
(laughs)

144
00:18:46.746 --> 00:18:48.021
<v ->Are you a doctor?</v>

145
00:18:49.006 --> 00:18:52.463
<v ->I'm a teacher, all the doctors have gone home.</v>

146
00:19:03.145 --> 00:19:04.481
He ended up in this horrible accident

147
00:19:04.481 --> 00:19:06.086
where his hand was crushed.

148
00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:08.947
His poor daughter who had waited for years

149
00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.895
to have this surgery had to be turned away.

150
00:19:12.008 --> 00:19:13.316
It broke my heart.

151
00:19:15.203 --> 00:19:16.730
<v ->What happened to them?</v>

152
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.758
<v ->There was a nurse waiting at the bus stop</v>

153
00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:19.802
on her way to the airport,

154
00:19:19.802 --> 00:19:22.129
she bandaged up the father's hand.

155
00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:23.274
<v ->What about the girl?</v>

156
00:19:25.929 --> 00:19:26.998
<v ->I don't know.</v>

157
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.520
I see wheels turning.

158
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.863
Will you let me know what you decide?

159
00:19:39.341 --> 00:19:41.227
Just think about it little more.

160
00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:42.106
See you.

161
00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.461
(truck starts)

162
00:20:08.451 --> 00:20:09.678
<v ->Where you been?</v>

163
00:20:09.678 --> 00:20:11.425
<v ->I was talking to Mr. Matthews.</v>

164
00:20:11.425 --> 00:20:12.448
<v ->What about?</v>

165
00:20:13.606 --> 00:20:15.845
<v ->Something bothering you?</v>

166
00:20:15.845 --> 00:20:18.210
<v ->Yeah, I've been waiting for 15 minutes.</v>

167
00:20:20.456 --> 00:20:22.025
<v ->Just pull over, let me out.</v>

168
00:20:22.025 --> 00:20:23.251
<v ->Relax, relax.</v>

169
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:24.940
<v ->Don't tell me to relax.</v>

170
00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.924
I hate it when you tell me to relax.

171
00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:30.848
<v ->I wait for 15 minutes, and you're pissed at me?</v>

172
00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:32.773
<v ->Just pull over, let me out.</v>

173
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.513
(dinging)

174
00:20:36.513 --> 00:20:37.548
(door slams)

175
00:20:45.002 --> 00:20:46.964
<v ->Katie, get in.</v>

176
00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:49.934
Katie, you're acting like a little girl,

177
00:20:49.934 --> 00:20:51.398
you gonna walk the whole way home?

178

295
00:28:45.018 --> 00:28:47.782
has changed so many lives so quickly.

296
00:28:48.983 --> 00:28:52.096
It takes such courage for these kids to come here.

297
00:28:52.096 --> 00:28:54.625
To step out of their lives for something new.

298
00:28:56.979 --> 00:28:58.687
I'll never forget one father,

299
00:28:58.687 --> 00:29:00.051
who traveled from Jingxi,

300
00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:02.143
a small town a few hours west of Shanghai,

301
00:29:02.143 --> 00:29:04.275
who had arrived with his teenage daughter

302
00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:07.742
after all the doctors and nurses had left the building.

303
00:29:07.742 --> 00:29:09.449
While traveling to the mission,

304
00:29:09.449 --> 00:29:11.241
they were in a horrible accident.

305
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:13.822
His arm was crushed, and his daughter,

306
00:29:13.822 --> 00:29:15.977
who had waited years to have the surgery,

307
00:29:15.977 --> 00:29:17.374
had to be turned away.

308
00:29:19.812 --> 00:29:21.782
Who knows how different her life would have been.

309
00:29:23.284 --> 00:29:26.828
If I ever had the ability to roll back the clock a little,

310
00:29:26.828 --> 00:29:28.034
this would have been the time.

00:32:00.338 --> 00:32:03.505
<v ->The same words can have more than one meaning?</v>

354
00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:05.776
I can be pro...

355
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.210
<v ->Pronounced.</v>

356
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.450
It can be pronounced differently.

357
00:32:19.701 --> 00:32:20.476
<v ->Never.</v>

358
00:32:27.482 --> 00:32:28.540

363

<v ->I don't know how to explain it exactly.</v>

364
00:32:59.296 --> 00:33:00.641
Nevermind.

372
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.917
Give it a try.

373
00:33:39.775 --> 00:33:40.846
Come on.

374
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.235

383
00:35:09.417 --> 00:35:11.273
<v ->What do you mean how I feel--</v>

384
00:35:11.273 --> 00:35:13.009
<v ->Why are you always trying to pick a fight,</v>

385
00:35:13.009 --> 00:35:14.136

386

<v ->Cut the psychology crap, Steven!</v>

387
00:35:21.296 --> 00:35:24.688
Alright, I'm out of control.

388
00:35:24.688 --> 00:35:27.176
But you know how angry I get when you stay out

389
00:35:27.176 --> 00:35:28.540
and don't call.

390
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.992
What happened last night, did you even think about us?

391
00:35:30.992 --> 00:35:35.350
<v ->What part of I'm sorry don't you understand?</v>

392
00:35:39.112 --> 00:35:41.288
<v ->Can't you just talk to me?</v>

393
00:35:41.288 --> 00:35:43.327
<v ->Not when you're like this.</v>

394
00:35:43.327 --> 00:35:45.661
It was wrong that I didn't call,

395
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:48.118
but you knew where I was, you knew who I was with,

396
00:35:48.118 --> 00:35:50.378
and after we have a couple drinks, you know?

397
00:35:50.378 --> 00:35:51.687
Sometimes, we--

398
00:35:51.687 --> 00:35:53.460
<v ->All act like fools!</v>

399
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.656
<v Both>Yeah!</v>

400
00:35:54.656 --> 00:35:57.617
<v ->Alright, yes, maybe sometimes we do, yes.</v>

401
00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:10.257
Has she started sleeping with Chris?

402
00:36:11.395 --> 00:36:12.893
<v ->No. I don't...</v>

403
00:36:13.833 --> 00:36:15.127
I don't think so.

404
00:36:18.665 --> 00:36:19.913
<v ->How do you feel about it?</v>

405
00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:21.508
<v ->Don't do that.</v>

406
00:36:21.508 --> 00:36:24.836
<v ->What is so strange about asking you how you feel?</v>

407
00:36:24.836 --> 00:36:27.533
<v ->It's all too familiar, Steven.</v>

408
00:36:28.474 --> 00:36:30.951
Every time I ask you about something sensitive,

409
00:36:30.951 --> 00:36:35.347
you turn it back on me like I'm one of your patients.

410
00:36:35.347 --> 00:36:37.479
I want you to talk to me!

411

412
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.556
I've never been a teenage girl.

413
00:36:41.556 --> 00:36:44.287
You know it's probably a good thing that she came to you.

414
00:36:44.287 --> 00:36:45.415
She wouldn't come to me.

415
00:36:45.415 --> 00:36:45.887
<v ->No.</v>

416
00:36:45.887 --> 00:36:46.676
<v ->No!</v>

417
00:36:46.676 --> 00:36:48.575
It's perfectly normal for a teenage girl

418
00:36:48.575 --> 00:36:51.495
to come to her mother about birth control.

419
00:36:51.495 --> 00:36:52.263
I mean who--

420
00:36:52.263 --> 00:36:53.715
<v ->You told him?</v>

421
00:36:53.715 --> 00:36:54.384
<v ->What are you?</v>

422
00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:59.189
<v ->How could you? You are unbelievable.</v>

423
00:36:59.189 --> 00:37:03.117
<v ->What do you mean I'm unbelievable, he's your father!</v>

424
00:37:03.117 --> 00:37:04.481
<v ->I trusted you.</v>

425
00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:07.893
<v ->Okay, you are out of control.</v>

426
00:37:07.893 --> 00:37:09.345
You are being very unfair.

427
00:37:09.345 --> 00:37:10.644
<v ->Oh, isn't that just like you.</v>

428
00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:12.525
You completely ratted me out,

429
00:37:12.525 --> 00:37:14.701
and now I'm the one who's unfair!

430
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:16.641
It's not unfair!

431
00:37:16.641 --> 00:37:17.610
<v ->Where are you going?</v>

432
00:37:19.255 --> 00:37:20.772
<v ->Don't look at me like that.</v>

433
00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:21.840
<v ->Like what?</v>

434
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.319

436
00:37:25.923 --> 00:37:26.947

437
00:37:26.947 --> 00:37:27.587
<v ->Hi Chris.</v>

438
00:37:27.587 --> 00:37:29.285
<v ->Shut up Steven.</v>

439
00:37:29.285 --> 00:37:29.958
Alright.

440
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.602

<v ->Thank you Chris.</v>

448
00:37:50.743 --> 00:37:52.712

00:37:57.601 --> 00:37:58.478

455

528
00:44:32.805 --> 00:44:34.695
(screaming)

529
00:44:55.417 --> 00:44:57.503
(gong rings)

530
00:45:04.786 --> 00:45:05.850
<v ->What are you writing?</v>

531
00:45:07.456 --> 00:45:09.515
<v ->I'm writing a letter to Doctor's Gift.</v>

532
00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:16.181
They will be in Shanghai very soon.

533
00:45:18.554 --> 00:45:19.262
<v ->That's...</v>

534
00:45:20.335 --> 00:45:21.153
Good?

535
00:45:26.513 --> 00:45:27.776
<v ->Are you okay?</v>

536
00:45:42.462 --> 00:45:43.418
<v ->Sha Lin...</v>

537
00:45:45.024 --> 00:45:47.465
what happened last night was not your fault.

538
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:53.242
Stop your busy work.

539
00:45:53.242 --> 00:45:56.436
Sha Lin, I think we should talk about last night.

540
00:45:57.628 --> 00:46:01.077
It's okay, you did nothing wrong.

541
00:46:01.077 --> 00:46:04.228
Sha Lin! Sha Lin! Sha Lin!

542
00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:06.166
(foreign language)

543
00:46:09.812 --> 00:46:12.324
<v ->I just wanna stay here.</v>

544
00:46:12.324 --> 00:46:14.862
I can read, I can make your tea.

545
00:46:16.033 --> 00:46:18.347
I'll write English.

546
00:46:20.977 --> 00:46:22.892
Clean the house. I'm happy here.

547
00:46:22.892 --> 00:46:24.384
I'm happy here.

548
00:46:24.384 --> 00:46:28.738
Please, don't make me go.

549
00:46:28.738 --> 00:46:32.683
I'll be so happy if you find your own life.

550
00:46:32.683 --> 00:46:35.219
Please don't send the letter, please, don't!

551
00:46:35.219 --> 00:46:39.903
<v ->Okay, okay! Okay! Okay.</v>

552
00:46:42.572 --> 00:46:44.055
You did nothing wrong.

553
00:46:47.877 --> 00:46:49.427
Nothing happened!

554
00:47:10.614 --> 00:47:13.785
I'm off to work, I'll be back later.

555
00:47:13.785 --> 00:47:15.549
We can talk then.

556
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:16.688
<v ->Yes father.</v>

557
00:47:21.653 --> 00:47:24.418
(solemn music)

558
00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:23.875
(machines working)

559
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.112
(foreign language)

560
00:52:17.105 --> 00:52:19.787
(slow music)

561
00:52:37.084 --> 00:52:39.919
♫ Spend some time with me ♫

562
00:52:39.919 --> 00:52:41.416
(laughing)

563
00:52:41.416 --> 00:52:42.880
<v ->How are you gettin' home?</v>

564
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.675
<v ->Chris is gonna pick me up.</v>

565
00:52:44.675 --> 00:52:46.500
<v ->Hey! I like that song.</v>

566
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.858
<v ->Yeah, it's pretty good.</v>

567
00:52:47.858 --> 00:52:49.418
<v ->Well put it back!</v>

568
00:52:49.418 --> 00:52:50.093
<v ->No, mom!</v>

569
00:52:50.093 --> 00:52:51.664
I'll be out in two seconds and you can put on

570
00:52:51.664 --> 00:52:52.772
whatever you want.

571
00:52:52.772 --> 00:52:55.252
<v ->Ugh, Katie. Katie.</v>

572
00:52:55.252 --> 00:52:55.997
<v ->Mom!</v>

573
00:52:57.027 --> 00:52:59.085
<v ->Listen are you okay with everything today?</v>

574
00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:01.084
<v ->Yeah.</v>

575
00:53:01.084 --> 00:53:03.132
<v ->Alright, well don't screw around with anything.</v>

576
00:53:03.132 --> 00:53:06.327
Take the pill every morning.

577
00:53:06.327 --> 00:53:08.056
<v ->I was there too.</v>

578
00:53:08.056 --> 00:53:10.424
<v ->It also helps keep your skin clear.</v>

579
00:53:10.424 --> 00:53:13.423
(laughs)

580
00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:16.923
Katie don't be afraid to come to me with anything, okay?

581
00:53:16.923 --> 00:53:20.267
We've always been able to say anything to each other.

582
00:53:21.445 --> 00:53:23.281
You know what I mean?

583
00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:25.541
<v ->Yeah, I know what you mean mom.</v>

584
00:53:25.541 --> 00:53:27.583
<v ->Kay, I'm glad.</v>

585
00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:29.597
<v ->Me too.</v>

586
00:53:29.597 --> 00:53:31.727
<v ->Don't patronize me.</v>

587
00:53:31.727 --> 00:53:32.480
<v ->I'm not.</v>

588
00:53:33.745 --> 00:53:36.329
I'm not. You've always been pretty cool.

589
00:53:39.427 --> 00:53:41.091
♫ Where they at? West coast!

590
00:53:41.091 --> 00:53:42.819
♫ Where they at? West coast!

591
00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:44.635
♫ Where they at? East coast!

592
00:53:44.635 --> 00:53:47.983
♫ Lookin' good Louis!

593
00:53:47.983 --> 00:53:51.607
♫ Run playa, run playa, run playa, run ♫

594
00:53:51.607 --> 00:53:53.296
Alright, later mom.

595
00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:53.964
<v ->Later.</v>

596
00:53:58.463 --> 00:53:59.278
<v ->What?</v>

597
00:54:01.524 --> 00:54:03.318
<v ->What what?</v>

598
00:54:03.318 --> 00:54:04.394
<v ->You're looking at me like aw,</v>

599
00:54:04.394 --> 00:54:06.461
my little girl's so grown up now.

600
00:54:12.439 --> 00:54:14.871
<v ->Uh, can I change the music back?</v>

601
00:54:14.871 --> 00:54:15.796
<v ->Sure.</v>

602
00:54:21.976 --> 00:54:25.661
<v Mr. Matthews>Good morning everybody!</v>

603
00:54:25.661 --> 00:54:27.625
Saturday morning, so good to see you,

604
00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:28.733
I can't believe you made it in here,

605
00:54:28.733 --> 00:54:29.673
thank you so much,

606
00:54:29.673 --> 00:54:31.741
I can't tell you how much it means to me.

607
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:33.423
'Course this wouldn't have anything to do

608
00:54:33.423 --> 00:54:35.279
with the fact that you have community service hours

609
00:54:35.279 --> 00:54:36.358
you need to graduate?

610
00:54:36.358 --> 00:54:37.880
There you are! Take that Kate.

611
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.690
Ted, one for you. New shampoo?

612
00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.330
Here. Take that.

613
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.295
Go ahead and fill out the applications.

614
00:54:44.295 --> 00:54:47.047
And for the boys who might not understand the questions,

615
00:54:47.047 --> 00:54:48.518
take all the extra time you need.

616
00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:49.370
Maybe even ask one of the girls,

617
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.504
they know how to help.

618
00:54:52.414 --> 00:54:53.747
<v ->Look, they'll let anyone in.</v>

619
00:54:53.747 --> 00:54:55.300
Must need a lot of help.

620
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.195
<v ->Hey! What was that?</v>

621
00:54:57.195 --> 00:55:00.588
Doctor's Gift does need a lot of help, everybody, alright?

622
00:55:00.588 --> 00:55:03.125
They need help training, fundraising,

623
00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:05.393
mission coordinating, and for a very lucky few,

624
00:55:05.393 --> 00:55:07.505
Oh! Barbera, (whistles) Barbera, hi.

625
00:55:07.505 --> 00:55:09.533
For the lucky few who get to go on the trip,

626
00:55:09.533 --> 00:55:12.583
it is a life altering experience, I promise you that.

627
00:55:12.583 --> 00:55:13.972
Alright, maybe I've over stated it,

628
00:55:13.972 --> 00:55:15.259
but it can be quite an adventure.

629
00:55:15.259 --> 00:55:15.943
Ted?

630
00:55:16.952 --> 00:55:20.633
<v ->Mr. Matthews, how many hours do we get for this?</v>

631
00:55:20.633 --> 00:55:22.961
<v ->One hour Ted. One hour only.</v>

632
00:55:22.961 --> 00:55:25.649
So please put your student ID numbers on the applications

633
00:55:25.649 --> 00:55:28.708
and that why it might jog my failing memory,

634
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:31.039
and maybe you'll get the credit you so rightfully deserve.

635
00:55:31.039 --> 00:55:32.838
Ted, another question?

636
00:55:32.838 --> 00:55:36.200
<v ->Uh, Mr. Matthews, can I borrow a pencil?</v>

637
00:55:37.206 --> 00:55:39.533
<v ->Aw, everybody, Ted forgot his pencil.</v>

638
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.916
(laughter)

639
00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:43.981
A plethora of pencils for Ted!

640
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:47.185
(laughing)

641
00:55:47.185 --> 00:55:48.118
<v ->Thank you.</v>

642
00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.719
<v ->Alright guys that's it.</v>

643
00:55:53.719 --> 00:55:55.566
Don't forget to turn in your applications.

644
00:56:13.313 --> 00:56:16.193
<v ->Are there other requirements besides just showing up?</v>

645
00:56:17.735 --> 00:56:18.759
<v ->What do you mean?</v>

646
00:56:18.759 --> 00:56:21.288
<v ->Well, do you have to pass any kind of test?</v>

647
00:56:21.288 --> 00:56:23.061
Or do you have to be presentable,

648
00:56:23.061 --> 00:56:25.073
have certain qualities?

649
00:56:25.073 --> 00:56:26.545
<v ->You're gonna be great.</v>

650
00:56:26.545 --> 00:56:27.782
<v ->Not me.</v>

651
00:56:29.284 --> 00:56:30.564
<v ->Well why are you asking?</v>

652
00:56:30.564 --> 00:56:31.421
<v ->Ted.</v>

653
00:56:33.942 --> 00:56:36.654
I mean, would someone like him be allowed to go

654
00:56:36.654 --> 00:56:38.487
and represent Doctor's Gift?

655
00:56:39.601 --> 00:56:41.640
<v ->You mean like on a mission?</v>

656
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.978
<v ->Yeah, like on a mission.</v>

657
00:56:44.093 --> 00:56:45.665
<v ->Don't always be so quick to judge.</v>

658
00:56:46.675 --> 00:56:48.287
Ted's a pretty interesting guy.

659
00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:52.029
He's got three honors classes,

660
00:56:52.029 --> 00:56:54.217
carries a 4.0.

661
00:56:54.217 --> 00:56:55.798
He's done over 300 hours of community service,

662
00:56:55.798 --> 00:56:56.925
of all the students in class today

663
00:56:56.925 --> 00:56:58.313
he's probably the only one who didn't need the hours

664
00:56:58.313 --> 00:56:59.189
to graduate.

665
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.451
<v ->I really didn't know.</v>

666
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:04.180
<v ->Well now you do.</v>

667
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.454
<v ->Anyway, uhm...</v>

668
00:57:07.099 --> 00:57:09.559
I'm not sure if this is something that I can do.

669
00:57:11.121 --> 00:57:12.109
<v ->That's alright.</v>

670
00:57:13.267 --> 00:57:15.489
You don't lose any points for changing your mind.

671
00:57:20.487 --> 00:57:22.417
I wanna show you something.

672
00:57:22.417 --> 00:57:23.358
Remember this story I told you

673
00:57:23.358 --> 00:57:25.011
about the Chinese girl and her dad?

674
00:57:25.011 --> 00:57:27.455
Didn't make it to Shanghai in time for her operation?

675
00:57:27.455 --> 00:57:28.409
<v ->Yeah.</v>

676
00:57:29.591 --> 00:57:30.958
<v ->This is her file.</v>

677
00:57:32.673 --> 00:57:33.996
I'd like to get your reaction on it.

678
00:57:33.996 --> 00:57:37.210
If you decide to go forward you can write your essay on it.

679
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.500
<v ->Okay. Thanks Mr. Matthews.</v>

680
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:44.014
(piano music)

681
00:58:04.639 --> 00:58:06.383
Are you sure no one's home?

682
00:58:14.054 --> 00:58:15.834
<v ->You're unbelievable.</v>

683
00:58:15.834 --> 00:58:17.162
<v ->You think so?</v>

684
00:58:27.961 --> 00:58:29.672
I think we should wait.

685
00:58:33.753 --> 00:58:34.589
<v ->What?</v>

686
00:58:36.348 --> 00:58:38.072
<v ->I think we should wait.</v>

687
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:43.927
<v ->I can't believe you're doin' this.</v>

688
00:58:43.927 --> 00:58:45.309
<v ->I'm not doing anything.</v>

689
00:58:48.465 --> 00:58:49.813
I need to go home.

690
00:59:02.173 --> 00:59:03.459
(tires screeching)

691
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:19.918
<v ->Katie?</v>

692
00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:28.611
Katie?

693
00:59:32.521 --> 00:59:33.189
Hey.

694
00:59:35.115 --> 00:59:35.870
Hey.

695
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.564
You okay?

696
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.792
<v ->I don't think I'm ready.</v>

697
00:59:49.355 --> 00:59:51.666
<v ->Well you don't have to do this pumpkin head.</v>

698
00:59:54.936 --> 00:59:57.098
<v ->That's not what I'm talking about mom.</v>

699
00:59:57.098 --> 00:59:58.798
I'm going to China.

700
00:59:58.798 --> 00:59:59.604
<v ->Oh.</v>

701
01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:03.628
Oh, was it Chris?

702
01:00:13.524 --> 01:00:15.434
<v ->I just didn't want to.</v>

703
01:00:15.434 --> 01:00:17.397
<v ->Was Chris too aggressive?</v>

704
01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:21.332
<v ->No. Just more like he didn't know what to do.</v>

705
01:00:21.332 --> 01:00:24.148
After the initial shock he was really pretty understanding.

706
01:00:24.148 --> 01:00:24.788
<v ->That's good.</v>

707
01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.113
<v ->That's good.</v>

708
01:00:26.113 --> 01:00:29.293
<v ->What? Why do you always sneak up on us.</v>

709
01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.233
<v ->I didn't sneak up on you, I was parking the car!</v>

710
01:00:31.233 --> 01:00:32.064
<v ->Knock it off.</v>

711
01:00:33.222 --> 01:00:34.338
<v ->Next please!</v>

712
01:00:37.096 --> 01:00:38.464
Hi, how many traveling?

713
01:00:38.464 --> 01:00:39.578
<v ->Just one.</v>

714
01:00:39.578 --> 01:00:41.033
<v ->Ticket and passport, please.</v>

715
01:00:49.162 --> 01:00:50.846
Okay, Katherine,

716
01:00:50.846 --> 01:00:52.017
anyone unpack your bags

717
01:00:52.017 --> 01:00:54.385
or give you anything to take on the plane?

718
01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:55.260
<v ->My mom.</v>

719
01:00:56.206 --> 01:00:57.689
<v ->This your mom?</v>

720
01:00:57.689 --> 01:01:00.421
Wow, look like a sister.

721
01:01:00.421 --> 01:01:02.425
So mom, before I call security,

722
01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:05.285
you get anything from anybody to take on the plane?

723
01:01:05.285 --> 01:01:05.982
<v ->No.</v>

724
01:01:05.982 --> 01:01:08.582
<v ->No American candy, no play station?</v>

725
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:09.670
<v ->No, nothing.</v>

726
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.998
<v ->No gummy bear, beanie baby?</v>

727
01:01:11.998 --> 01:01:14.558
What's those nice boots called, a Ugg?

728
01:01:14.558 --> 01:01:15.872
<v ->No, no.</v>

729
01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:19.997
<v ->No, okay. Come on, who died?</v>

730
01:01:19.997 --> 01:01:20.858
(laughter)

731
01:01:22.296 --> 01:01:23.625
Okay, Katherine.

732
01:01:24.635 --> 01:01:29.026
Flight 832, through security gate 123 on your left.

733
01:01:29.026 --> 01:01:32.294
And sounds like you're getting on just in time.

734
01:01:37.504 --> 01:01:40.595
<v ->Boy, travel sure isn't what it used to be.</v>

735
01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:42.884
<v ->Yeah, passengers not the same either.</v>

736
01:01:42.884 --> 01:01:45.501
Take care, have nice trip. Next please.

737
01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:48.023
<v Chris>Katie!</v>

738
01:01:51.317 --> 01:01:53.087
Katie!

739
01:01:53.087 --> 01:01:53.992
<v Mrs. Nelson>I don't know why she had</v>

740
01:01:53.992 --> 01:01:55.421
to be such a smart ass.

741
01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:57.880
<v Steven>Why didn't you just try to be friendly?</v>

742
01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.743
<v ->Katie!</v>

743
01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:02.352
I'm sorry.

744
01:02:05.641 --> 01:02:07.928
<v ->It's okay Chris, you were great.</v>

745
01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:10.343
<v ->Hey Chris.</v>

746
01:02:13.574 --> 01:02:14.707
<v ->I love you.</v>

747
01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:16.460
<v ->Bye bye sweetie.</v>

748
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.846
You got everything?

749
01:02:17.846 --> 01:02:19.430
<v ->Write to me.</v>

750
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:20.194
<v ->Okay.</v>

751
01:02:31.562 --> 01:02:32.701
<v ->Bye sweetie!</v>

752
01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:34.074
<v ->Bye honey!</v>

753
01:02:48.477 --> 01:02:52.005
<v ->I have been such a jerk.</v>

754
01:02:56.723 --> 01:02:58.771
<v ->Some days are harder than others.</v>

755
01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.188
<v Steven>Pumpkin head,</v>

756
01:03:10.188 --> 01:03:13.817
your mother and I have spent the past 17 years

757
01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:15.653
watching you grow into the fine,

758
01:03:15.653 --> 01:03:18.273
compassionate young woman that you are.

759
01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:23.992
Wherever you go, no doubt, you'll light up the world.

760
01:03:23.992 --> 01:03:26.407
Love, mom and dad.

761
01:04:04.689 --> 01:04:07.236
(dizi music)

762
01:04:22.997 --> 01:04:25.560
<v ->Hi! I am here!</v>

763
01:04:27.894 --> 01:04:29.486
This way, this way!

764
01:04:29.486 --> 01:04:30.708
Come on, this way!

765
01:04:35.214 --> 01:04:36.361
Hey, here, here.

766
01:04:37.648 --> 01:04:39.428
Hi, I'm Calvin.

767
01:04:39.428 --> 01:04:40.437
<v ->Hi, I'm Katie.</v>

768
01:04:40.437 --> 01:04:41.364
<v ->Nice to meet you.</v>

769
01:04:41.364 --> 01:04:42.816
<v ->Nice to meet you too.</v>

770
01:04:42.816 --> 01:04:47.459
<v ->And you are, Sir Swore?</v>

771
01:04:47.459 --> 01:04:48.257
<v ->Ted.</v>

772
01:04:48.257 --> 01:04:50.625
<v ->Oh, Ted! Much better.</v>

773
01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.075
Sweet name, nice to meet you.

774
01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:52.856
<v ->Nice to meet you too.</v>

775
01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.124
<v ->Okay, please this way.</v>

776
01:04:56.242 --> 01:04:57.708
Okay guys, this way.

777
01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.003
Welcome to Shanghai, yay!

778
01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:09.455
(cheering)

779
01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:15.443
One more time.

780
01:05:15.443 --> 01:05:17.402
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

781
01:05:17.402 --> 01:05:19.514
brother and sister, welcome to Shanghai!

782
01:05:19.514 --> 01:05:21.671
(cheering)

783
01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:25.402
Doctor, nurses, volunteers and students,

784
01:05:25.402 --> 01:05:26.922
welcome to here in China.

785
01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:28.734
I have a question, hey pretty girl.

786
01:05:28.734 --> 01:05:30.846
Are you a doctor? Doctor?

787
01:05:30.846 --> 01:05:33.865
<v ->Am I a doctor? No, I'm a registered nurse.</v>

788
01:05:33.865 --> 01:05:35.546
<v ->How about you?</v>

789
01:05:35.546 --> 01:05:36.821
<v ->Yeah.</v>

790
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:40.392
<v ->Okay, we'll be travelling by bus for about one hour</v>

791
01:05:40.392 --> 01:05:43.252
to hotel, and the hotel, oh!

792
01:05:43.252 --> 01:05:45.596
Traffic in China is always heavy.

793
01:05:45.596 --> 01:05:47.131
<v ->How heavy is it?</v>

794
01:05:47.131 --> 01:05:48.328
<v ->Yeah, so heavy.</v>

795
01:05:48.328 --> 01:05:51.889
And the hotel is not too far from the hospital.

796
01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:56.497
The dinner will be served shortly

797
01:05:56.497 --> 01:05:59.383
and after our raffle.

798
01:05:59.383 --> 01:06:03.663
And you want lots of supplies of ready passengers.

799
01:06:03.663 --> 01:06:06.821
Welcome to, thank you for coming, and enjoy the ride!

800
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:08.617
(clapping)

801
01:06:15.688 --> 01:06:17.007
<v ->Where you from?</v>

802
01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:17.800
<v ->L.A.</v>

803
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.078
<v ->Hi L.A., I'm Linda from Salt Lake.</v>

804
01:06:21.153 --> 01:06:23.014
<v ->Hi Linda from Salt Lake.</v>

805
01:06:23.014 --> 01:06:24.526
I'm Katie and this is Ted.

806
01:06:24.526 --> 01:06:26.055
<v ->Hi Ted, hi Katie.</v>

807
01:06:26.055 --> 01:06:26.951
I saw you guys on the plane,

808
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:28.357
I thought you might be one of us.

809
01:06:29.495 --> 01:06:30.546
<v ->One of you.</v>

810
01:06:31.766 --> 01:06:33.921
<v ->Hey how about the MC, what a hoot, huh?</v>

811
01:06:34.927 --> 01:06:37.523
I think he said the first lady was at the hospital.

812
01:06:37.523 --> 01:06:40.864
I'm not sure but if she is, I hope she's alright.

813
01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:42.904
I'll see you guys there, okay?

814
01:06:42.904 --> 01:06:44.187
<v ->Alright. See ya.</v>

815
01:06:45.946 --> 01:06:48.219
(dizi music)

816
01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:17.366
<v ->Do you guys know any movie stars?</v>

817
01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:20.325
Hey Katie, you know we can room together if you want.

818
01:07:20.325 --> 01:07:21.925
This is my third mission for Doctor's Gift,

819
01:07:21.925 --> 01:07:24.632
and each time I go I meet the most interesting people,

820
01:07:24.632 --> 01:07:26.085
and we have so much fun at night,

821
01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:27.429
sometimes we have a little too much fun,

822
01:07:27.429 --> 01:07:29.264
but let's keep that on the DL okay?

823
01:07:29.264 --> 01:07:30.992
I take a lot of pictures, too.

824
01:07:30.992 --> 01:07:32.380
Hey let's take a picture right now!

825
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.945
Katie, Ted, get over there, let's take a picture right now!

826
01:07:35.945 --> 01:07:38.332
Go ahead Calvin, go ahead!

827
01:07:38.332 --> 01:07:42.492
Alright but you have to say, you know, hey!

828
01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:44.785
Hey let's get everybody in, everybody get in!

829
01:07:44.785 --> 01:07:45.809
Behind there.

830
01:07:45.809 --> 01:07:47.198
Okay you guys this is Katie and Ted,

831
01:07:47.198 --> 01:07:49.545
they're from L.A., and then Calvin's from China.

832
01:07:49.545 --> 01:07:51.657
Okay, what are you gonna say?

833
01:07:51.657 --> 01:07:52.865
(shouting)

834
01:07:52.865 --> 01:07:55.473
Alright I think the fun has officially started!

835
01:07:59.506 --> 01:08:00.859
<v ->You got it?</v>

836
01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:01.929
<v ->Is this it?</v>

837
01:08:03.367 --> 01:08:04.647
<v ->What do you mean?</v>

838
01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.986
<v ->I mean, is this it?</v>

839
01:08:06.986 --> 01:08:08.969
<v ->What, it's not so bad.</v>

840
01:08:08.969 --> 01:08:10.934
You know whenever I take a trip,

841
01:08:10.934 --> 01:08:13.089
I always look at everything as an adventure,

842
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.020
that way I'm never disappointed.

843
01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:16.772
<v ->Wow.</v>

844
01:08:17.911 --> 01:08:20.739
<v ->Oh, do you want this bed? What bed you want?</v>

845
01:08:20.739 --> 01:08:22.659
Do you mind if I take that one?

846
01:08:22.659 --> 01:08:25.135
Because at home I always sleep facing west,

847
01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:27.331
and since we're in China,

848
01:08:27.331 --> 01:08:29.671
I should probably face east.

849
01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:31.438
Luckily I brought a compass.

850
01:08:35.348 --> 01:08:36.967
Let me know if you want any soup.

851
01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:40.099
Oh you have a computer?

852
01:08:40.099 --> 01:08:42.595
I'm always on my computer at home.

853
01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.004
You ever wonder how we got along without computers

854
01:08:45.004 --> 01:08:45.702
and...

855
01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:48.077
And cellphones, and...

856
01:08:49.343 --> 01:08:50.413
What are you looking for?

857
01:08:51.443 --> 01:08:53.148
<v ->I wanted to send some emails.</v>

858
01:08:55.813 --> 01:08:57.933
Ugh, there's nowhere to plug this thing in.

859
01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.411
(shutter click)

860
01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:02.246
<v ->Great shot!</v>

861
01:09:02.246 --> 01:09:05.350
<v ->Linda, I'm sorry can you please put that thing away.</v>

862
01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.984
<v ->It was a great shot.</v>

863
01:09:06.984 --> 01:09:08.540
<v ->Hey Ted!</v>

864
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.044
<v ->Hi.</v>

865
01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.272
<v ->Hey, how's it goin'?</v>

866
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.264
<v ->Good, you?</v>

867
01:09:11.264 --> 01:09:12.189
<v ->Good!</v>

868
01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:14.955
<v ->Katie, can I help you?</v>

869
01:09:16.093 --> 01:09:17.655
<v ->Yeah, that'd be nice.</v>

870
01:09:24.425 --> 01:09:26.389
<v ->You know what, you're a take charge kinda guy there Ted,</v>

871
01:09:26.389 --> 01:09:28.133
I can tell already.

872
01:09:28.133 --> 01:09:29.077
<v ->Just trying to help.</v>

873
01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:34.307
<v ->Coming guys! Coming to dinner?</v>

874
01:09:34.307 --> 01:09:35.376
<v ->Oh I'm definitely in.</v>

875
01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:38.171
<v ->It's gonna be good tonight.</v>

876
01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:39.555
<v ->Why, what are we having?</v>

877
01:09:39.555 --> 01:09:42.793
<v ->I dunno. The first meal always good.</v>

878
01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.458
<v ->The first smell's always good?</v>

879
01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:46.286
<v ->Uh huh!</v>

880
01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:50.300
<v ->You mean the first meals always good?</v>

881
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.636
<v ->Uh, yeah! Meal.</v>

882
01:09:51.636 --> 01:09:52.746
<v ->Is that what you meant to say?</v>

883
01:09:52.746 --> 01:09:55.050
You know what, I can't make out what you're saying.

884
01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:58.372
But, I am starved, so I'm definitely in.

885
01:09:58.372 --> 01:10:00.940
<v ->Could you guys please take your party somewhere else?</v>

886
01:10:08.753 --> 01:10:09.994
<v ->Come on you guys, let's go.</v>

887
01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:13.315
Let's go.

888
01:10:15.389 --> 01:10:16.713
<v ->You know it must be hard doin' something</v>

889
01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.455
that's not all about you.

890
01:10:37.052 --> 01:10:38.570
<v ->What am I doing here?</v>

891
01:10:52.104 --> 01:10:53.384
<v ->Good, you guys are here.</v>

892
01:10:53.384 --> 01:10:55.983
Katie, you will be working in the receiving room,

893
01:10:55.983 --> 01:10:58.248
upstairs, down the hall, okay?

894
01:10:58.248 --> 01:11:00.824
Here is a list of the procedures

895
01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.504
on the schedule for this morning.

896
01:11:02.504 --> 01:11:05.960
Ted, you'll be moving patients to their rooms for prep.

897
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.082
Wait, where you going grasshopper?

898
01:11:08.082 --> 01:11:10.204
As well as working with the kitchen staff

899
01:11:10.204 --> 01:11:11.242
when lunch is served.

900
01:11:11.242 --> 01:11:13.277
Yes we're gonna have cabbage again, I don't wanna hear it.

901
01:11:13.277 --> 01:11:15.709
Now each patient has a number that corresponds

902
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:17.216
with the number on the schedule,

903
01:11:17.216 --> 01:11:18.403
so just be aware of that

904
01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:20.209
and try and make sure everything flows.

905
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.090
And make sure that each patient

906
01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:23.902
has a bloody type armband on their wrist

907
01:11:23.902 --> 01:11:26.838
as they're wheeled into the operating room, okay?

908
01:11:26.838 --> 01:11:29.367
You guys, do me a favor, try to keep a smile on.

909
01:11:29.367 --> 01:11:31.553
These kids are really scared, alright?

910
01:11:33.067 --> 01:11:34.430
<v ->Excuse me, how about me?</v>

911
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:35.350
<v ->How about you?</v>

912
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:37.765
You're so cute I'm gonna scream, come with me.

913
01:11:47.856 --> 01:11:49.064

914
01:11:49.064 --> 01:11:50.478

915
01:11:55.348 --> 01:11:56.709
You wanna draw a picture?

916
01:12:04.168 --> 01:12:05.664

917
01:12:12.122 --> 01:12:15.252
(calm piano music)

918
01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:17.982
Minh, Hi.

919
01:12:19.756 --> 01:12:21.244
Can I see your hand?

920
01:12:23.618 --> 01:12:25.124

921
01:12:25.124 --> 01:12:26.584

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:28.812

<v ->Okay, number 003, Minh?</v>

928
01:13:59.191 --> 01:14:00.270

929
01:14:03.713 --> 01:14:05.236
Katie can I have Minh's chart?

930
01:14:09.274 --> 01:14:10.249
Katie?

931
01:14:13.731 --> 01:14:14.597
Katie?

932
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:17.683
Are you okay sweetheart?

933
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.772
<v ->I can't do this.</v>

934
01:14:23.314 --> 01:14:25.715
It's different when you see them close up.

935
01:14:28.521 --> 01:14:29.639
<v ->Hold on a minute.</v>

936
01:14:41.048 --> 01:14:42.232
Here's what we're gonna do.

937
01:14:45.994 --> 01:14:47.786
Okay we're gonna take the pictures in here,

938
01:14:47.786 --> 01:14:49.347
and you're gonna do it.

939
01:14:49.347 --> 01:14:50.020
Watch.

940
01:14:52.142 --> 01:14:55.171
Hi! Come here.

941
01:14:55.171 --> 01:14:58.970
Stand right over here. Good boy.

942
01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.206
(gasps)

943
01:15:08.106 --> 01:15:08.823
(shutter click)

944
01:15:08.823 --> 01:15:09.844
(gasps)

945
01:15:11.494 --> 01:15:14.096
Thank you so much!

946
01:15:14.096 --> 01:15:16.443
Hi, excuse me? Hi pretty girl!

947
01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:18.896
Oh, I was gonna wear my hair like that today.

948
01:15:18.896 --> 01:15:20.667
It's a good thing I didn't.

949
01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:21.965
Okay, turn around.

950
01:15:29.569 --> 01:15:31.811
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

951
01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:36.206
Here you go. Excuse me, excuse me mister.

952
01:15:36.206 --> 01:15:37.143
Guess what?

953
01:15:37.143 --> 01:15:39.416
You have to come with me because I'm bigger than you.

954
01:15:41.295 --> 01:15:42.886
Here we go, turn around.

955
01:15:44.537 --> 01:15:46.471
Here. Go ahead.

956
01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:48.447
Ready?

957
01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:56.219
Very good! I think you can handle it from here.

958
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:03.554
<v ->Katie!</v>

959
01:16:08.073 --> 01:16:08.884
<v ->Ni hao?</v>

960
01:16:08.884 --> 01:16:10.263
<v Together>Ni hao!</v>

01:16:10.263 --> 01:16:10.967
<v ->Hello!</v>

962
01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.765
<v Together>Hello!</v>

963
01:16:15.755 --> 01:16:17.475
<v ->Today changed my life.</v>

964
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.056
Please tell Mr. Matthews he was right.

965
01:16:22.022 --> 01:16:24.897
I love you mom, tell dad I love him too.

966
01:16:24.897 --> 01:16:26.723
And I really love the picture.

967
01:16:34.473 --> 01:16:35.358
<v ->Hey.</v>

968
01:16:37.028 --> 01:16:40.961
Oh my gosh, I am so tired.

969
01:16:42.292 --> 01:16:43.326
Ugh.

970
01:16:47.193 --> 01:16:49.069
You were good today.

971
01:16:49.069 --> 01:16:50.837
<v ->Thanks.</v>

972
01:16:50.837 --> 01:16:52.565
You're pretty cool.

973
01:16:52.565 --> 01:16:54.549
<v ->I'm sorry, didn't hear that?</v>

974
01:16:54.549 --> 01:16:55.892
<v ->You were very cool.</v>

975
01:16:56.902 --> 01:16:57.459
<v ->Thanks.</v>

976
01:16:58.721 --> 01:17:00.695
Who are you writing to?

977
01:17:00.695 --> 01:17:02.277
<v ->I just wrote an email to my parents,</v>

978
01:17:02.277 --> 01:17:04.432
and I think I'm gonna write one to the teacher

979
01:17:04.432 --> 01:17:06.767
who talked me into coming here.

980
01:17:06.767 --> 01:17:07.855
<v ->Who's that?</v>

981
01:17:07.855 --> 01:17:09.118
<v ->Mr. Matthews.</v>

982
01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:11.672
<v ->Michael Matthews?</v>

983
01:17:12.786 --> 01:17:14.123
<v ->Yeah, you know him?</v>

984
01:17:14.123 --> 01:17:16.832
<v ->Yeah, we work together in China.</v>

985
01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.823
He's a really really good guy.

986
01:17:20.258 --> 01:17:23.527
God I remember one day I was on my way to the airport,

987
01:17:23.527 --> 01:17:28.527
and he grabbed me to help him bandage this guys arm

988
01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:31.762
who was just hit by a bus, it was horrible.

989
01:17:31.762 --> 01:17:33.112
<v ->Did you get to meet them?</v>

990
01:17:34.314 --> 01:17:34.940
<v ->Meet who?</v>

991
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.953
<v ->Lin, did you get to meet him?</v>

992
01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:41.739
<v ->I remember he was with a young girl.</v>

993
01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:46.555
No, you know what I didn't see her face.

994
01:17:48.116 --> 01:17:49.606
I mean it coulda been her, but...

995
01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.360
I don't know.

996
01:17:53.499 --> 01:17:55.227
I just remember that her father's arm

997
01:17:55.227 --> 01:17:57.972
was really badly broken, though.

998
01:17:57.972 --> 01:18:00.844
I'm so tired honey, could you get the lights?

999
01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:01.516
<v ->Okay, good night.</v>

1000
01:18:01.516 --> 01:18:02.623
<v ->Good night.</v>

1001
01:18:22.862 --> 01:18:24.294
<v ->Good morning, miss.</v>

1002
01:18:24.294 --> 01:18:25.007
<v ->Good morning.</v>

1003
01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:27.321
Can you tell me where this is?

1004
01:18:34.399 --> 01:18:36.634
<v ->Jingxi is very far.</v>

1005
01:18:36.634 --> 01:18:38.907
<v ->How far? Can you tell me how to get there?</v>

1006
01:18:38.907 --> 01:18:41.379
<v ->Yes miss, but, the distance is great,</v>

1007
01:18:41.379 --> 01:18:44.451
and the bus we rent earlier this morning for your group

1008
01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:47.530
is going to the Culture Center in south part of Shanghai.

1009
01:18:48.752 --> 01:18:50.584
<v ->Okay, I just wanna know where it is.</v>

1010
01:18:50.584 --> 01:18:52.084
Someone I know lives there.

1011
01:18:58.746 --> 01:19:02.413
<v ->Here miss, the route is only by bus or car.</v>

1012
01:19:02.413 --> 01:19:03.865
Then you travel by train

1013
01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:05.785
and then depending on time or date,

1014
01:19:05.785 --> 01:19:08.033
there's a bus to the area you're seeking.

1015
01:19:09.362 --> 01:19:10.756
<v ->Which bus goes to the train?</v>

1016
01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:18.150
<v ->The bus is just outside Shanghai.</v>

1017
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:20.370
It's marked Three station,

1018
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:22.822
and arrives at Ming terminal.

1019
01:19:22.822 --> 01:19:25.325
All trains pass through Ming terminal.

1020
01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:28.443
<v ->Can I take this?</v>

1021
01:19:28.443 --> 01:19:29.431
<v ->Yes miss.</v>

1022
01:19:30.934 --> 01:19:31.786
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1023
01:19:31.786 --> 01:19:32.908
<v ->Thank you miss.</v>

1024
01:20:13.855 --> 01:20:17.478
(suspenseful music)

1025
01:21:16.157 --> 01:21:17.815
(foreign language)

1026
01:21:18.909 --> 01:21:20.680
<v ->English? You know English?</v>

1027
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.561
<v ->Yeah, tickets please.</v>

1028
01:21:33.258 --> 01:21:34.263
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1029
01:21:34.263 --> 01:21:35.463
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1030
01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:47.784
(train brakes squeaking)

1031
01:24:06.103 --> 01:24:09.489
(chatter)

1032
01:24:40.907 --> 01:24:41.752
<v ->Hey listen,</v>

1033
01:24:41.752 --> 01:24:44.120
why don't you guys go on ahead to the Cultural Center.

1034
01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.150

Yeah, yeah we'll find her.

01:24:57.825 --> 01:24:59.335
<v ->Hey Linda.</v>

1041
01:24:59.335 --> 01:25:02.496
Why don't you talk to the desk clerk over there?

1042
01:25:03.658 --> 01:25:05.082
<v ->The desk gal?</v>

1043
01:25:05.082 --> 01:25:06.318
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1044
01:25:06.318 --> 01:25:07.534
<v ->The desk clerk?</v>

1045
01:25:07.534 --> 01:25:08.602
<v ->Desk clerk.</v>

1046
01:25:08.602 --> 01:25:10.274

<v ->Yeah, I have lot of good ideas.</v>

1048
01:25:13.383 --> 01:25:15.573

1049
01:25:15.573 --> 01:25:16.919
<v ->No I got it the first time.</v>

1050
01:25:17.889 --> 01:25:18.302
<v ->Let's go.</v>

1051
01:25:18.302 --> 01:25:20.302
(bell dinging rapidly)

1052
01:25:22.107 --> 01:25:23.579
<v ->Can I help you miss?</v>

1053
01:25:23.579 --> 01:25:27.079
<v ->Yes, did you send that little girl off by herself?</v>

1054
01:25:27.079 --> 01:25:29.019
<v ->I only showed her information, miss.</v>

1055
01:25:29.019 --> 01:25:31.111
And she went back upstairs after--

1056
01:25:31.111 --> 01:25:31.941
(mumbles)

1057
01:25:33.331 --> 01:25:34.624
<v ->Boy I sure hope so.</v>

1058
01:25:34.624 --> 01:25:37.498
(somber music)

1059
01:25:45.888 --> 01:25:47.014
<v ->Who are you?</v>

1060
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.372
I saw you today outside the station.

1061
01:25:54.372 --> 01:25:56.065
Why are you watching my daughter?

1062
01:26:00.743 --> 01:26:02.617
<v ->Were you in a bus accident?</v>

1063
01:26:04.262 --> 01:26:05.755
<v ->How do you know this?</v>

1064
01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:17.997
Why are you here?

1065
01:26:20.533 --> 01:26:21.707
<v ->I don't know.</v>

1066
01:26:27.123 --> 01:26:30.577
<v ->I look back on the decisions I've made,</v>

1067
01:26:30.577 --> 01:26:32.989
and how different my life would be.

1068
01:26:34.979 --> 01:26:37.907
Hard decisions affect the people you love the most.

1069
01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.366
<v ->I still don't see why she wouldn't want to come.</v>

1070
01:26:52.326 --> 01:26:54.309
My roommate's the one who bandaged your arm.

1071
01:26:56.319 --> 01:26:57.476
<v ->Really?</v>

1072
01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.582
<v ->Hello?</v>

1073
01:27:07.744 --> 01:27:09.062
(knocking)

1074
01:27:11.904 --> 01:27:13.222
(knocking)

1075
01:27:14.508 --> 01:27:17.011
Lin, I know you're in there.

1076
01:27:17.011 --> 01:27:18.022
(foreign language)

1077
01:27:21.121 --> 01:27:23.863
Lin, I know you speak English.

1078
01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:26.123
Please Lin, I've come a long way.

1079
01:27:26.123 --> 01:27:27.493
I just want to meet you.

1080
01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:43.937
<v ->What do you want here?</v>

1081
01:27:45.439 --> 01:27:47.915
My father is not home, please leave me alone.

1082
01:27:49.758 --> 01:27:52.496
<v ->Your father has told me so much about you.</v>

1083
01:27:53.579 --> 01:27:55.213
<v ->You talked to my father?</v>

1084
01:27:55.213 --> 01:27:58.554
<v ->Yeah, we had tea together just a few minutes ago.</v>

1085
01:27:58.554 --> 01:28:01.398
He wanted me to talk to you alone.

1086
01:28:01.398 --> 01:28:05.266
<v ->Are you from the medical mission in Shanghai?</v>

1087
01:28:05.266 --> 01:28:06.000
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1088
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.987
<v ->Are you a doctor?</v>

1089
01:28:07.987 --> 01:28:10.816
<v ->No Lin, I'm a high school student from California.</v>

1090
01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:15.652
<v ->I'll make you some tea then.</v>

1091
01:28:17.972 --> 01:28:20.757
<v ->We don't know exactly, Mrs. Nelson,</v>

1092
01:28:20.757 --> 01:28:23.009
all we know is she requested directions

1093
01:28:23.009 --> 01:28:24.371
to a different town.

1094
01:28:24.371 --> 01:28:26.443
<v Mrs. Nelson>Alright, then someone has to find her.</v>

1095
01:28:26.443 --> 01:28:29.743
How do you let a 17 year old girl strike out on her own?

1096
01:28:29.743 --> 01:28:32.027
<v ->I know, I know, don't worry, we'll find her.</v>

1097
01:28:32.027 --> 01:28:33.597
Listen, do you have...

1098
01:28:34.523 --> 01:28:37.113
Do you have any idea why she would have taken--

1099
01:28:37.113 --> 01:28:38.303
This means wait.

1100
01:28:39.461 --> 01:28:40.585
Do you have any idea why she would have taken

1101
01:28:40.585 --> 01:28:43.149
a particular interest in this girl?

1102
01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:45.267
<v ->They were born on the same day.</v>

1103
01:28:46.509 --> 01:28:47.391
<v ->Really?</v>

1104
01:28:49.434 --> 01:28:50.703
<v ->Tell her you'll call back.</v>

1105
01:28:50.703 --> 01:28:52.431
<v ->One second, what?</v>

1106
01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:55.403
<v ->Tell her you'll call her back.</v>

1107
01:28:56.469 --> 01:28:59.265
<v ->Mrs. Nelson, uh, can I call you right back?</v>

1108
01:28:59.265 --> 01:28:59.797
<v Mrs. Nelson>Please.</v>

1109
01:28:59.797 --> 01:29:00.589
<v ->Yes I promise.</v>

1110
01:29:00.589 --> 01:29:01.613
<v Mrs. Nelson>Call me back, please.</v>

1111
01:29:01.613 --> 01:29:04.001
<v ->Okay we'll call you back. Okay bye.</v>

1112
01:29:04.001 --> 01:29:05.733
What do you have, what is it?

1113
01:29:05.733 --> 01:29:07.016
What what what?

1114
01:29:10.926 --> 01:29:11.979
I see that!

1115
01:29:12.965 --> 01:29:14.043
What are you looking for?

1116
01:29:14.043 --> 01:29:15.754
<v ->Yeah, what are you looking for?</v>

1117
01:29:17.296 --> 01:29:18.485
(laughs)

1118
01:29:18.485 --> 01:29:20.442
<v ->This girl fascinated Katie.</v>

1119
01:29:21.452 --> 01:29:23.458
I could never understand.

1120
01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.977
She went to go find her.

1121
01:29:26.308 --> 01:29:27.401
Look, here it is.

1122
01:29:33.639 --> 01:29:35.529
<v ->When I first decided to get involved with Doctor's Gift,</v>

1123
01:29:35.529 --> 01:29:37.505
I didn't know what to expect.

1124
01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.653
I guess I was just trying to figure out

1125
01:29:38.653 --> 01:29:40.686
what life is like in the real world.

1126
01:29:41.952 --> 01:29:45.140
Of course my boyfriend thought I was nuts.

1127
01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.373
<v ->You have a boyfriend?</v>

1128
01:29:47.876 --> 01:29:50.704
<v ->Yeah, we been together about two years.</v>

1129
01:29:50.704 --> 01:29:53.588
<v ->What's it like to be together?</v>

1130
01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:54.398
<v ->What do you mean?</v>

1131
01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:56.938
<v ->To have a boyfriend?</v>

1132
01:29:58.736 --> 01:30:01.884
<v ->It's okay. Sometimes it's hard.</v>

1133
01:30:01.884 --> 01:30:03.130
Everyone thinks that when you have a boyfriend

1134
01:30:03.130 --> 01:30:04.684
it's all good but it's not.

1135
01:30:08.722 --> 01:30:10.812
Your father told me you like to read a lot.

1136
01:30:10.812 --> 01:30:13.692
<v ->I like to read. I like to read about America.</v>

1137
01:30:13.692 --> 01:30:14.844
I saw a movie once.

1138
01:30:14.844 --> 01:30:15.612
<v ->What movie?</v>

1139
01:30:15.612 --> 01:30:17.014
<v ->A Roy Rogers movie.</v>

1140
01:30:18.472 --> 01:30:20.309
<v ->I don't think I've seen that one.</v>

1141
01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:26.825
Can I tell you something?

1142
01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:29.478
<v ->I like to listen to you talk.</v>

1143
01:30:30.976 --> 01:30:33.082
<v ->Listen when I first saw your picture--</v>

1144
01:30:36.032 --> 01:30:36.720
Lin!

1145
01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:42.227
Lin did I say something wrong?

1146
01:30:42.227 --> 01:30:43.728
Did I say something?

1147
01:30:43.728 --> 01:30:45.072
<v ->Please leave.</v>

1148
01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:47.058
<v ->I will, let me finish.</v>

1149
01:30:48.856 --> 01:30:50.584
When I first saw your picture,

1150
01:30:50.584 --> 01:30:53.164
and then I saw we had the same birthday,

1151
01:30:53.164 --> 01:30:55.236
I thought for the first time that maybe there was more

1152
01:30:55.236 --> 01:30:57.900
to life than boyfriends or shopping,

1153
01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.549
or lying in the sun on the beach.

1154
01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:06.605
And then yesterday when those kids came in for surgery,

1155
01:31:06.605 --> 01:31:07.931
I fell apart.

1156
01:31:09.365 --> 01:31:12.309
I completely fell apart because it's different

1157
01:31:12.309 --> 01:31:14.933
when you look at a photograph of someone,

1158
01:31:14.933 --> 01:31:16.867
and then you see them for real.

1159
01:31:19.605 --> 01:31:21.474
I wanted to know that I could care.

1160
01:31:24.296 --> 01:31:26.524
<v ->I've never felt the sun on my face.</v>

1161
01:31:27.674 --> 01:31:28.854
<v ->Let's go find it then.</v>

1162
01:31:35.291 --> 01:31:36.125
Sha Lin.

1163
01:31:46.947 --> 01:31:47.763
Please?

1164
01:31:49.433 --> 01:31:50.859
Let's go to Shanghai.

1165
01:31:58.097 --> 01:31:59.110
<v ->Where is he?</v>

1166
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.958
<v ->I don't know.</v>

1167
01:32:08.944 --> 01:32:09.980
<v ->Where is he?</v>

1168
01:32:11.947 --> 01:32:13.429
<v ->Get on, I'll go find him.</v>

1169
01:32:13.429 --> 01:32:14.901
<v ->Oh no no, we're both getting on.</v>

1170
01:32:14.901 --> 01:32:16.908
I can't handle another irate parent.

1171
01:32:18.568 --> 01:32:19.006
<v ->Okay.</v>

1172
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:28.879
<v ->Just like a old cowboy movie!</v>

1173
01:32:30.827 --> 01:32:31.919
<v ->Have some more.</v>

1174
01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:36.745
Eat, please.

1175
01:32:42.983 --> 01:32:44.881
<v ->Do you think she'd let me see her face?</v>

1176
01:32:46.551 --> 01:32:48.199
<v ->Sometimes.</v>

1177
01:32:48.199 --> 01:32:50.882
When we're reading she takes it off.

1178
01:32:52.213 --> 01:32:53.830
She changes so much.

1179
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.746
She's very different.

1180
01:32:58.008 --> 01:32:59.930
<v ->What are you talking about?</v>

1181
01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:00.754
<v ->You.</v>

1182
01:33:02.797 --> 01:33:04.132
<v ->What about me?</v>

1183
01:33:04.132 --> 01:33:06.508
<v ->You're father's watching his little girl grow up.</v>

1184
01:33:07.548 --> 01:33:09.342
<v ->What do you mean?</v>

1185
01:33:09.342 --> 01:33:11.193
<v ->We're teenagers.</v>

1186
01:33:11.193 --> 01:33:12.069
<v ->Teenagers?</v>

1187
01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:16.456
Yeah, I can see it.

1188
01:33:36.846 --> 01:33:38.958
You can sleep here, there's room.

1189
01:33:38.958 --> 01:33:40.326
<v ->Oh, I can just sleep--</v>

1190
01:33:40.326 --> 01:33:41.460
<v ->No no no.</v>

1191
01:33:42.574 --> 01:33:45.236
You'll have much better sleep without hearing...

1192
01:33:47.182 --> 01:33:49.318
(foreign language)

1193
01:33:49.318 --> 01:33:50.014
<v ->Snoring.</v>

1194
01:33:50.014 --> 01:33:51.122
(laughter)

1195
01:33:51.122 --> 01:33:52.347
<v ->My snoring.</v>

1196
01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:00.360
(somber music)

1197
01:34:04.365 --> 01:34:05.834
<v ->Are you okay Katie?</v>

1198
01:34:08.099 --> 01:34:11.192
<v ->Well, no one knows where I am.</v>

1199
01:34:11.192 --> 01:34:12.697
I left the hotel without telling anyone

1200
01:34:12.697 --> 01:34:14.027
where I was going.

1201
01:34:16.179 --> 01:34:18.227
<v ->I've been dreaming of foreign land.</v>

1202
01:34:19.873 --> 01:34:20.776
<v ->Really.</v>

1203
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:26.589
<v ->Is he handsome?</v>

1204
01:34:29.387 --> 01:34:30.184
<v ->Who?</v>

1205
01:34:31.426 --> 01:34:34.249
<v ->Your boyfriend, is he handsome?</v>

1206
01:34:35.959 --> 01:34:37.332
<v ->Maybe a little.</v>

1207
01:34:40.366 --> 01:34:42.064
<v ->Does he have a white hat?</v>

1208
01:34:44.482 --> 01:34:46.948
<v ->I don't know if he has a white hat.</v>

1209
01:34:52.034 --> 01:34:53.514
<v ->Goodnight girls.</v>

1210
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.338
<v ->Goodnight father.</v>

1211
01:34:57.816 --> 01:34:58.770
<v ->Goodnight.</v>

1212
01:35:41.625 --> 01:35:43.466
Little lost, teddy bear?

1213
01:35:46.056 --> 01:35:47.227
<v ->Katie!</v>

1214
01:35:47.227 --> 01:35:49.741
Oh my gosh! Are you crazy?

1215
01:35:49.741 --> 01:35:51.162
Are you okay?

1216
01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:52.354
Oh my gosh.

1217
01:35:52.354 --> 01:35:54.088
<v ->I'm sorry Linda.</v>

1218
01:35:54.088 --> 01:35:55.278
<v ->How's your hand?</v>

1219
01:35:55.278 --> 01:35:57.665
<v ->It's fine now, thank you.</v>

1220
01:35:57.665 --> 01:35:59.457
It's great to see you again.

1221
01:35:59.457 --> 01:36:00.362
<v ->Yeah!</v>

1222
01:36:12.653 --> 01:36:14.844
<v ->You were wrong, he's very handsome.</v>

1223
01:36:21.462 --> 01:36:22.221
<v ->Hey Ted.</v>

1224
01:36:23.635 --> 01:36:24.734
You have a white hat?

1225
01:36:28.728 --> 01:36:31.494
(laughs)

1226
01:36:39.074 --> 01:36:41.973
(calm music)

1227
01:36:51.466 --> 01:36:52.318
We're in.

1228
01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.896
<v ->Okay campers, you can celebrate later, we're off to prep.</v>

1229
01:36:59.896 --> 01:37:01.219
Now I hope you're not too squeamish

1230
01:37:01.219 --> 01:37:02.968
or have some rare blood type or anything.

1231
01:37:02.968 --> 01:37:04.446
<v ->If you need blood I can help.</v>

1232
01:37:05.548 --> 01:37:06.223
<v ->Me too.</v>

1233
01:37:06.223 --> 01:37:08.905
<v ->Okay come on bring the love this way, come on.</v>

1234
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:20.971
(whimpers)

1235
01:38:06.893 --> 01:38:08.081
<v ->She wants you.</v>

1236
01:38:14.568 --> 01:38:17.313
<v ->Lin, you really need to get back into bed.</v>

1237
01:38:24.423 --> 01:38:25.564
You scared?

1238
01:38:27.021 --> 01:38:28.118
<v ->A little.</v>

1239
01:38:30.556 --> 01:38:31.647
<v ->I'm scared too.</v>

("Narrow Daylight" by Diana Krall)

1241
01:38:42.635 --> 01:38:44.557
♫ Narrow daylight

1242
01:38:47.507 --> 01:38:49.977
♫ Under my room

1243
01:38:51.454 --> 01:38:55.608
♫ Shining hours were brief

1244
01:38:57.171 --> 01:39:01.604
♫ Winter is over, summer is near

1245
01:39:01.604 --> 01:39:06.604
♫ Are we stronger than we believe? ♫

1246
01:39:11.396 --> 01:39:13.866
<v ->Blood pressure is stable, pulse is stable</v>

1247
01:39:15.428 --> 01:39:17.854
<v ->She'll be out in about 20 seconds.</v>

1248
01:39:22.244 --> 01:39:26.934
♫ As the camera clings to the common thread

1249
01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.852
♫ Beyond all vanity

1250
01:39:30.852 --> 01:39:35.141
♫ Into a gaze to shoot you through

1251
01:39:37.599 --> 01:39:40.592
♫ Is the kindness we count on

1252
01:39:43.241 --> 01:39:46.327
♫ Hidden in everyone?

1253
01:39:50.325 --> 01:39:54.633 line:15% 
♫ I stepped out in a sunlit grove

1254
01:39:54.633 --> 01:39:59.254 line:15% 
♫ Although deep down I wished it would rain

1255
01:40:01.244 --> 01:40:06.244 line:15% 
♫ Washing away all the sadness and tears

1256
01:40:06.407 --> 01:40:11.093 line:15% 
♫ That will never fall so heavily again ♫

1257
01:40:26.139 --> 01:40:27.193
<v ->Oh no you don't.</v>

1258
01:40:28.183 --> 01:40:29.947
Come here, I want to show you something.

1259
01:40:43.198 --> 01:40:46.328
♫ Is the kindness we count on

1260
01:40:48.958 --> 01:40:52.792
♫ Hidden in everyone?

1261
01:40:55.742 --> 01:41:00.114
♫ I stood there in the salt spray air

1262
01:41:00.114 --> 01:41:04.760
♫ Felt the wind sweeping over my face

1263
01:41:06.598 --> 01:41:08.370
♫ I ran up through the rocks

1264
01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:11.890
♫ To the old wooden cross

1265
01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:16.255
♫ It's a place where I can find some peace

1266
01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:24.718
♫ Narrow daylight

1267
01:41:27.135 --> 01:41:30.064
♫ Entered in my room

1268
01:41:31.305 --> 01:41:34.907
♫ Shining hours were brief

1269
01:41:37.025 --> 01:41:41.599
♫ Winter is over, summer is near

1270
01:41:41.599 --> 01:41:46.599
♫ Are we stronger than we believe ♫

1271
01:41:58.095 --> 01:42:02.033
(soothing music)
