going about 55 miles an
hour hit me from behind

But this was me.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I decided to check
out of the hospital.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this one
thought, and the thought

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
was, the power that made
the body heals the body.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't stop thinking
about that because I

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
knew that there's an
intelligence that's

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
giving us life that
keeps our heart beating

and digesting our food.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that I was
going to make contact

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
with this intelligence,
and I was going to give it

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
a plan, a template, a design.

I was going to surrender this
creation to a greater mind

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.223 align:middle line:84%
because it knows how to
heal way better than I do.

00:06:36.223 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%

I said was, I'm not

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
going to let any thought
slip by my awareness

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:90%
that I don't want to experience.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%

mind, reconstructing my spine

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%

So for six weeks, I went through
this incredible dark night

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
of the soul because I
couldn't really get my mind

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:90%
to do what I wanted it to do.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And it would take me about
three hours and closing my eyes

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and reconstructing
every single vertebrae

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and starting over again every
time I lost my attention.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
At the end of six weeks, I
went through the whole entire

process without
losing my attention,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:84%

in that moment.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I clicked.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing significant
changes in my body.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
My motor functions

change dramatically.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was back on

again at 12 weeks.

deal with myself.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And the deal was that if I
was ever able to walk again,

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
understood and used

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
with great success
in healing our bodies

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
before modern medicine
ever came along.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think those
are interesting.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
What really fascinates me
is the inner environment.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the environment
that the Buddha talked to us

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:90%
about so eloquently.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha said that
every man and woman

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
is the architect of their own
healing and their own destiny.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a natural
intelligence that leads those

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:10%
cells from the
embryo to the baby.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:10%
There is a natural intelligence
that leads the acorn

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:10%
into an oak tree.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural
intelligence that

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
keeps the planets
revolving around the sun.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
We would not have
been able to evolve

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
without having a mechanism
which allows us to take a hit.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's what disease is.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what injury is.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You took a hit.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But the immune system is
the way the body corrects.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And that intelligence
that's giving us life,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:84%
that's keeping our heart beating
and digesting our food that

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
runs through the
autonomic nervous system,

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
it is the greatest
healer in the world.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
get out of the way.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I was always super healthy.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:84%
My life was really just a
journey of healing and health.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I was studying
acupuncture, yoga.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I was a super good eater, mostly
vegetarian, probably 40% raw.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But I had gone through
a lot of stress.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:10%
I moved.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:10%
I was in a very bad marriage.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:10%
My mom died.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.918 align:middle line:84%
That was probably
the hardest part.

00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And she died of cancer.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much the whole
foundation was shaken,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but I have always had
this real positive,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
so I just kept doing
yoga and riding my bike,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.235 align:middle line:84%
and I thought
everything was fine.

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But I did know that
there was something

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
wrong with me
physically because I

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:84%
would get headaches and just
kind of feel a little nauseous.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a
doctor three times

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:90%
over the course of a year.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.522 align:middle line:84%
And each time, he gave
me a different test.

00:10:32.522 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, you're fine.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So the third time, I told
him, I have a lot of pain,

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and there's like a
stabbing pain in this area.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it was bottom of my colon
at the junction of the rectum.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So he did a sigmoidoscopy,
and there it was.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was stage
two or three at first.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.373 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the first thing they do

00:10:54.373 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
is they send you to a PET scan.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the PET scan showed
that it was in a few places,

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and it was in my liver, also.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was stage four,
and that was a shocker.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard of anyone
living from stage four.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth's story really
shocked me because she reminds

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:90%
me a lot of myself.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:10%
She was healthy, worked
out, did yoga, seemingly

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:10%
did everything right.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Yet, one day, she wakes
up with stage four cancer.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It makes me question, are we at
the mercy of some random fate?

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
else going on that we just

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:90%
might not be aware of?

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.407 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been in practice
for 35 years now,

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen a lot of patients.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I've seen a lot of crazy things.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:10%
And I'm more firmly
convinced every week

00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:10%
that goes by that the ultimate
cause of disease is stress.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:10%
>> 90% of what takes people to
the doctor is stress-related

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:10%
illnesses.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:10%
They leave with
anti-depressants.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.852 align:middle line:84%
They leave with every
kind of medication.

00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:14.657 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> We have three basic stresses.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
We have physical stress, like
accidents, injuries, falls,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
traumas.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
We have chemical
stress, like bacteria

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and viruses and
hormones in foods

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and heavy metals and hangovers
and blood sugar levels.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
emotional stress,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's family tragedies,
loss, job, finances.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things
knock our brain and body out

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:10%
>> When you perceive a threat,
in the old days in school,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle line:10%
we referred to that as
activating the adrenal system,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:10%
fight or flight.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're being chased
by a saber tooth tiger,

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
how much energy do you want
to make available to run away

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.052 align:middle line:90%
from that tiger?

00:12:55.052 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I hope you get the
answer, and the answer

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
is I want 100% of the energy
to run away from the tiger.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Centuries,
thousands of years ago,

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:10%
that was maybe appropriate
because there was literally

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:10%
a potentially life-threatening
situation with a wild animal,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:10%
let's say.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But now it's your spouse or it's
your boss or it's rent that's

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:90%
due in a week.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet the system
reacts in the same way

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:84%
as though it's a
life-threatening situation,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.383 align:middle line:84%
so you're still
releasing cortisol.

00:13:25.383 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
You're still
releasing adrenaline,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.148 align:middle line:90%
noradrenaline into the system.

00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you're running a
flight or fight response all

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
the time, by definition, you
are mobilizing resources from

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
your gut, from your
elimination system,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.427 align:middle line:84%
from your immune system, from
your higher brain centers,

00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and putting that energy
into your muscles to fight

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:90%
for your life.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
That means your memory
is not all that good.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Your concentration is down.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't digest
your food properly.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
You can't eliminate
toxins properly.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And your immune system is
compromised, chronically,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Stress hormones
inhibit the immune system.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
How effective?

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.418 align:middle line:84%
When doctors want to transplant
an organ from person A

00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to person, B, they
want to transplant

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
a heart or a kidney
or a lung, the doctor

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
gives the patient the
stress hormones and then

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:90%
transplants the organ.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:10%
Once the organ is put
in, the foreign organ

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:10%
and the immune system is now
shut down by stress hormones,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:10%
then I'm not rejecting
the foreign organ.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately in today's world,
the stresses are 24/7, 365.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:10%
They never let up.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Good evening.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Just ahead of the spring
and summer travel season,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.538 align:middle line:10%
we got a sobering
update on Zika today.

00:14:38.538 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, New York City!

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The net result is
illness and disease.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:10%
That is the only
consequence that

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:10%
will come from the
chemistry of fear.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.146 align:middle line:10%
And yet, look at
the world today.

00:14:52.146 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:10%
>> ISIS's so-called
caliphate is under attack.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The Dow plunged
another 260 points.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
New losses for Americans
and the 401(k)'s.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning, I just
thought maybe it was some kind

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of, like, reaction or a hive
or some dermatological thing.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Then it started to progress
and get worse and worse.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get massive
breakouts and boils and hives.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
to spread a little bit

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
to my ears and my head.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started to
freak out more and thought,

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's probably
something more serious

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
than I'm just guessing it
to be by putting on some,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:90%
like, topical creams and stuff.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think what really sparked
it was maybe about a year

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and a half ago, it was
the middle of the night,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and I woke up, but
I couldn't move.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
My right side of my
body was paralyzed.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
So I freaked out for a moment.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.478 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was having a stroke
or something was happening.

00:15:51.478 --> 00:15:54.103 align:middle line:84%
And eventually I could start to
feel some tingling coming back,

00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and then I rolled out of bed.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.663 align:middle line:84%
From that moment, I
think, about a year

00:15:57.663 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and a half ago, is
when I really started

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:84%
to-- went to the rheumatologist,
went to a neurologist,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
allergist.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They keep saying,
oh, it's autoimmune.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, the biopsies now show
connective tissue disorder,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
so we know it's
something autoimmune.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're giving
me all this literature

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:90%
and all these different drugs.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, they
sound so scary.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to take them.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, causes blindness
and then heart disease

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and just tons and
tons of side effects.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's so refreshing that
no one knows how to help you,

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.115 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and, you know,
sometimes I'm thankful

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.555 align:middle line:90%
it's nothing worse.

00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, for me, you

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
know, just daily life,
it's, like, I have to work.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I have the kids, you know?

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I've got other responsibilities.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And just-- then I have to go
to the doctor, like, five times

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
a week, and it starts
to get really daunting.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:90%
It's really tiring.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so tired.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Jesus, take care of Mommy.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I hope her dots goes away.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And now I put the
holy water on her.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.092 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:16:56.092 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>> My little one, she
goes to a private school,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and she always prays.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
She goes, "Mommy, I prayed for
your dots today to go away."

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I was telling her, oh,
somebody from Mommy's work--

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:90%
remember Kelly?

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.283 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, she's
going to help Mommy.

00:17:07.283 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
She goes, see, God's
going to help Mommy.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>> It was so cute.

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I started crying.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was
like, oh yeah, see,

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
it's just things are meant
to be sometimes, right?

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Things will come-- yeah, come
into your life for some reason.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.008 align:middle line:90%
Like, who would have thought?

00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's so crazy how
the universe works.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Eva brought me some contracts
to sign at the office

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and apologized for a rash
that was on her hand.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Only then did I find
out that for three years

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
she's been struggling
with this mystery illness.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to connect her
with some holistic practitioners

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked with,
see if they can come up

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
with an answer for
her and help her,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and we'll just see what works,
what doesn't, and hopefully

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:90%
find out why.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we are now about
three centuries in to a mindset

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
in medicine that was predicated
on the work of Descartes

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and even Newton
and Darwin, even,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
this idea that our
symptoms are meaningless,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that our body is a machine,
it's full of organs with buttons

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and levers that need adjusting,
and that you're really not here

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:90%
for any purposeful existence.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You're here to live and
survive until you die.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Medicine being derived
from Newtonian physics looked

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
at the body as a physical device
and that if there's anything

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
wrong with it it is a
consequence of a problem

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
in the mechanics of
a physical machine.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, this is
really cool until 1925.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
In 1925, a new physics
came in, quantum physics.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the relevance
in quantum physics?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, it said that
invisible energy around that

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
was out there that we
did not count and even

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
talk about in medicine because
it's just a physical body,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
it turns out our
perception of what

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:90%
is physical is an illusion.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing physical at all.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look inside any
part of your body with

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.517 align:middle line:10%
a microscope-- so
let's say, your hand--

00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:10%
and you look inside your
hand, you find cells.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:10%
You look inside the
cells, you get your DNA

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:10%
in the center of the cell.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.615 align:middle line:84%
You look inside the
DNA, you find atoms.

00:19:20.615 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:84%
You look inside the atoms,
there's nothing there.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.415 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's protons,
neutrons, electrons.

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing
is inside an atom

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
there's 99.9999999999999%
empty space.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
If a proton was an apple,
the size of an apple,

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the closest electron would be
the size of a grain of salt,

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and it would be approximately
2 kilometers away.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's how much space you
would get, simple pi r squared.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The particles
themselves, they actually

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
emerge essentially out of
what's called the quantum field.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, you can think
of particles as just waves

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
of energy, just literally
vibrations of energy.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it shifts your mind
from thinking that something

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is seemingly solid and permanent
to perhaps something can change

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:90%
and something can be healed.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Long, long time ago,
the word "spirit" was what?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Invisible moving forces that
influence the physical realm.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:10%
Quantum physics
is taking us back

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:10%
to a time that said the
invisible forces that we have

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:10%
been discounting in
medicine turned out

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:10%
to be the primary forces
that control everything.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well,
what do they include?

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:10%
Mind, consciousness.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, if
you want to come back

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
to the supreme power
over our biology,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
it's thought the invisible
energy from our mind that

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:84%
not only shapes our body
but shapes our relationship

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:90%
to the world in which we live.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> February the 2nd, 2006,
should have been the last day

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:10%
I had lymphoma, which had
started four years prior

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:10%
with just a lump on my neck.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I had tumors, some of
them the size of lemons,

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
from the base of my skull, all
around my neck, under my arms,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:84%
into my chest, and all the
way down to my abdomen.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I was so weak that my organs
started shutting down one

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:84%
by one, and I went into a coma,
and the doctors told my family

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that these were my final hours.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I then went into a realm
where I became aware

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of my deceased father.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing
up, my father and I

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
had a very turbulent
relationship.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I was always left with this
feeling that I had let him down

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and that I had never
been the kind of daughter

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:90%
he wanted me to be.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And here I was now with
him in the other realm,

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and all I felt from
him and for him

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:90%
was pure unconditional love.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
There was no judgment from
him at all for anything

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
that I had done.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It was like I reached a state
of complete and total clarity.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that state of
clarity, I understood

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:90%
why I had the cancer.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I understood how it was that
every decision and every choice

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I had made in my life up to
that point was made from fear.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:10%
Now that I knew this
truth, I realized

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:10%
that if I chose to go back
to my body that I would heal.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was in those
moments that I felt myself

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the coma.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
By about a week, the
doctors could actually

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
see that the tumors
were dissolving

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.250 align:middle line:84%
faster than they'd ever
seen tumors dissolve before.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
At the end of five weeks,
I was physically stronger,

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and they really could find no
trace of cancer in my body,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
so they let me go home and
live my life cancer free.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita's story is the most
powerful example of just what

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:90%
is possible with the human body.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:10%
She is proof that no matter
how far gone the body seems,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:10%
it is possible for tissues
to regenerate and function

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:10%
to restore.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:84%
She had a dramatic
shift in the way

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
she looked at life from
one of fear to one of love.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And her body
responded and healed.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:84%
But is she just some
random miracle or can

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
we study what happened
so that more people can

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:90%
make this shift?

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.198 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.198 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:10%
>> So I've been studying radical
remissions for over 10 years

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:10%
now, and it started with a trip
around the world to interview

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:10%
radical remission survivors
from all different countries.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, since
then, I've gone on

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to analyze over
1,500 of these cases,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and I've conducted over
250 in-depth interviews.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And these are people
from all walks of life.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
radical remissions

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
verified and reported for
every single cancer type--

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:84%
people with pancreatic cancer,
with stage four lung cancer,

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
with a big brain tumor
that's considered inoperable.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:84%
There are examples of people out
there who have healed from it.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered over
75 different things

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
that these people have
done to try to get well,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:84%
but not everybody uses
all 75 of these factors.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
However, when I
looked at the data,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:90%
they were all using these nine.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Only two of them are physical.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
The rest are mental,
emotional, and spiritual.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that hit me like
a ton of bricks.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
There really is a way to
activate the immune system

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:90%
with your mental-emotional work.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:10%
And of course, there's plenty
of science behind that.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Does that mean that we're
all going to heal tomorrow?

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
No, but it means they
deserve to be studied,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's something incredible
there for us to learn.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I very much believed that
perfect health was only one

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:90%
prescription away.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.290 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't until
about nine months

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:49.450 align:middle line:10%
postpartum my pregnancy that
I got my first diagnosis.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was diagnosed with
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I had symptoms of brain fog,
forgetfulness, intense fatigue,

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:90%
and very much was not myself.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I was a new mom,
so it's easy to sort of dismiss

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:90%
those symptoms.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had that
same feeling again,

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
like, I don't want
to take a medication

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a way out, right?

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
another option.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to a naturopath,
which was very unlike me.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd only ever been trained to
dismiss alternative medicine

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
as sort of this
nuisance, like a nuisance

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.117 align:middle line:84%
to legitimate real
medicine, right?

00:26:28.117 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I went there because I knew
that conventional medicine had

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:84%
nothing to offer me,
and I knew that there

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
was no way I would ever get
out of having a chronic illness

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
if I proceeded with my
conventional doctor.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I
put into remission

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
in six months what should be
a chronic lifelong disease.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced the raising
of a lot of red flags,

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
essentially, where
I said, you know,

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I never learned that nutrition
has anything to do with health.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, open your little mouth.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:10%
>> We have a sick care system
where doctors and insurance

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:10%
companies are basically treating
symptoms but aren't really

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:10%
getting to root causes, in
many cases aren't dealing with

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:10%
the whole person.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:10%
They're dealing with a
symptom, by which they then

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.520 align:middle line:10%
give a drug, which
then has a side effect.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And so it keeps on spinning--

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:84%
more toxicity, more toxicity,
more disease, more ill health.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Conventional medicine, tied
up in an old belief system,

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:84%
is locked into the
cause of illness is tied

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:84%
into our genetics
and our biochemistry.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
pharmaceutical industry

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
is the great savior.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it will
make the chemistry

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that should bring us
back to health again.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that's totally false.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
There are so few diseases
that are actually organic.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 100% of
diabetes type 2 has

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with
genetics and everything

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:90%
to do with lifestyle.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
90% or more of
cardiovascular disease

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
has nothing organically
wrong with the individual.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just the consequence
of dealing with stress.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh dear, what am I gonna do?

00:28:11.582 --> 00:28:12.382 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:28:12.382 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Professor--

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Does this mean
medicine is all negative?

00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And I go, absolutely not.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Medicine does
miracles with trauma.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.690 align:middle line:84%
If I physically hurt myself,
I get in a car accident

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and my guts are hanging
out, don't send me

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:90%
to a chiropractor.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need a
massage therapist.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And homeopathy is really
not going to help.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:90%
I want a surgeon.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Medicine is useful.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Pharmaceutical medicine,
therapeutic interventions,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:10%
surgery, et cetera are useful.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say, maybe
10% acute illnesses.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if you have
a chronic illness--

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what it
is, cancer, heart disease,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:90%
autoimmune illnesses--

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.390 align:middle line:84%
use a holistic approach,
which means everything

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:84%
from mind, body, emotions,
energy healing, even

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%
distant healing, anything that
influences your experience

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.315 align:middle line:90%
of mind, body, emotions.

00:29:08.315 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So with emergencies and
acute illness like injury

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
or infection, we
need a quick fix.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So thank God we have the most
advanced lifesaving technology.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But with chronic
illnesses, they've

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.592 align:middle line:84%
developed over time, so the
quick fix model won't work.

00:29:27.592 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to get to the
root cause if we're

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:90%
going to make a change.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to speak to a guy who
is helping thousands of people

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:90%
get to that root cause.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
He uses, well, a different
kind of diagnostic technology.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me do a little of this.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.334 align:middle line:90%
Just hang on.

00:29:44.334 --> 00:29:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Um, we thought you had
a heart murmur before,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:90%
but it looks good.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:90%
It all started at age four.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:10%
Woke up one morning to a
voice that I call Spirit,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:10%
and this voice talked to me just
like someone else is talking

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:10%
to, like, you or if you're
hearing someone talk

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:10%
or you're talking
to someone else.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's in real time.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that evening at the
dinner table with my family

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.380 align:middle line:84%
all sitting around,
Spirit appeared,

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:90%
asked me to come out of my seat.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I came out, walked
up to my grandmother.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Then Spirit took my hand,
put it on my grandma--

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and I put it on my
grandmother's chest.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And Spirit said,
pronounce "lung cancer."

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Say that grandmother
has lung cancer.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Grandma has lung cancer.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks later, they
brought her in out of curiosity

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:84%
because it just
couldn't leave us.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't forget about it.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:90%
And she had lung cancer.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.448 align:middle line:84%
Lower back's not as
good as it should be.

00:30:35.448 --> 00:30:37.323 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if you
go to a chiropractor.

00:30:37.323 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I-- like, weekly.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Weekly?

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, is he working on that?

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have a
spasm that's right there.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's from--

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> From many years.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That's from L3, L4.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I like that stuff.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.487 align:middle line:84%
This is fun because
you're really healthy.

00:30:50.487 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Breaks my heart when someone
has something serious wrong

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you convince the
skeptics out there to believe

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:90%
you?

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really not an issue.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.617 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really run
into too many skeptics,

00:31:00.617 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:90%
actually, to tell you the truth.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's plenty
of them out there.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in this where
you want to help people,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
you want to give them the
answers and people are

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:84%
suffering out there and they got
chronic illness and the answers

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
aren't out there, it's
not about the skeptics.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.133 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:16.675 align:middle line:84%
It's about the person
getting better.

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It's about the person healing.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:90%
It's about what they need.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the focus.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So I really don't
focus on the skeptics.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about these
chronic mystery illnesses.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Doctors have labeled them
autoimmune disorders.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason we call it
autoimmune is because we

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
don't know the cause of
the symptoms or the disease

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:90%
or illness that's occurring.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Look into psoriasis and eczema--

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:90%
cause unknown.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Multiple sclerosis--
cause unknown.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Fibromyalgia-- cause known.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Rheumatoid arthritis--
cause unknown.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is there's
a pathogen involved.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
There's something
causing the problem--

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
a toxin or a pathogen.
It's causing the symptoms.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The body is trying to
protect you from it.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
The key to getting
rid of it is knowing

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
how to use certain things, like
certain herbs, certain foods.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly is the foods,
to know what starves it.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Treating certain toxins and
pathogens with diet and herbs

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:10%
really resonates with me.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.970 align:middle line:10%
Turning to nature
and food as medicine

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:10%
is what ancient civilizations
have been doing successfully

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:10%
for thousands of years.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I know that when I cleaned up
my diet, the positive effect

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
on not only my physical health
but my mental health, as well,

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.368 align:middle line:90%
was huge.

00:32:38.368 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I thought a
good place for Eva to start

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:90%
was to see a nutritionist.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>> With Eva, she's got
a barrage of symptoms.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:10%
One thing in particular, as
I looked at her blood lab,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:10%
is that she is really
inflamed-- chronic inflammation.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We literally have trillions
of bacterial microbes,

00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.940 align:middle line:90%
good microbes in our body.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We actually have more
bacteria in our body

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:90%
than we do our own human cells.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of
these live in our gut.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And what the
microbiome is is it's

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:84%
like a little universe in itself
inside our gut that constantly

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is cleansing us, stimulating
immunity, building vitamins,

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and keeping pathogens
out of our system.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's
microbiome gets killed off

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:90%
for various reasons--

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:84%
mostly bad diet, stress,
medications, perhaps--

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
you can kill off enough
for that microbiome

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.410 align:middle line:84%
where the actual intestinal
wall starts to get injured.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So if your intestinal wall
starts getting holes in it,

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.180 align:middle line:84%
junk is bleeding
into your bloodstream

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and then going all
over your body.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:84%
The key is we got
to remove that.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
We got to remove the
offending items, fix the diet,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and get her to heal.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start her
on the diet this week.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So a whole-food,
plant-based diet

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.477 align:middle line:84%
is really an unprocessed,
predominately plant-based food.

00:34:01.477 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:84%
That means vegetables and fruits
and whole grains and legumes,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.179 align:middle line:84%
all the foods that
are nutrient rich.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we can stimulate
your immune system,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:84%
remove the offending
things you're

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.480 align:middle line:84%
doing to yourself
every day, you'll

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.815 align:middle line:84%
heal way faster than it took
to get in the disease process.

00:34:20.815 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
beauty of healing.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:31.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the last decade or even
more so, the amount of research

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that's come out in the
scientific journals showing

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:43.280 align:middle line:84%
without any shadow of a doubt
that there is such a thing

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:90%
as a mind-body connection--

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thinking, believing,
emotions all cause really

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
substantial chemical
and physiological,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.810 align:middle line:84%
biological changes all
throughout the body.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And I love that that's
how much of a transition

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:84%
we've made in the
last decade or two

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
from woo-woo stuff about
the mind-body connection

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:84%
to hard, factual,
scientific evidence.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I have a PhD in
organic chemistry.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:10%
It's nothing at all to
do with organic foods.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:10%
An organic chemist basically
plays the child's LEGO game,

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:10%
but we do it with atoms.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So people like me end up in
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So I worked for one
of the world's largest

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.970 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical companies
developing drugs

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
for cardiovascular
disease and for cancer.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And although I loved
doing what I was doing,

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I loved the science of it, but
what fascinated me more so,

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I would say, was what happens
when you test the drugs.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's say in a
typical trial you

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:84%
might give 100 people a
drug to show that it works.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So you've also got to give 100
people a placebo for comparison

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And you might get, say, 75
people improving on a drug.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's not uncommon to get
40, 50, 60, 70 74, 75 sometimes

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:84%
even also improving
on the placebo

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.020 align:middle line:84%
because they think
they're getting a drug.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, whoa,
that's amazing.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
What we see here is belief
itself shifts biology.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that's taught
enough in medical schools.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So how is it that you can
give someone a sugar pill,

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:20.190 align:middle line:84%
a saline injection, or perform
some false surgery or treatment

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and a certain percentage of
those people will accept,

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:84%
believe, and surrender to the
thought that they're getting

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the actual substance or
treatment and they begin

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
to program their autonomic
nervous system to make

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
their own pharmacy of chemicals
that matches the exact same

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
chemical they think
they're taking?

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, is
it the inert substance

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that's doing the healing or is
it the body's innate capacity

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.560 align:middle line:90%
to heal?

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everyone seems to be
aware of the placebo effect,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.528 align:middle line:90%
the result of positive thinking.

00:36:56.528 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:10%
The important question
is this-- what

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.410 align:middle line:10%
is the consequence
of negative thinking?

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, guess what?

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It's equally powerful in
influencing your life,

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:84%
but it works in the
opposite direction.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.510 align:middle line:84%
While a placebo,
positive thinking,

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:84%
can cure you of anything,
a nocebo, negative belief,

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.330 align:middle line:84%
can actually cause any
illness and can cause death

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:90%
just because you believe that.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We give too much authority
to someone in a white coat.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:10%
You know, I remember
one time someone came in

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:10%
and they were really crying
because they had received

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.690 align:middle line:10%
a tremendous diagnosis
and prognosis,

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:10%
and the doctor said, the
doctor said, the doctor said.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:90%
So I said, I'll be right back.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.415 align:middle line:84%
And I went out, and I got
a white coat and put it on,

00:37:46.415 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and I put my name tag on, and
it said Dr. Michael Beckwith.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And I came in.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm Dr.
Michael Beckwith,

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to know that
your life is about to get

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:90%
better and better and better.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You've had a tremendous wake-up
call about tremendous habits

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that you have had
for many, many years.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You're about to break that
cycle of those bad habits,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.347 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
watch your body change.

00:38:08.347 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You're going to watch
yourself come into a greater

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:90%
sense of fulfillment.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a
prescription tablet,

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and I said, every
day, this is what

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I want you to say to yourself.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.310 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want you to read.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:21.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want
you to not eat.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want you to eat.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Come see me in 30 days
and tell me how you feel.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And she went from
crying to just laughing

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.362 align:middle line:84%
because she realized that
she had given her power away.

00:38:32.362 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
don't go to a doctor.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you don't
follow good medical advice.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you just give yourself
over to an external authority

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:84%
figure, you basically
become a victim twice,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
victim to the condition
and the diagnosis,

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and now you become a victim to
an authority figure telling you

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:84%
about what's going to
happen in your life.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.783 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so believe the diagnosis.

00:38:56.783 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Now you can do
something about it.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.410 align:middle line:90%
But don't believe the prognosis.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Prognosis is when
somebody says, you

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:84%
have three months to live or
60% of people die in six months.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.360 align:middle line:10%
It's like telling what
the temperature is now,

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:10%
knowing the average
temperature for the year.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.325 align:middle line:10%
If you're from New York City
and the average temperature

00:39:16.325 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:10%
is 75 degrees, it
doesn't tell me

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:10%
what the temperature
is right now.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, statistics
are impersonal,

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and you are a person, and no
one knows what you're capable

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:90%
of or where you're going to go.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.170 align:middle line:84%
If someone says, well,
there's a less than 1%

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:84%
chance of recovering from
the kind of cancer you have,

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:84%
well, someone's got to be that
1%, and why couldn't it be you?

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important for people to
understand when they're given

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:46.100 align:middle line:84%
a diagnosis that if they fall
prey to the prognosis without

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.130 align:middle line:84%
actually considering that
there's other options,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:84%
without actually realizing that
they may have to do something

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
differently, that they may
have to make new choices,

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that they are going to have
to get beyond certain emotions

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and overcome their
limited thinking.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
If they can understand that
if they're able to do that,

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:84%
more possibilities
open up as the result

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.650 align:middle line:90%
of their own personal changes.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start to see
all kinds of magical things

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:84%
start to appear in
a person's life.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When the doctors gave you
the diagnosis and the prognosis,

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.990 align:middle line:84%
were they trying to rush you
into chemo and radiation?

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:10%
Like--

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, and I wasn't going to
do it, because I always swore,

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:10%
with the acupuncture background,
that I believe in natural

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:10%
medicine and natural healing.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.150 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't going to do it.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go to
any of the places that

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:84%
do the natural healing
with the juices and things.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have a brother
that's a rocket scientist,

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and I value his opinion.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.043 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Lizzy, you're
not going to make it.

00:40:54.043 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:84%
You've been juicing
all your life.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.740 align:middle line:84%
More juice isn't going
to save your life.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.657 align:middle line:90%
You've got stage four.

00:40:57.657 --> 00:40:59.900 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do something.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But it still took me
another month and a half

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:90%
because I wouldn't do it.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I was going to not do the chemo.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, finally, enough
people gathered me up

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and brought me in.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing a
lot of spiritual healing.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.670 align:middle line:84%
My friends did a fundraiser
that went kind of fast and wild

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
because people were
like, oh my gosh,

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.100 align:middle line:84%
if Elizabeth Craig has got
cancer, we're all going to die.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So they raised the money for me.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.887 align:middle line:90%
So I started doing--

00:41:32.887 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:84%
going to all the alternative
healers I could find,

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.917 align:middle line:84%
because I thought,
if nothing else,

00:41:36.917 --> 00:41:38.750 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can just
chronologue the whole thing

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and share it with people,
and then it'll be--

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.240 align:middle line:90%
people will learn from that.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Dianne Porchia was one
of the people I called.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And she's a spiritual
psychologist.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Healing Topanga.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Originally, the primary
purpose for calling her was

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.990 align:middle line:10%
so that I could die not afraid,
because I was afraid to die.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said that it
wasn't looking good.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This guy's fear,
panic, or an anxiety.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:90%
But I turn him around--

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But through the process,
instead of that happening,

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.957 align:middle line:90%
I started to feel miracles.

00:42:14.957 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The first session that we had
together was actually the day

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that she got her
chest port put in.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that she
was going to arrive with that,

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and that was such a tremendous
first step that she had to take

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.758 align:middle line:90%
in her cancer treatment.

00:42:30.758 --> 00:42:32.675 align:middle line:84%
>> They've got me on a
cocktail, they call it.

00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:36.810 align:middle line:10%
I had one, mitomycin,
that was in a little bag,

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:40.730 align:middle line:10%
and they ran it into
the port, and then

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.280 align:middle line:10%
they attached me to this one.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.150 align:middle line:10%
>> It's so stressful to think
that someone is invading

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:10%
your body and then
having medicine,

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:10%
which we know is very scary.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, so she had to
make friends with that.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people get the port
in their arm, their upper arm,

00:42:59.570 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and other people
get it in the chest.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Dianne just kept working with
me and saying, this is medicine,

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.970 align:middle line:84%
it's going to heal you,
this is good for you.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that made all
the difference in the world.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to relate to it
as something that is targeted

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.350 align:middle line:84%
medicine, see it as little
Pac-Mans or little soldiers

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that are there just
attacking the cancer cells,

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:25.670 align:middle line:84%
leaving everything else
intact and not being harmed,

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.305 align:middle line:84%
because the body does
want to move into balance.

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I started calling him-- because
he was my little chemo pack,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I called him Chemo Sabe.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Chemo Sabe, all right.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Dianne helped me change my
attitude that he was medicine

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and not poison.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The power of belief is--

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.460 align:middle line:90%
it's almost everything.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
What you are believing and
thinking at this moment

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
is telling your immune
system to either stop and not

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:84%
work because we got to run
from a stressor or everything's

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.240 align:middle line:90%
cool.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we relax,
and if there's

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:84%
anything that needs to
be cleaned up, clean up.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
You're either in fight or flight
or you're in rest and repair,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's your beliefs
that toggle that switch.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.310 align:middle line:90%
So beliefs are everything.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in 1968, I was learning
how to clone stem cells.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.810 align:middle line:10%
And back at that
time, just a handful

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:10%
of people in the entire world
even knew what a stem cell was.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.000 align:middle line:10%
So I was in the right
place at the right time

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.610 align:middle line:10%
to make some
interesting discoveries.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I put one stem cell
in culture by itself.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It divides every 10 or 12 hours.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.510 align:middle line:84%
At first, there's one, then
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, doubling.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So I have 50,000
genetically identical cells.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:90%
That's not the experiment.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:90%
This is.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I split the cells into three
different Petri dishes.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I change
the chemical composition

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.370 align:middle line:90%
of the culture medium.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Culture medium is the
equivalent of blood.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.247 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm growing mouse
cells, then what I do

00:44:59.247 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:84%
is look at mouse blood,
see what it's made out of,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and then try to make a synthetic
version of that called culture

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:90%
medium.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:90%
So here's the point--

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.310 align:middle line:84%
genetically identical
cells in three dishes

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.170 align:middle line:84%
but slightly
different environment

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.060 align:middle line:90%
because of the chemistry.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:84%
In one dish, the
cells form muscle.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:84%
In a second dish,
the cells form bone.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And in a third dish, the
cells form fat cells.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Significance-- what controls
the fate of the cells?

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Point-- they were all
genetically identical.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:84%
The environment is what was
selecting the genetic activity

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:90%
of the cells.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> People who have the
same DNA, who have the same

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.570 align:middle line:84%
susceptibility to illness, one
can become ill and the other

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:90%
can stay well.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.980 align:middle line:84%
One can heal, and
the other can't,

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
all because they optimize the
environmental factors that

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.820 align:middle line:90%
control gene activity.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the field
of epigenetics is all about.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The nature of
biology is simple.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.470 align:middle line:10%
Biological organisms
adapt their biology

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:05.920 align:middle line:10%
to fit into an environment.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm looking at the
activity of my liver cells

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.860 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and I say,
well, my liver cells

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.390 align:middle line:84%
should be adjusting to what's
going on in the environment.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, how does
a liver cell know what's

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:90%
going on in the environment?

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this--

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the liver cell is not
touching the environment.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the nervous
system to send information

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:84%
about the environment
inside the body,

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:84%
so the cells adjust
their biology

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to match what's going
on in the world.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, we only have one problem
with that, and that is this--

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.120 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is
an interpretation.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:43.890 align:middle line:10%
So my mind is interpreting
the environment.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So if I change my
perception, my mind,

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:84%
change my belief about
life, I change the signals

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that are going in and adjusting
the function of the cell.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The point is very,
very significant.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:47:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I, by my ability to
change my environment

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and by my ability to change my
perception of the environment,

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.800 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to control
my genetic activity.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a victim of my heredity.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:12.077 align:middle line:84%
I'm a master of my
genetic activity.

00:47:12.077 --> 00:47:14.938 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.938 --> 00:47:16.980 align:middle line:84%
In understanding how we
deal with the environment

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and deal with
perception, there is

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.722 align:middle line:84%
a mind between the
environment and my cells.

00:47:22.722 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "the
mind," everyone

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:84%
thinks of a single
entity, "the mind."

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.620 align:middle line:84%
The mind is comprised of two
interdependent elements that

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.130 align:middle line:84%
work together, and
that's the conscious mind

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and the subconscious mind.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:40.970 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind, the
latest evolution of the brain,

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.650 align:middle line:90%
is the creative mind.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:47.460 align:middle line:84%
When the conscious mind
is engaged in thinking,

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious is the
default program, the autopilot.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So my conscious mind
could be engaged,

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.180 align:middle line:84%
but my subconscious
mind will carry out

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:84%
whatever chore I'm doing--
walking, driving the car,

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
another person.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't need my
conscious mind for that.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I already have programs of
how to do all those things.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.190 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
world, we're actually

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.670 align:middle line:84%
operating through the
subconscious mind.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The programs in the
subconscious mind

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
primarily came from downloading
other people's behaviors--

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:84%
your mother, your father,
your siblings, your community,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and the first seven
years of life.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We are essentially an
open sponge to the world,

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.100 align:middle line:10%
absorbing the patterns from
all of those people that we are

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.240 align:middle line:10%
exposed to and surrounded with.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So if we have caregivers
who are really conscious

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and have learned to
manage their emotions

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and heal their hurts
in a healthy way,

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.240 align:middle line:90%
that's a really good thing.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Very few people I
know were blessed

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.250 align:middle line:84%
enough to come from
those families.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's say we're growing
up in an environment where

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.190 align:middle line:84%
there's trauma in
the household--

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:84%
alcoholism, family conflict,
inflamed relationships.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:09.420 align:middle line:10%
And when we don't have tools to
process our emotions in a given

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:10%
moment, that becomes a memory
that's not fully formed.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We end up seeing our
self and the world

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:84%
around us as if we're
still four years of age

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:26.340 align:middle line:84%
in an environment of just
conflict and trauma and drama.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.990 align:middle line:84%
We filter and therefore feel
that again and again every time

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:35.460 align:middle line:84%
colors, sounds, smells,
taste, feelings get triggered.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We react as if that memory were
going on for the first time.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can attempt to outrun
the subconscious mind,

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.840 align:middle line:84%
just like you attempt
to outrun a shadow.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.057 align:middle line:84%
You got to turn
around to face it.

00:49:49.057 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You got to see the problem as
the portal and so recognizing

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that these symptoms and
stressors are meaningful

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and brilliantly intelligent
in waking us up.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:05.880 align:middle line:90%


00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going twice a
week to visit Dianne.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:12.370 align:middle line:84%
My brother would drive me
up and do the sessions.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
is every time-- well,

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:16.070 align:middle line:90%
after the first few--

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.450 align:middle line:84%
no, actually, I'd say every
one of them, I would think,

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
I'm going to say.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.298 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like
anything's wrong.

00:50:21.298 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, you know?

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll just talk.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow she would do,
like, an exercise or a thing,

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and then something
would come out,

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.990 align:middle line:84%
extracted from some place in the
past that I never-- you know,

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.930 align:middle line:84%
like talk therapy wouldn't get
to this or your own thinking

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:35.730 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I lovingly forgive and
release all of the past.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I choose to fill my
world with joy and love

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.730 align:middle line:90%
and approval of myself.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Working with Dianne, we started
working on all those feelings--

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.478 align:middle line:84%
the grief, the sadness,
the fear of the cancer

00:50:51.478 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and then things that were
deep down inside that I

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.640 align:middle line:84%
had no idea were residing,
like, old stuff that I really

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.630 align:middle line:90%
didn't even think of.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And why is that you?

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> She kind of takes
what everybody gives her,

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't
really ask for much,

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:90%
and she's gonna get better.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth identified a
time in her life when she felt

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:10.680 align:middle line:90%
really pathetic.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.140 align:middle line:10%
There was an
incident where she--

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.810 align:middle line:10%
all the kids were supposed
to bring something to school,

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:10%
and she brought Graham crackers.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:90%
That's all she had to bring.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And they made fun of her.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So she just kind of
adopted this belief

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that that was pathetic,
how pathetic that was.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And she carried that with
her for a lot of years,

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, into adulthood without
even understanding or realizing

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:43.650 align:middle line:84%
how that pathetic self-image
would carry forward

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in relationships and adult life.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.380 align:middle line:10%
Dear guide, ask the
spirit's assistance

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.520 align:middle line:10%
and go for the deepest healing.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.270 align:middle line:10%
The healing tools can
involve inner child

00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:59.898 align:middle line:10%
healing work, sacred anger work.

00:51:59.898 --> 00:52:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I've got it right now.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Boy, am I mad right now.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm mad.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.930 align:middle line:10%
>> So the sacred anger
work, when that comes up,

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:10.860 align:middle line:10%
when there's anger in a
session that's ready to move,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.080 align:middle line:10%
we will go out on
the back hillside,

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:19.350 align:middle line:10%
and we throw rocks and to throw
these rocks as hard as they can

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.850 align:middle line:10%
and move that stuck energy.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.370 align:middle line:90%


00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know that I had
such a detrimental mindset.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought that it was
a pretty good one.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But the cancer
personality style,

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.340 align:middle line:84%
the I don't want to be a
burden, the it's easier for me

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
to give love than
to ask for it, it

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:84%
was really important for me
to learn how to ask for help

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:43.980 align:middle line:90%
and connect--

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:90%
to connect.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.867 align:middle line:90%


00:52:48.867 --> 00:52:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there's this
tendency for people to feel

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:84%
like they did something
wrong if they got sick.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But if we aren't aware
that we have limiting

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and negative subconscious
beliefs running our lives,

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.330 align:middle line:84%
then we can't blame
ourselves for getting sick.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.820 align:middle line:84%
If we stay in fear
and resistance,

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.380 align:middle line:84%
we not only waste
valuable energy

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that we could use to heal,
but we are closed off

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to information and possibility.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.620 align:middle line:84%
If instead we ask
ourselves, what

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is this pain or condition
trying to tell me,

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.510 align:middle line:84%
it creates space
so that the answers

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.317 align:middle line:90%
can come into our awareness.

00:53:22.317 --> 00:53:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always, even
from when I was young,

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.040 align:middle line:84%
been fascinated with
health and wellness,

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.170 align:middle line:90%
being the best you can be.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.610 align:middle line:84%
It was always part of even
going through high school

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and college.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I came across
Ayurveda probably

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.985 align:middle line:90%
about 16 to 17 years ago.

00:53:42.985 --> 00:53:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting there,
and I was like, finally,

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.680 align:middle line:84%
someone knows what the
hell they're talking about.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The constitution
is with the water.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of my favorite
parts is that we have something

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:58.630 align:middle line:84%
called Samprapti, which is a
Sanskrit name which describes

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the process of how a disease
comes into existence.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.292 align:middle line:90%
And there's six stages.

00:54:03.292 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I first heard this,
it was just so beautiful

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.190 align:middle line:90%
and so simple.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first stage
is accumulation.

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You accumulate too much
of what we call a dosha.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Dosha is the quality of energy.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:90%
You've got too much fire.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.620 align:middle line:90%
You've got too much air.

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You've got too much earth
and water in your system.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.820 align:middle line:90%
So let's take fire.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:84%
If you accumulate too
much fire in your system,

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
you may have a symptom of, like,
a sour belch from time to time.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.100 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But that would be a sign
of there's too much heat

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.310 align:middle line:90%
in the system.

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:36.640 align:middle line:90%
The next stage is aggravation.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Now it becomes
aggravating to the system,

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.763 align:middle line:84%
so that what was
a sour belch now

00:54:41.763 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:84%
becomes a little
bit of heartburn.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't eat the food you
eat during the day haunt you

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, in this day
and age, no problem.

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.190 align:middle line:90%
We've got the solution, right?

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:52.180 align:middle line:84%
You take Prilosec,
Nexium, whatever.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't actually
deal with why do

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I have the imbalance, because
it's considered somewhat

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:90%
normal to have heartburn.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.980 align:middle line:90%
The next stage is spread.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.518 align:middle line:84%
So now the excess heat that's
in the system that hasn't been

00:55:02.518 --> 00:55:04.810 align:middle line:84%
addressed-- because that
individual is still eating too

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:07.720 align:middle line:84%
much spicy food, still
drinking alcohol,

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.820 align:middle line:84%
putting too much heat
into the system--

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.230 align:middle line:90%
spreads.

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:14.470 align:middle line:84%
The fourth stage
is localization.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So now that excess heat
that's in the system that

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.540 align:middle line:84%
started with
accumulation now finds

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.480 align:middle line:84%
a weak spot in the system where
we've lost some integrity.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, the guy
we're talking about

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:26.630 align:middle line:84%
was a football
player in high school

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and maybe took one too
many blows to the knee

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and his knee's a little funky.

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.000 align:middle line:84%
That would be an ideal place for
the excess heat to find a home.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So now that progresses over
time to maybe arthritis.

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes
manifest as disease.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the six stages,
it becomes diversified.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So now it actually alters
the tissue system itself.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it becomes
rheumatoid arthritis.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty of that system
is, if you understand those six

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:55.660 align:middle line:84%
stages, that if you
want to prevent disease,

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.250 align:middle line:90%
what do you prevent?

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Excess accumulation.

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Prevent buildup.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, where the biggest
buildup is is right here.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you see the
whole disease process

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:13.220 align:middle line:84%
applies to the physiology
and the psychology.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been e-mailing
back and forward--

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>> --before our meeting
today of things that you want

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.680 align:middle line:10%
to approach.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:28.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And why do you feel that it's
time for you to work on this?

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's the physical
aspect of it that's forcing me

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:38.430 align:middle line:84%
to realize that maybe there's
something more to it than just

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:45.260 align:middle line:84%
being sick physically, past
emotions that are maybe

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.410 align:middle line:90%
affecting me.

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go on a plane,
we're frightened, yeah?

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a physical response
to something that's happening

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.395 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, which is
we have sweaty palms.

00:56:57.395 --> 00:56:58.520 align:middle line:90%
We have heart palpitations.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's a physical response
to something emotional.

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:03.310 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, imagine if you were
denying something daily,

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:14.750 align:middle line:10%
and it has nowhere to go
until it starts to build.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:19.665 align:middle line:84%
Ad it builds, and it
builds, and it builds into--

00:57:19.665 --> 00:57:20.465 align:middle line:90%
pick your disease.

00:57:20.465 --> 00:57:23.150 align:middle line:90%


00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This idea that emotional
blockages can lead to physical

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:28.610 align:middle line:90%
blockages--

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:31.070 align:middle line:84%
so the idea, then,
is to release them.

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
however you want to.

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people let it
go in a Zumba class.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Other people went to see a
shaman and did soul retrieval.

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:41.060 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's across the board.

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:44.160 align:middle line:10%
Some people did
psychotherapy some people

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.760 align:middle line:10%
burned all the letters
from their ex-husband.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So it really is whatever
works, whatever's

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:51.890 align:middle line:84%
going to allow you to
let go of that anger,

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to let go of that
resentment or that grief

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.610 align:middle line:84%
or that trauma, especially
trauma, which can often

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:04.123 align:middle line:84%
be locked away inside your
brain in the subconscious part.

00:58:04.123 --> 00:58:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going to do
emotional freedom technique.

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:07.970 align:middle line:90%
We spoke about it the other day.

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And it took a little bit
to get to the emotions

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:16.200 align:middle line:84%
because you're so good at
delaying them and pretending--

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hiding them.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> --that everything's fine.

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:21.510 align:middle line:10%
And-- but we took
a lot of notes,

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:26.570 align:middle line:10%
and the emotional
freedom is being

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.120 align:middle line:10%
able to go there, being
able to go to the thing

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:35.000 align:middle line:10%
that we suppress and
allow it to come up.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.365 align:middle line:90%
I'm frightened of the unknown.

00:58:36.365 --> 00:58:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened
of the unknown.

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened
of what I know--

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:41.235 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened
of what I know--

00:58:41.235 --> 00:58:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what I don't know.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what I don't know.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm frightened
of what I know--

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm frightened
of what I know--

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.500 align:middle line:10%
>> --and what I don't know.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what I don't know.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.823 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened
of what I know--

00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened
of what I know--

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what I don't know.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what I don't know.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened of
what might come up.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.597 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm frightened of
what might come up.

00:58:55.597 --> 00:58:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When we have an
emotion within our hearts,

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.460 align:middle line:84%
that emotion sends a
signal to our brain,

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and the quality of that signal
determines what the brain does

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.050 align:middle line:90%
in response to the emotion.

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you can imagine a signal
from the heart to the brain

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that is a very smooth series of
waves, nice, even, coherent--

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:25.990 align:middle line:90%
is the term that's used--

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:28.010 align:middle line:84%
waves from the
heart to the brain.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The brain will match that
smooth, even, organized

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.130 align:middle line:90%
chemistry.

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And it will release
the chemistry that

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:36.430 align:middle line:90%
supports life into our bodies.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:38.740 align:middle line:84%
This is where our immune
systems become really

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.812 align:middle line:90%
strong, super immune response.

00:59:40.812 --> 00:59:42.520 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
the stress chemistry--

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.400 align:middle line:84%
when we feel those moments
of frustration, anger, hate,

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.448 align:middle line:84%
jealousy, rage, fear, the
signal looks different.

00:59:48.448 --> 00:59:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It looks kind like a bad
day on the stock market.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:56.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of very chaotic,
unorganized, jagged waves going

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:57.490 align:middle line:90%
from the heart to the brain.

00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And the brain
receives those waves

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and says, oh, I need to
match this chemistry.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.390 align:middle line:90%
This is stress chemistry.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're in
a state of stress,

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.360 align:middle line:84%
our energy field goes into
a state of resistance.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.860 align:middle line:90%
That's why polygraph works.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're able to read it.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
In that energy, our
blood is affected.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't flow as effectively.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Heats up, cools down.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.980 align:middle line:84%
When we're in stress,
there's resistance.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.500 align:middle line:90%
That affects our pH.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And we become more acidic when
we're in a state of stress.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
In a localized or systemic
full-body acidity,

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.450 align:middle line:90%
inflammation occurs.

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a reactive way of
pumping more blood to attempt

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to help with healing.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.540 align:middle line:10%
However, we're starting to
go down a slippery slope

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.090 align:middle line:10%
because that
inflammation is a fire,

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:55.770 align:middle line:10%
and that fire starts
to burn the house down.

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.720 align:middle line:10%
>> So we have things building.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, maybe.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Things just build
and build and build,

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.988 align:middle line:84%
and then they come
out in the skin.

01:01:02.988 --> 01:01:03.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Things that you pretend
don't bother you.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> What about your mother?

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned your
mother in the email.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.457 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't even go there.

01:01:15.457 --> 01:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You can go there.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
This is the opportunity.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're estranged.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't speak.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been off and on like
that for 10 years, maybe more.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%


01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Is she ill?

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Mentally?

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I would say so.

01:01:34.644 --> 01:01:36.390 align:middle line:90%
She's on Valium.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
She's on a lot of stuff
before, and she's weaned down

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:40.500 align:middle line:90%
over the years, I think.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's very-- it
affected her a lot.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.950 align:middle line:90%
You know, just--

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.575 align:middle line:84%
OK, you have to go pay the rent,
you have to do this, you know,

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
all of this at a very young
age, third, fourth grade.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.225 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot of
responsibility very young.

01:01:55.225 --> 01:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I started driving
very young so I

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
could drive her to
work and drop her off,

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
ironing her outfit for work
or doing certain things that

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:02.390 align:middle line:90%
just were a lot.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You were the
mother of the mother.

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:10.130 align:middle line:90%


01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:12.097 align:middle line:90%
Where's your father?

01:02:12.097 --> 01:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, he couldn't deal
with her craziness either,

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
so he left when I was maybe 11.

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:18.462 align:middle line:84%
He just left and
never came back.

01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've never
seen him since?

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready?

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:27.363 align:middle line:90%
Take a nice deep breath.

01:02:27.363 --> 01:02:32.790 align:middle line:90%


01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.810 align:middle line:90%

>> Take a deep breath.

01:03:49.697 --> 01:03:55.610 align:middle line:90%


01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:56.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:57.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:03:57.386 --> 01:04:01.780 align:middle line:90%


01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.868 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you feel
about her now?

01:04:04.868 --> 01:04:05.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

01:04:05.832 --> 01:04:15.010 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Every authentic spiritual
path has some mention or some

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.120 align:middle line:90%
teaching around forgiveness.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I always say that
all forgiveness

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is self-forgiveness,
because the resentment I

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
may hold towards another
or the unforgiveness

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
or the rancor or the resentment,
all of those thoughts

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
are happening within me.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Even if someone did me wrong,
I still have those thoughts.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.835 align:middle line:90%
Those thoughts are affecting me.

01:04:41.835 --> 01:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
They're affecting
my body temple.

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
They're affecting
my blood chemistry.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.990 align:middle line:90%
They're affecting everything.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So when I begin to forgive
the so-called other person,

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm releasing rancor,
resentment, animosity.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm releasing all that
unforgiveness so that I'm

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
actually forgiving myself.

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't necessarily
let the other person

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
off the hook for whatever
they did or didn't do

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or should have done or
should not have done.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:10.640 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with them.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.980 align:middle line:90%
It has everything to do with me.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Forgiveness, when
it comes to emotions,

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:17.770 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest
access to letting go.

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The hatred you
have over a parent,

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
the judgment you
have of a coworker,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
the wrong-making you
have towards your spouse,

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.880 align:middle line:84%
just let go of that inner
judgment, blame, and basically

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.800 align:middle line:90%
a victim mindset.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
If you can let go of that and
recognize that life is actually

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
working for you,
not against you,

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
then, again, you're going
to generate healing.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.990 align:middle line:90%


01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So now I have a really
good idea how trauma,

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.408 align:middle line:84%
negative emotions, and
subconscious beliefs can lead

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to disease and might be
something we have to look

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:58.580 align:middle line:90%
at in order to heal.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But what about the kids that
come into this world already

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
sick or children that get
sick at a really young age?

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Surely their condition can't be
a result of accumulated stress

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
or unprocessed trauma or
disempowering beliefs.

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do they get sick?

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:19.283 align:middle line:84%
>> So people ask me,
what about children?

01:06:19.283 --> 01:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, children,
young children

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that come into this world
with some condition,

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
how can that be from
their subconscious?

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Or is it?

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that is
that we simply don't know.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I just have to be honest and
say that every human that

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
emerges into this world, what
has happened before we got here

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
is different for all of us,
and we have no way of knowing.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we begin to
cross the boundaries of science

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality and the words
like "karma" or "destiny"

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.400 align:middle line:90%
or "fate."

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what those are.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
What I do know, without
any shadow of a doubt,

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is once that being, once
that beautiful child arrives

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in this world, their
bodies, their cells,

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
their DNA will respond to the
environment and the conditions

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that we give to them.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to learn to
optimize those environments

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and those conditions.

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Individuals come
into the planet,

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and many of them come into
the planet because they know

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
they're going to go
through some stuff,

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming to uplevel
the awareness of the species.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So we don't look at it
like, well, this person was

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
born with this
disease, and that kid

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:33.100 align:middle line:84%
was born with that disease,
you know, what's wrong.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Many of these individuals are
coming with very special gifts.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
On another level, today,
a baby that's being born

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
is affected with tremendous--
more toxins than ever.

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The World Health
Organization's classed outdoor

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.010 align:middle line:90%
air pollution as carcinogenic--

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at so many
of the cancers, for instance,

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
we absolutely know--
this is not some mystery.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
We know where a lot
of these come from.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
They have to do with the
chemicals in the food.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
They have to do with
chemicals in the air.

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
They have to do with
chemicals in the Earth.

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So did human
consciousness create this?

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, but not necessarily
the consciousness of the person

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.310 align:middle line:90%
who contracted the disease.

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:14.730 align:middle line:84%
If you are truly treating
the Earth with reverence,

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
would you allow the level of
pollution and contaminants

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:19.020 align:middle line:90%
that we allow?

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.149 align:middle line:84%
If you were really thinking
about your children

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
with reverence and
wholly responsibility

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
to a future generation, would
you allow some of the things

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.430 align:middle line:90%
that we allow?

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So if the entire society
is allowing economic forces

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:38.807 align:middle line:84%
to prevail rather than real
humanitarian principles

01:08:38.807 --> 01:08:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and love of the Earth
and love of each other

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and love of our children, then
you get what we're getting.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine for a moment popping
a pill before bed that costs

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
about $13.50.

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:52.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, imagine waking
up the next morning,

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.830 align:middle line:10%
find that the price is
the exact same pill jumped

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.675 align:middle line:10%
to $750 overnight.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.300 align:middle line:10%
That is just what
happened to one drug.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.760 align:middle line:10%
Meg Tirrell joining us now
with that story and the man

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.179 align:middle line:10%
who is behind that price spike.

01:09:03.179 --> 01:09:03.979 align:middle line:90%
Meg.

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Brian.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Martin Shkreli joins
us now from the NASDAQ.

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:07.915 align:middle line:10%
He's the CEO of Turing
Pharmaceuticals.

01:09:07.915 --> 01:09:09.380 align:middle line:10%
Martin, thank you
for joining us.

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks for having me.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.319 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, you guys have said that
the reason you increased this

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.870 align:middle line:10%
price so much after acquiring
the drug was in order to do

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.359 align:middle line:10%
the research and development
to develop a better version

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:18.359 align:middle line:10%
of Daraprim.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:20.192 align:middle line:10%
I just got off the
phone with an HIV doctor

01:09:20.192 --> 01:09:22.609 align:middle line:10%
who told me they don't need a
better version of this drug.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the most money
going into health care than any

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.790 align:middle line:84%
country in the world today,
and we have some of the worst

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.740 align:middle line:90%
statistics of health care.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.750 align:middle line:90%
The problem is this--

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical industry
is a corporate industry.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Corporations-- what
are corporations?

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They're systems where
people invest money

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.830 align:middle line:90%
so they can make a profit.

01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I entered the pharmaceutical
industry as a young scientist,

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.859 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted
to cure cancer.

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:52.220 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that most
of my friends and colleagues

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.980 align:middle line:10%
in the pharmaceutical industry,
all the scientists also, just

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.030 align:middle line:10%
wanted, a lot of them, to
cure cancer, save lives.

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:01.130 align:middle line:10%
It's only when you get
higher up in the company

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.870 align:middle line:10%
that the goals begin to change.

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:04.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Martin, we do
appreciate you coming.

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.068 align:middle line:10%
I got to ask you
one more question.

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:08.078 align:middle line:10%
In response to all
of this attention

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:09.620 align:middle line:10%
and doctors and
patient groups saying

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.670 align:middle line:10%
they can't access this drug, are
you going to change the price?

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.100 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So in my examination
of pharmaceutical products

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in general, I began
to notice a pattern.

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern is that we are
told that there is a problem.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And the problem may not actually
exist, at least not in the way

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:31.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're told that it does.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we're offered
a product based

01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
on resolution of
the fear inspired

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.350 align:middle line:90%
by awareness of this problem.

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:43.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Sleep-- remember when it
welcomed you like a friend?

01:10:43.786 --> 01:10:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Then, it became more elusive.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.130 align:middle line:90%
But why?

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
When you have insomnia,
it may affect the wake

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitters in your brain,
disrupting your wake and sleep

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.680 align:middle line:90%
messages.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>> And in fact, if you follow
and dig into the literature,

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:03.300 align:middle line:10%
what you'll find is that the
very product that's offered

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:07.080 align:middle line:10%
to solve the problem actually
creates and perpetuates

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.050 align:middle line:10%
the problem it
purports to resolve.

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:12.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Hallucinations, the temporary
inability to move while falling

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.400 align:middle line:10%
asleep or waking up, and
temporary leg weakness have

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.960 align:middle line:10%
also been reported.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.130 align:middle line:10%
In depressed patients,
worsening depression,

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:21.400 align:middle line:10%
including risk of
suicide, may occur.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.530 align:middle line:10%
Alcohol may increase
these risks.

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:26.152 align:middle line:10%
Side effects include
next-day drowsiness.

01:11:26.152 --> 01:11:28.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Pharmaceutical industry
looks at the destination that it

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:33.440 align:middle line:10%
wants to fix and ignores the
fact that when you add a drug

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.310 align:middle line:10%
there are multiple drug
interactions which are not side

01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:39.438 align:middle line:10%
effects but direct effects.

01:11:39.438 --> 01:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have that, and then we
have to look at the efficacy,

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
like, do these
meds actually work?

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Could those risks be worth it?

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And that evidence
is really even more

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
concerning because we have
a body of evidence that

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
suggests that these
medications are

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
no better than a
placebo, a placebo,

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of course, which wouldn't
incur those same risks.

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
bigger question of,

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
what are you opting out of
when you choose to manage

01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:07.280 align:middle line:90%
your symptoms in this way?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a story I
really love which

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.678 align:middle line:84%
talks about a caterpillar
that's in the chrysalis,

01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's struggling to
get out, and there's

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:16.887 align:middle line:84%
this little hole
in the chrysalis,

01:12:16.887 --> 01:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
and there's a man nearby.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of feels
bad for the caterpillar.

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:22.190 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to get out, right?

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So he takes a pair of scissors,
and he snips the chrysalis.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
caterpillar turns

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
into a butterfly that
dies, that never can fly,

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because it needs to go through
the process of emergence

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and struggle.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Literally, it
physically needs to do

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.605 align:middle line:90%
that to be able to manifest.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.888 align:middle line:90%


01:12:43.888 --> 01:12:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've really taken
to Dr. Emerson's protocols.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>> The nutrition?

01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's really helping,
and he's really good about

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.180 align:middle line:84%
keeping in communication,
even though he's in Hawaii.

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Your numbers are outstanding.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's unbelievable.

01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:58.908 align:middle line:84%
It's only been eight weeks that
you've been on our program,

01:12:58.908 --> 01:12:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and it's phenomenal.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So this last two flare-ups,
I haven't had the joint pains

01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:03.663 align:middle line:90%
since I started--

01:13:03.663 --> 01:13:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> --the nutrition.

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.163 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
biggest thing is, I mean,

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I can't even go up and down
the stairs to my bedroom.

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:11.612 align:middle line:84%
I have to, like, stay
downstairs, sleep downstairs.

01:13:11.612 --> 01:13:14.210 align:middle line:90%


01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, here we are.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We're about to go get a sound
healing from Dr. Jeffrey

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Thompson.

01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:21.890 align:middle line:90%


01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:26.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm putting these risk
sensors on her wrist.

01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:27.845 align:middle line:10%
This is just to
hold them in place.

01:13:27.845 --> 01:13:31.100 align:middle line:90%


01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
These wrist sensors
are connected

01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:35.773 align:middle line:90%
to this laptop over here.

01:13:35.773 --> 01:13:36.815 align:middle line:90%
It's got a little sensor.

01:13:36.815 --> 01:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%


01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It's collecting the electrical
information from your heart.

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
As the sound sweeps into the
correct range for her body,

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
we'll see her nervous
system beginning to respond.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And when it hits
the spot, I'm going

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to make a cue mark on my
program here so I can identify

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%
what frequency we need to use.

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%


01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
We use very precisely tuned
sound frequencies for healing.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
My innovation is to expose the
body to these precisely tuned

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
sound waves until I
find a sound wave that

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
makes the sympathetic nervous
system push in the clutch.

01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:25.810 align:middle line:90%


01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's getting there,
getting really close.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.243 align:middle line:90%


01:14:33.243 --> 01:14:34.160 align:middle line:90%
That's it right there.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%


01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
we're looking for is

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.020 align:middle line:84%
zero, zero stress in the
autonomic nervous system,

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.970 align:middle line:90%
or homeostasis.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, normally, I would
expect it to look

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.190 align:middle line:84%
like this, where
it comes down, hits

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that point and then goes
off into parasympathetic,

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
the green.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.100 align:middle line:90%
But hers didn't do that.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
She hit the point, but she went
back into the stress response

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.280 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It means that she's
had this chronic stress

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.160 align:middle line:90%
condition for a long time.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And when it begins to
respond to the sound waves

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to
push in the clutch,

01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
it took a little bit of
extra time to get there.

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But once it did get
there, it wasn't

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
able to completely cross over
and go into the relaxation

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
phase, which is what
parasympathetic nervous system

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:29.420 align:middle line:84%
is, the relaxation response,
because her nervous system is

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:35.233 align:middle line:84%
still too worried to go
there, to completely let go.

01:15:35.233 --> 01:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So people ask me,
what kind of condition

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.170 align:middle line:90%
can you heal with this?

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And my answer at this
point is anything

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that has stress as its cause.

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:50.727 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm concerned,
that's pretty much everything.

01:15:50.727 --> 01:15:53.980 align:middle line:90%


01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:15:57.944 --> 01:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the first words out
of everybody's mouth is "wow."

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.800 align:middle line:90%


01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, there we go.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:15.770 align:middle line:90%


01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What Dr. Thompson showed me
is that Eva is in a constant

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.590 align:middle line:90%
state of stress.

01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Even when she's relaxing,
it's hard for her

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to fully switch over into the
parasympathetic nervous system,

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
which is where you need
to be if you want to heal.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So that just proves to
me that healing really

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:33.820 align:middle line:84%
needs to take place
on multiple levels.

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.920 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
stress, the tool

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that's absolutely changed
my life and I know millions

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.000 align:middle line:90%
of others is meditation.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Meditation has been around
for thousands of years.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
The mind is yapping
all the time,

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's telling us generally
scary and limiting things.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:58.100 align:middle line:10%
The mind is wonderful when
you're using it as a tool.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not so great when
it's calling the shots.

01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
In the very first
research on meditation

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
done by a mentor of
mine, Dr. Herbert Benson,

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, it shuts down
the fight or flight response,

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the fear response,
and it stimulates

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic or relaxing
nervous system of the body.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what heals.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:29.313 align:middle line:84%
So at the very most basic level,
meditation relieves stress.

01:17:29.313 --> 01:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If you wake up in the
morning, you take a shower,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
you take a bath, because
you don't want to take

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
yesterday's dirt with
you out into the day.

01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But if I wake up in the
morning and I immediately

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
go to television or radio
or the computer or newspaper

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm taking in all
the stress of the world,

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
then I might cleanse
my body, but my mind

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.775 align:middle line:90%
is carrying so much stress.

01:17:52.775 --> 01:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why meditating
in the morning

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is as important as is taking
a bath, purifying your mind,

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.560 align:middle line:90%
purifying your consciousness.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many
kinds of meditation.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
There are meditations that
involve self-reflection.

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So you sit quietly, and
you ask yourself, who am I?

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
There are forms
of meditation that

01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
are called
self-questioning, which

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.340 align:middle line:90%
is questioning your beliefs.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Third form of meditation is
what is these days called

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness, which is a
terrible word because you're not

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
using your mind when you're
practicing awareness.

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:37.892 align:middle line:84%
The awareness of a
thought is not a thought.

01:18:37.892 --> 01:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there is what
is called transcendence,

01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
which is usually using a
technique like a mantra.

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
The mantra is kind
of a sound that

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
competes with your thoughts
and ultimately takes you

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
to a place where there is
no thought and no mantra,

01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
left with awareness.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.250 align:middle line:90%


01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So as we practice
these techniques,

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
we get in touch, my mind
with our core being,

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
our core consciousness,
which in spiritual traditions

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is often called the soul.

01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:20.280 align:middle line:90%


01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Your pituitary gland does
amazing things when you are

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
in meditation.

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It releases oxytocin,
dopamine, relaxant, serotonin,

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.440 align:middle line:90%
endorphins.

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything good that
your body can make

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
is released when you make
this spiritual connection.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
There really is this
internal process

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that we can flip on
like a light switch.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
We can flip on
these juices of life

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
if we just take a
moment to connect.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
meditation or prayer.

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It could be going
for a walk in nature.

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
But your mind needs to quiet.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Your breathing needs
to slow and you want

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
to feel that unshakable peace.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.400 align:middle line:90%


01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We did an amazing study
just a little ways back at one

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
of our advanced workshops.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
We took 120 people,
and we wanted

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to measure their
circulating cortisol levels

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and a chemical called
immunoglobulin A, or IgA.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
We put them through 4
and 1/2 days of training.

01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
4 and 1/2 days,

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.740 align:middle line:84%
we measured to see if there
were any epigenetic changes

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
or chemical changes that took
place by their internal work.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
We found that the
majority of people's

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
cortisol levels
diminished, which

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
means they were no
longer in survival.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:40.110 align:middle line:90%
They were no longer stressed.

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But the relevant
thing that happened

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
was that their IgA levels went
from about 51 and 1/2 to 83,

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:50.430 align:middle line:84%
right to the ceiling of
what's considered high.

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And some people were
up in the hundreds.

01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, IgA is the primary defense
against bacteria and viruses.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It's greater than any flu shot.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:07.850 align:middle line:90%


01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The best part of our
meditation is it doesn't cost

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.930 align:middle line:90%
anything.

01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:14.510 align:middle line:90%
You can do it anywhere, anytime.

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Just quiet the mind and get rid
of that excess mental baggage.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.230 align:middle line:90%


01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:23.030 align:middle line:90%
But the mind isn't all bad.

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
use your imagination

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
through visualization to
activate a powerful healing

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.230 align:middle line:90%
response.

01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What if I told you to do a
simple exercise of imagination,

01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to go to your refrigerator,
open it up, find a lemon,

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.080 align:middle line:84%
take the lemon, put it
on the cutting board,

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
cut the thing in half,
take a look at it--

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.660 align:middle line:90%
juice is welling up--

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and stick out your
tongue and lick it.

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Your salivary glands
would go crazy,

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and it was all in
your imagination.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's no question
that what we imagine

01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:04.040 align:middle line:90%
can affect our physiology.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.290 align:middle line:10%
>> For several years, I've
been collecting stories,

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:10.580 align:middle line:10%
testimonies, interviewing
several hundred people

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.420 align:middle line:10%
who've used visualization as
some part of their healing

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.410 align:middle line:10%
journey.

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And amazingly, what,
like, 99% of them do

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is you take an internal
picture of illness

01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and convert it into an
internal picture of wellness.

01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:25.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:26.900 align:middle line:90%
It's illness to wellness.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.700 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And they just do it over
and over and over again.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So to give you a few examples
of the strategy of illness

01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to wellness, people who are even
getting chemotherapy the chemo

01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:39.846 align:middle line:84%
drugs as little piranha
fish going, [MUNCHING]

01:22:39.846 --> 01:22:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and nibbling at the tumor.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.528 align:middle line:10%
But in their mind's
eye, what they're seeing

01:22:43.528 --> 01:22:46.195 align:middle line:10%
is the tumor getting smaller and
smaller and smaller and smaller

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:47.420 align:middle line:10%
till it's got.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
People in radiotherapy
imagine the radiation

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that bolts of lightning going
pew, pew, pew, pew, pew,

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and bombing chunks
out of the tumor.

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
But again, tumor's getting
smaller and smaller and smaller

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
till it's gone.

01:22:56.630 --> 01:23:01.840 align:middle line:90%


01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Toward the end of the
treatment, I was really weak.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So Dianne called,
and she said, do you

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:08.980 align:middle line:90%
want to have your session?

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.647 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
think I can make it.

01:23:10.647 --> 01:23:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I can't really get up.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I was just laying down a lot.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't really get up.

01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so she came to visit
me to give me a session.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And when she got there,
I was just shaking.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So she said, I think
you're running a fever.

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the thermometer,
and it was 103.5.

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So she said, we need to
take you to the hospital.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So she drove me to
the hospital, and it

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:30.950 align:middle line:90%
was going up as we're driving.

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:33.480 align:middle line:90%


01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I got to the emergency
room, and they

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
started giving antibiotic
bags one after another,

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and nothing was working.

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I just remember I could
hear my heartbeat.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
It was like I could hear
water and air, [WHOOSHING]

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.400 align:middle line:90%
really loud.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.480 align:middle line:90%
The fever kept going up.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of thought, oh,
I wonder if this is it.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.190 align:middle line:90%


01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up, my brother
was standing outside the glass

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%
door with a laptop.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me,
they're praying for you.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
They did a group prayer on
Facebook with over 100 people.

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:11.664 align:middle line:84%
And right after that,
I kind of came out.

01:24:11.664 --> 01:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> How could my prayer,
how could my meditation,

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
how could my loving thoughts
of gratitude and appreciation

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
possibly impact the healing of
another person in the room with

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
me or halfway around the world?

01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
that we are deeply

01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
connected through a phenomenon
that is known as entanglement.

01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Entanglement is the term
in physics that tells us,

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:46.850 align:middle line:84%
once something is unified, once
something begins as a whole,

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
even though it is separated
physically by many miles

01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
or light years-- is what
they're finding in the cosmos--

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.470 align:middle line:84%
energetically, everything's
still connected.

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go back
far enough in time,

01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
there was a point in time
when you, me, and the Earth

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
were all connected
before what is

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
called the Big Bang, the
big release of energy.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:15.470 align:middle line:84%
When that happened, physically,
particles began to separate.

01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, the
particles remain connected.

01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:21.410 align:middle line:90%
We are part of this Earth.

01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And we are part of one another.

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And that empowers
you and it empowers

01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
me to participate in the
healing of our bodies

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and those of our loved ones
in ways that science is only

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.780 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.860 align:middle line:90%


01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So entanglement explain
scientifically how our prayers

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.270 align:middle line:90%
might work.

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole
aspect of faith and prayer

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that can't be explained
through science.

01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
People travel all over
the world to holy sites

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to receive energy
or faith healing.

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it their unshakable belief
in God's power and therefore

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:57.370 align:middle line:84%
the placebo effect that is
responsible for the healing?

01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Or is there an
actual divine energy

01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that is causing
their transformation?

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Either way, I'm fascinated
by the mystical.

01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And if faith healing
works for people,

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
why not respect the possibility
and keep an open mind?

01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:15.174 align:middle line:90%


01:26:15.174 --> 01:26:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody take a nice breath.

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tell you
a little bit about me,

01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:22.540 align:middle line:84%
because you might
be a little curious.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I was born into a
very religious family.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%
We were taught to pray, right?

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
We were taught to
ask God for help.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.650 align:middle line:10%
So what I learned as a child
was that if you trust--

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:40.740 align:middle line:10%
if you ask God and you
trust and you believe

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:46.270 align:middle line:10%
and then you get out of the
way, then anything's possible.

01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a brain tumor
called a meningioma,

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.920 align:middle line:90%
and there is no cure for it.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.722 align:middle line:84%
So you're constantly
wondering, what's

01:26:51.722 --> 01:26:52.930 align:middle line:90%
going on inside of your head?

01:26:52.930 --> 01:26:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it growing?

01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have things like
that and a little bit of fear

01:26:58.090 --> 01:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know
if the thing's going

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:01.945 align:middle line:90%
to explode and grow faster.

01:27:01.945 --> 01:27:04.780 align:middle line:90%


01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So please understand,
I'm not doing anything.

01:27:07.410 --> 01:27:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Please understand
that everything

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that you'll see happen is
coming from the divine.

01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:16.470 align:middle line:90%
There are no spirit guides.

01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.640 align:middle line:90%
There are no entities.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm just grateful that,
for whatever reason,

01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:24.800 align:middle line:84%
the divine has chosen
me to work through.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Let all that stuff go.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me get all of it,
every last bit of it.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Let me have it.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:43.540 align:middle line:90%


01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Shake your head.

01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Shake your hand.

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Shake it out.

01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:48.730 align:middle line:90%
New hairdo.

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:50.503 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

01:27:50.503 --> 01:27:51.420 align:middle line:90%
You doing OK, brother?

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:55.702 align:middle line:84%
>> You came in
here wanting this,

01:27:55.702 --> 01:27:57.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever's going on
with you, to be gone,

01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and so they're
taking that as a--

01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm cleaning.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.627 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm vibrating.

01:28:03.627 --> 01:28:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Does he look different?

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:05.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:28:05.914 --> 01:28:08.690 align:middle line:90%


01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice work.

01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> My face was, like,
on fire, so to speak.

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It was electrical
current and pulse,

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
but it went throughout
my whole body.

01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I stood
up, I was shaking.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.440 align:middle line:90%
But it was a good shake.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.283 align:middle line:90%
It was different.

01:28:22.283 --> 01:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I've never felt anything
like this in my life.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.144 align:middle line:90%
Oh-wee, man.

01:28:25.144 --> 01:28:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Holy shit.

01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh-wee.

01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh-wee.

01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:32.730 align:middle line:90%


01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Holy shit.

01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:46.150 align:middle line:90%


01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, this is why I get
up in the morning, right here.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all of you.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.920 align:middle line:90%
But this is like the perfect--

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.953 align:middle line:90%
like, you see what's possible.

01:28:55.953 --> 01:28:56.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

01:28:56.915 --> 01:28:59.801 align:middle line:90%


01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:01.595 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:29:01.595 --> 01:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you noticing
in your body so far?

01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:06.240 align:middle line:90%


01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I thought it would be
really hard to let go because I

01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:10.740 align:middle line:10%
don't know who I am
without being sick.

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well-- and?

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like I've tried--

01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:17.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to--

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>> You're do it, girl.

01:29:19.130 --> 01:29:20.080 align:middle line:90%
You're not trying.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.060 align:middle line:90%
You're doing.

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.722 align:middle line:90%
Big difference.

01:29:22.722 --> 01:29:23.694 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

01:29:23.694 --> 01:29:30.510 align:middle line:90%


01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:35.070 align:middle line:84%
What she just said is,
like, the bottom line

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:37.310 align:middle line:90%
with so many people.

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
it's going to be what,

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.050 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like to
be well, and it's scary,

01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:44.280 align:middle line:90%
so they don't go there.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:52.570 align:middle line:90%


01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> People say, well,
I don't have faith.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But actually, everyone
has faith of some kind.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.680 align:middle line:84%
You either have faith in
possibility or you have faith

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that that possibility
doesn't exist.

01:30:02.650 --> 01:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, we have more
faith in the power of cancer

01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to kill us than we have
faith in the power of God,

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.910 align:middle line:84%
the power of miracles, the
power of infinite possibility,

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the power of any force other
than what our eyes can see

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and our hands can touch
to actually interrupt

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.580 align:middle line:84%
the power and the
trajectory of disease.

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:30.100 align:middle line:90%


01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I had no idea what
was coming, you know?

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying to
prepare myself for whatever

01:30:35.230 --> 01:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
answer they gave me.

01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And Dianne took me
into the appointment,

01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and the oncologist said, well,
your scans came back all clear.

01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:46.915 align:middle line:90%
No cancer!

01:30:46.915 --> 01:30:54.906 align:middle line:90%


01:30:54.906 --> 01:30:55.880 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- just started crying
and laughing at the same time.

01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:04.065 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, we must
have misdiagnosed you.

01:31:04.065 --> 01:31:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.667 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think because
he didn't think it

01:31:07.667 --> 01:31:09.190 align:middle line:90%
could be resolved so quickly.

01:31:09.190 --> 01:31:09.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:12.565 align:middle line:90%


01:31:12.565 --> 01:31:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:17.580 align:middle line:84%
The regimen always was,
with everyone-- they said,

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.050 align:middle line:90%
it will be a two-year thing.

01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:23.340 align:middle line:84%
It'll be chemo first, then
chemoradiation, then surgery,

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
then more chemo, and that
would take two years.

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:29.587 align:middle line:90%
And mine was gone in one round.

01:31:29.587 --> 01:31:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> What were we doing last time?

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:31.837 align:middle line:90%
I did our evaluation--

01:31:31.837 --> 01:31:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And even my oncologist,
who I thought was the best

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.332 align:middle line:90%
of the-- that I could find.

01:31:36.332 --> 01:31:38.290 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, wow, it's
amazing, all of your hair

01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:39.830 align:middle line:90%
hasn't come out.

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:40.630 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

01:31:40.630 --> 01:31:41.505 align:middle line:90%
You look really good.

01:31:41.505 --> 01:31:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Your numbers are good and stuff.

01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
doing wheatgrass.

01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And he'd go, oh,
OK, well, whatever.

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you not
believe in wheatgrass?

01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:52.935 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, but if
it makes you feel better.

01:31:52.935 --> 01:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
They gave me two
different types.

01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And with the one, my hair
would have come out completely.

01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But with the two, yeah,
for sure, it was a goner.

01:31:59.930 --> 01:32:02.110 align:middle line:90%
And it never all came out.

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I still had a good
2/3 of it at the end.

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Love and all the time
in the world to enjoy it.

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The best part for me was
that I was supported by friends

01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and family and that I had
spiritual therapists that

01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
really helped me work through
all of this stuff and get rid

01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of the fear and the old hurts
and wounds and then allow me

01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to return to a really
high state of healing.

01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:33.590 align:middle line:90%


01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> If you perceive that people
are coming to help you and hold

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you and help you through this
process and you feel this

01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:42.560 align:middle line:84%
outpouring of love, they are
actually helping your body

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.110 align:middle line:84%
heal, because as soon
as you perceive that,

01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:48.680 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you believe that
people are sending you love,

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.420 align:middle line:90%
you have this oxytocin response.

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And oxytocin release
has been associated

01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
with increased natural killer
cells, increased white cells.

01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
The immune response just
goes through the roof.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:01.680 align:middle line:90%


01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important to
work with doctors that treat you

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:08.190 align:middle line:84%
as a whole person and surround
yourself with friends that

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
inspire hope and strengthen
in you rather than add

01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:13.340 align:middle line:90%
to your fear.

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.812 align:middle line:84%
It's hard, though, because
when I'm sick or in pain,

01:33:15.812 --> 01:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I feel vulnerable and just
want to crawl up in a ball

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.590 align:middle line:90%
and be alone.

01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So how do we break out of
that downward spiral of fear?

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:27.580 align:middle line:84%
How do we transcend the pain
and shift to a positive mindset?

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So when a person shows
up in a doctor's office

01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're given the diagnosis
of rheumatoid arthritis or MS

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or cancer or diabetes, once
they hear that diagnosis,

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:42.410 align:middle line:84%
the common emotions they
experience is either fear

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:43.430 align:middle line:90%
or sadness.

01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They can think
positively all they want.

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.820 align:middle line:84%
They can say, I'm going to
overcome this condition.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But if they are feeling
fear, that thought never

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
makes it past the
brainstem into the body

01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:58.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's not in
alignment with the body's

01:33:58.190 --> 01:33:59.810 align:middle line:90%
emotional state.

01:33:59.810 --> 01:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
You get that person to
change their emotional state

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and get them into a
state of gratitude.

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Why gratitude?

01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, we normally give
thanks when we get something.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you're giving thanks
in a state of gratitude,

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:16.670 align:middle line:84%
your body is believing
it's receiving something

01:34:16.670 --> 01:34:18.980 align:middle line:84%
because the emotional
signature of gratitude

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.385 align:middle line:90%
means it's already happened.

01:34:20.385 --> 01:34:22.920 align:middle line:90%


01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So the more that we can feel
the feeling as if our healing

01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:32.000 align:middle line:84%
has already occurred, giving
thanks for that healing already

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.650 align:middle line:84%
being present, that is the
trigger for our bodies to grow

01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
the nerve cells to make
the connections to trigger

01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:42.680 align:middle line:84%
the brain chemistry to
reflect that healing.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.440 align:middle line:90%


01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We have this advanced
nervous system

01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that we regulate
through the choices

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:55.670 align:middle line:84%
we make in our lives of
what we think, what we feel,

01:34:55.670 --> 01:34:58.670 align:middle line:84%
what we believe,
and specifically

01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:03.200 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that we
choose to respond to what

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.390 align:middle line:90%
life brings to our doorstep.

01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:11.580 align:middle line:90%


01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've been trying
not to take the steroids.

01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:35:14.970 --> 01:35:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went through a
small breakout last month,

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.200 align:middle line:90%
which I thought was good.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it was kind
of just dormant.

01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Like, it never really went away.

01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it all of a sudden
just exploded over the weekend.

01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have, like, these
massive boils that are

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.740 align:middle line:84%
starting, and then I have
them all over my chest.

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's like--

01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> This is like when
it's almost full blown.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not quite.

01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:42.635 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you have
something residing in you--

01:35:42.635 --> 01:35:45.010 align:middle line:84%
like, say you have Epstein-Barr
virus or say you have one

01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:46.240 align:middle line:90%
of the shingles viruses--

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.770 align:middle line:90%
stress can trigger it.

01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Mold can trigger it.

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Someone breaking your
trust can trigger it.

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Problems at work can trigger
it, being fired from your job--

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.480 align:middle line:90%
everything can trigger it.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be something
in there to trigger.

01:35:59.290 --> 01:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The key is knowing
what the real cause

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
is so you can live life
like a normal person

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and have things go wrong and
not go down because of it.

01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so my little flower
blossoms are turning into big

01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:14.070 align:middle line:90%
dahlias.

01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
merge together and get

01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
really huge and extremely
painful and hot,

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:27.150 align:middle line:84%
constantly burning up and
then getting the chills.

01:36:27.150 --> 01:36:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Powered through the day.

01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:42.010 align:middle line:90%


01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
They immediately
called some doctors

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and put me in
isolation because they

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.760 align:middle line:84%
didn't know if it
was contagious,

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:53.210 align:middle line:84%
viral, what was
going on, infectious.

01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I had some really
bad abdominal pains

01:36:56.210 --> 01:37:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and just this is just getting
so painful and intense.

01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So they called all
those specialists,

01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and they ran all these tests,
and everything came back

01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.180 align:middle line:90%
basically normal.

01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:10.330 align:middle line:90%


01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:13.243 align:middle line:84%
You know, as I got out, they
gave me just really heavy doses

01:37:13.243 --> 01:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of steroids to knock
it out because they

01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:17.580 align:middle line:84%
could see that I wasn't
getting better on its own.

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And then my dermatologist
was concerned

01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:23.040 align:middle line:84%
about me taking the steroids
after to initially knock out

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the breakout, so she gave me
a prescription of Dapsone,

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.900 align:middle line:90%
which is an antibiotic.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:30.868 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize the
strength of the antibiotic

01:37:30.868 --> 01:37:32.160 align:middle line:90%
until I went to the pharmacist.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.743 align:middle line:84%
He stopped me at the
counter and said,

01:37:33.743 --> 01:37:37.050 align:middle line:84%
do you know that this is a
really heavy dose of antibiotic

01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:38.190 align:middle line:90%
that you're taking?

01:37:38.190 --> 01:37:39.368 align:middle line:90%
So that's where I'm at.

01:37:39.368 --> 01:37:40.410 align:middle line:90%
I have to pick my poison.

01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Do I Band-Aid it
with steroids or do

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.205 align:middle line:84%
I take this heavy
antibiotic indefinitely?

01:37:46.205 --> 01:37:51.060 align:middle line:90%

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.448 align:middle line:90%
nobody can figure it out.

01:38:00.448 --> 01:38:02.490 align:middle line:84%
They give me drugs for
all these different things

01:38:02.490 --> 01:38:03.650 align:middle line:90%
that they think it may be.

01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:05.570 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, that's kind of the
process with Western medicine.

01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:07.200 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
because it's just

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.617 align:middle line:84%
let's just throw
everything at it,

01:38:08.617 --> 01:38:10.630 align:middle line:90%

01:38:10.630 --> 01:38:12.630 align:middle line:84%

go more often or they might

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.110 align:middle line:90%

01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%

with steroids, it's very easy.

01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:22.645 align:middle line:84%

and I'm better.

01:38:22.645 --> 01:38:24.270 align:middle line:84%
If I could get access
to these vitamins

01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and to these alternative
doctors at those nominal costs,

01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:30.840 align:middle line:84%
then I would probably
go much more often.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:36.880 align:middle line:90%


01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.700 align:middle line:84%

naturopath and all that

01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:41.730 align:middle line:84%

that's alternative.

01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I just can't seem
to dedicate myself.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:47.487 align:middle line:90%


01:38:47.487 --> 01:38:49.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe I'm
just emotionally

01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
stunted to do or open
myself up to that

01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:54.313 align:middle line:84%
or there's just something
that's blocking me,

01:38:54.313 --> 01:38:55.480 align:middle line:90%
because it seems achievable.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.242 align:middle line:84%
And in my condition,
I should be able to.

01:38:57.242 --> 01:38:58.450 align:middle line:90%
But for some reason, I can't.

01:38:58.450 --> 01:39:09.880 align:middle line:90%

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.980 align:middle line:84%
As a society, we've
been conditioned

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%

01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:22.060 align:middle line:90%

to work, they'd say, oh,

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.640 align:middle line:84%
great to have you back,
and then say, yeah,

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.760 align:middle line:84%
my so-and-so had
cancer, and then--

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.695 align:middle line:90%
oh, they were great.

01:40:02.695 --> 01:40:04.070 align:middle line:84%

had no cancer for two years.

01:40:05.255 --> 01:40:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And then 2 and 1/2 years later,
they-- oh, covered with cancer.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.080 align:middle line:90%
They died months later.

like the radiation.

But you have to do it.

01:40:21.930 --> 01:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I actually was manifesting
a lot of pain in my body.

01:40:26.410 --> 01:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you can't tell whether
it's from the radiation damage

or what's going on.

01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.740 align:middle line:90%
for sure it was coming back.

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.260 align:middle line:84%

very clear to me

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.740 align:middle line:84%
is that my body
wants to be healthy.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.300 align:middle line:90%

the most powerful moment,

the one where I had
the largest epiphany,

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:21.450 align:middle line:84%
was toward the end of
the chemo and radiation.

01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:22.378 align:middle line:90%
I was really weak.

01:41:22.378 --> 01:41:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And I told my brother, I just
wanted to go to the beach

01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:25.920 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to be in the sun.

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So he carried me and
laid me in the grass.

01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he went
out on the beach.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was just laying
there, looking at everybody.

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:39.470 align:middle line:84%

>> Rather than this being
something that you just read

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:44.650 align:middle line:84%
in a book or you watch
in a documentary,

01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:46.760 align:middle line:90%
put it into action.

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:47.560 align:middle line:10%
Fall down.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.190 align:middle line:10%
Get back up.

Fall down.
