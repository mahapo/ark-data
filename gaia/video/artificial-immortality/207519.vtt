00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So you get involved
with religion

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because it promises you
to live in heaven forever.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.860 align:middle line:84%
My belief is that a
technological solution

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:84%
can actually do
better and can improve

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
everyone's state
of consciousness,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.850 align:middle line:84%
much more reliably
than religions

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:90%
have managed to do so far.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.995 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.995 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Reflecting the
best of humanity--

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the aims of
Hossein's augmented eternity.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:41.042 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Since we last met, you
have provided some information

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:84%
about, let's say, some
key events in your life,

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
such as the birth of
your daughter, Aster.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting to look

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
at the system on how it responds
to these types of interactions

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:90%
and questions.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The AI's job is to learn
everything it can about me from

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:90%
my photos.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
In theory, it should
be able to answer

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
questions for my daughters
the same way I would.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
My daughter wanted to know how
I felt the day she was born.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> When you ask that question,
you provided a number

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
of images.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
It went and found
a picture that was

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
relevant to the day of birth,
and it used different types

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
of AI to identify
elements in that picture

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:90%
to come up with an answer.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It actually went and
created different features

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
from your face that will
identify mood or emotion.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It could feel that you were
94% relieved, 33% happy.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Then it went and generated
these answers for you.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
The system said, I
was relieved of stress

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.735 align:middle line:90%
and overwhelmed with happiness.

00:26:04.735 --> 00:26:09.205 align:middle line:84%
>> That's not how I would word
it, but the sentiment is right.

00:26:09.205 --> 00:26:12.145 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.145 --> 00:26:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's how Hossein's
AI system recreates memory.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:10%
I wonder how similar it is to
the way human brains create

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:10%
memories.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:10%
What connections are
made to form a memory?

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And what's lost when
that memory is gone?

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.738 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.738 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's great to
finally meet you.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.295 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so much
about your work,

00:26:31.295 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, great.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks for coming.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you to the dry
lab office I have here.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Taufik Valiante is a
neurosurgeon and scientist

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:90%
at the Krembil Brain institute.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>> When you hear about
artificial intelligence

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:10%
approximating the human
brain, what do you think?

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I think it's a
bit of a pie in the sky.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:10%
I think we know so
little about the brain.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So to imagine us being
able to create something

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
similar or akin to it is just--
it's very hard to imagine.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:10%
It's the most complex
structure in the universe.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Artificial intelligence systems
and networks are trained.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's very few
things, if anything,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that approximate the brain's
ability generalizes knowledge.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of the more difficult
functions that we try

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:90%
to measure is really memory.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.615 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm fascinated by the
first memories of childhood.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Is there a pattern?

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.147 align:middle line:84%
Like, what age are when we
remember our first memories?

00:27:38.147 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well that's a tough question.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I think, one of the
funny things about memory

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.213 align:middle line:90%
is just how malleable it is.

00:27:47.213 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) Happy
birthday to you.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE] Happy
birthday to you.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time I tell you a
story of my personal life,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I loosen its associations
in the brain.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.150 align:middle line:90%
I tell you it.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I re-encode
that information.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all prone
to confabulation.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the story becomes more
and more grandiose over time.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's largely because we
actually re-encode that memory

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:90%
every single time.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing about memory
is that it's not absolute.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's
a lot less accurate

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
than we'd like to believe it is.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fascinating.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense, we're
recreating a memory

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:90%
as we tell it--

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and then, touching it
slightly, photoshopping it,

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and putting it back in--

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:28:38.005 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> --the memories.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very different from how
artificial intelligence systems

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.295 align:middle line:90%
recall data.

00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:47.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, their first birthday.

00:28:47.805 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember how Hossein's
system fetches the metadata?

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Like a date related to an image?

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the emotions
associated with that image?

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.107 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes up with
the so-called memory?

00:28:59.107 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing about the
human brain, however,

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's embodied in a physical
structure with multiple senses.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
remember something,

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
like an episode from
your past, it's not just

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe a picture in
your head, but it

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
may be a smell that's
associated with it.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's an emotion that's
associated with it.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And that triggers a cascade
of events in all these areas

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And that brings this
emergent activity,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:84%
which then we perceive
as to be recollection

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.665 align:middle line:90%
of a scene or a memory.

00:29:29.665 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important way the
brain actually recalls things.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:42.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the olfactory
system, the smell system,

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:84%
has a direct input into
your memory system.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one
of the very unique things

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
about the human brain--
is that your memories are

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:90%
a lived experience.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:90%
They have this richness to it.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
AI systems don't have that
access to that richness.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
They may recall or be
able to classify an input,

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:84%
but certainly not
recall the multi-modal,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.027 align:middle line:84%
the multidimensional information
that you experienced.

00:30:15.027 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the essence
of human cognition.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.185 align:middle line:84%
It's an embodied
cognition, right?

00:30:19.185 --> 00:30:23.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's really
this lived experience.

00:30:23.587 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I get what he's saying.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Computers can't smell,
or taste, or touch.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:84%
A human baby learns and
remembers in all these ways.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So our sensory brains give
us a leg up from the start.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the AI can
replicate the human brain?

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.855 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:43.855 --> 00:30:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Not ever?

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:90%
You never say never, right?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:54.118 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Taufik helped me understand
the complex relationship

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.500 align:middle line:84%
between our brains
and our bodies.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.870 align:middle line:84%
How would we ever replicate
that in a machine?

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember those
360-degree photos?

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris?

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Chris built a
3D model with them.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is some of
the data that's streaming

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:90%
to your avatar.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> He works with Pixomondo,
a visual effects company that

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.009 align:middle line:84%
collaborates with
Hossein's company.

00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:20.735 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is your avatar.

00:31:20.735 --> 00:31:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You've got my beauty
marks and everything.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Ew.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.885 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.535 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to
get way more creepy.

00:31:28.535 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.807 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, I've got great teeth.

00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:32.607 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to--

00:31:32.607 --> 00:31:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's wild.

00:31:33.245 --> 00:31:35.078 align:middle line:84%
>> --get a lot of the
mouth phonetics today.

00:31:35.078 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need
a line from you,

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to sound weird.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The odd toy cow ate
green oat cheese.
