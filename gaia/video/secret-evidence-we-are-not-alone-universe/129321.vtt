00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.865 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I don't think there's any
question today

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that there are secret
governments.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's clear that there has been
an organized effort

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to discredit every aspect of the
UFO phenomenon.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.314 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The UFO cover-up began with
legitimate

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.516 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
national security concerns.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
When you're dealing with
the military,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.055 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
especially in matters
of secrecy,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
the idea is to deceive. 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
(Two, one...) 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's likely that we're going to
find out for sure whether this

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Roswell event happened or not.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.837 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
How on earth would you keep a
secret like that so long?

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Almost 60 years after Roswell,
the mystery of what crashed

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:26.486 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the deserts of New Mexico
remains a secret.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The government's official stance
about the existence of UFOs

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.426 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
has always been denial.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:35.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Eyewitnesses have come and gone.
Project Blue Book,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.831 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the UFO study program of the US
Air Force,

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:42.736 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has gone out of business, but
many questions remain.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Researchers and private
investigators continue to follow

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
every lead in hopes that someday
the truth will be revealed.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Newly leaked classified
government documents

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
may be the first real evidence
to shed light on this

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.153 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
never-ending story.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:03.557 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I decided that instead of
looking at photographs

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:09.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or instead of trying to sort out
new witness testimony,

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that it'd be better to try a
different approach,

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:15.635 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which was the approach of
authenticating documents.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:20.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Dating from the 1940's and
1950's, these documents refer to

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
extraterrestrial contact and the
secret operation established

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.646 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
to investigate this phenomenon.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This project was led by a group
of men appointed by

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
executive order. They operated
under the code-name

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:37.391 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Majestic 12, or simply, MJ12.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:44.431 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If it is true that the United
States government has pursued

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a very aggressive but deeply
clandestine effort

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:56.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to collect and contain
information about UFO phenomena,

00:02:56.777 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
including crashes, military
encounters and whatnot.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.287 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is absolutely essential that
there be documents

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:12.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
about that effort and when I
look at the MJ12 documents,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I say to myself, these are the
kinds of documents a person

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:25.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
would expect to see. This kind
of document has to exist.

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:27.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It is the unanimous opinion of
the members that

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:31.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Operation Majestic 12 be a fully
funded operational top secret

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:35.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
research and development
intelligence gathering agency.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.518 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is also recommended that a
panel of experts be appointed

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:41.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to chair and oversee the
functions and operations

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:44.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of said agency. It's members
should have appropriate

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
security clearances.

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What impresses me most about
these documents

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
is all these checkable details.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.501 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We get so many names to check
out, so many dates

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:55.936 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and so many places.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:59.673 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We'll be at this for the next
couple of years. But, so far,

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it looks impressive that these
things are checking out

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
to be true, real and authentic.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
A major objection to all the
documents is that

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
we don't know who provided them.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.122 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We have to consider, of course,
that whoever did

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was violating the law, and would
be subject to

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
enormous penalties for
photographing

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
classified documents and giving
them to people

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who don't have any authorization
to receive them.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.903 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It began in 1988 when I began
filing

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Freedom of Information Act
requests to the government

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for any information on UFOs.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And in October 1992 I went to
the post office

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I pulled out a Time Magazine
that had a document

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
inserted in it, and I just
thought it was a prank.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.792 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I was working my shift as a
security officer

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
at Pine Knot Landing. An old
gentleman came to the gate,

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and he said well, I'm Thomas
Cantwheel. He told me

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:00.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
he was in the Army's
Counterintelligence

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:05.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit
since 1942 and had been involved

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:11.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the UFO program almost into
the 1980s.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.146 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And he just wanted to let me
know he was real.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.848 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
To tell me everything, get it
off his chest

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:19.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because he didn't think he had
much longer to live.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.523 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The IPU stands for the
Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit,

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and this is rumored to have been
a unit within the Army,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.431 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
late 40's, early 50's. Some
people link the late

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Douglas MacArthur with this
group, that they were involved

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.236 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in some kind of early UFO
investigation.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
My father himself had been
involved in the

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
United States Air Force's UFO
program for several years.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I also learned after my father's
death

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
by going through his papers that
he was awarded

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the Air Force Commendation Medal
and was given a special citation

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:59.392 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
by order of General Lemay for
his outstanding work in the

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.495 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
United States Air Force UFO
program.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:06.066 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's very clear to me that UFOs
are real.

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.134 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The data that we have in hand
establishes that

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
beyond a shadow of a doubt to my
mind,

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and that some of them,
certainly, are...

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:15.942 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it involved observations of
alien spacecraft.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:18.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is a completely independent
question from whether or not the

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:22.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
MJ12 documents are real
themselves and are valid.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I had no interest or beliefs in
UFOs, and I never considered

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.956 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
giving any thought to the
phenomenon itself.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:32.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But when your own father tells
you they're real, and that the

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:36.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Air Force considered them very

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:38.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
threatening to the

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:42.102 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
United States Air Force, then I
began to have a

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:43.903 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
different attitude.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:49.542 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The documents that Tim Cooper
had were really very extensive.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:52.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There were 100 pages, 50,000
words.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:57.183 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The things that they talk about,
however, are stunning.

00:06:57.183 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A consensus reached by members
of the panel that until

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:03.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
positive proof that the Russians
did not attempt

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a series of reconnaissance
flights over our most

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.928 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
secure installations, the
sightings and recovered objects

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.499 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
are interplanetary in nature.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.101 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Buried in one of these MJ12
documents is

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
the White Hot Report.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It is a reference to a discovery
in 1941.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.476 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This alludes to the possibility
that a UFO crashed in the

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:27.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
United States six years before
the Roswell event.

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I originally read the first
account, at least that

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I'm aware, the only real account
of the Cape Girardeau 1941

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
crash retrieval event in Leonard
Stringfield's 1991 volume about

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.996 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
crashed saucers. And I didn't
think a lot about it

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:47.667 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
until one of these newer MJ12
documents mentioned the crash

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:51.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in Missouri, and I decided I was
going to find Charlette Mann.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:56.776 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Grandfather had been called out
that someone had called in

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.713 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that there had been a plane
crash outside of town,

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:02.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and would he be willing to go to
minister to people there,

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:03.917 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
which he did.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Upon arriving, it was a very
different situation. It was not,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not a conventional aircraft as
we know it.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There were three entities or
non-human people there.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Two were just outside the saucer
and the third one was

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:37.083 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
further out. His understanding
was that perhaps that third one

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:40.854 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
was not dead on impact.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So father did pray over them,
give them last rites.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.902 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Not long after they arrived
military just showed up,

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
surrounded the area.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Grandfather didn't know what was
said to the others, but

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:07.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
he was told, this didn't happen,
you didn't see this,

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:12.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
this is national security. It is
never to be talked about again.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The year following the Cape
Girardeau Report,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Los Angeles was the site of more
UFO activity.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:30.303 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The LA air raid allegedly
produced two more

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:35.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
downed saucers, one just off the
coast of California.

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The Army Air Corps also
recovered a similar object

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:44.684 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the San Bernardino Mountains
east of Los Angeles,

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:48.421 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which cannot be identified as
conventional aircraft.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This headquarters has come to a
determination

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that the mystery airplanes are
in fact 'not Earthly',

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and according to secret
intelligence sources,

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:59.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they are in all probability of
interplanetary origin.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:05.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
With the United States at war it
appears that President Roosevelt

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.042 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
saw this interplanetary
phenomenon not as a threat,

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.678 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
but as a great opportunity.

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I have considered the
disposition of the material

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in possession of the Army that
may be of great significance

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
toward the development of a
super weapon of war.

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:25.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A new super weapon was developed
to win the war.

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:30.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It was tested in remote areas of
New Mexico and Nevada.

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:34.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer led the
top secret Manhattan Project

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.504 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that would change the world
forever.

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:42.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This time, Ron, the stakes are
kind of high.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:45.645 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's going to work all right,
Robert, and I'm sure

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:50.416 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we'll never be sorry for it.
Well, we'll know in 40 seconds.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As the atom bomb experiments
continued,

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:05.899 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so did the sightings of UFOs.
Many believe that

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:09.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it was this nuclear testing that
actually drew these

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:12.405 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
mysterious objects to the area.

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:15.808 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The government's first official
UFO program study

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:20.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
showed that UFOs were very
interested in things atomic,

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:25.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
things that generated Plutonium.
And our documents

00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:28.354 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
also show that. Specifically,
there's one case where

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:32.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
they talk about a crash site
just a half a mile from

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the Trinity site, which is the
first atomic test on the planet.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.404 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is the gallant crew that
rode the big super-fort

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which carried the first atomic
bomb to Japan. Piloted by

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.677 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Colonel Paul Tibbits Jr. of
Miami, carrying

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:53.813 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Navy Captain William Parsons of
Chicago, who helped design

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the bomb, as observer. And Major
Thomas Ferebee of

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Knoxville, North Carolina, who
pulled the plug on Hiroshima.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The B29 dropped it's load of
atomic death

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which exploded with a force
equal to 20,000 tons of TNT.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.664 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When the bomb was dropped on
Japan in 1945, the war ended,

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:17.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but the UFO activity did not. In
June of 1947, physicist

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Albert Einstein and nuclear
scientist Robert Oppenheimer

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
drafted a report offering their
opinions on how to deal

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with extraterrestrial biological
entities,

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:29.849 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
if they did indeed exist.

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.285 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is difficult to predict what
the attitude of

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:35.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
international law will be with
regard to the occupation

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:39.859 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
by celestial peoples of certain
locations on our planet,

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:43.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but the only thing that can be
foreseen is that there will be a

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:46.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
profound change in traditional
concepts.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Headline Edition July 8th, 1947.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Army Air Forces has
announced that a flying disk

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:56.175 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has been found, and is now in
the possession of the Army.

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:58.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Army officers say the missile,
found sometime last week,

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:01.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
has been inspected at Roswell,
New Mexico,

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:04.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and sent to Wright Field, Ohio
for further inspection.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:08.087 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When news of a crashed saucer
near Roswell, New Mexico

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:10.723 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
hit the airwaves, the government
was ready.

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:13.726 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The saucer quickly became a
downed weather balloon,

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:17.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the policy of evasion became
the order of the day.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It would last for decades.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I think the US Air Force
explanation that Mogul balloon

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.607 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is what crashed at Roswell is
just specious.

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:30.243 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
First of all, the timing is
wrong.

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:32.345 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
The technologies are wrong.

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:35.381 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Certainly pieces of a Mogul
balloon or the sensor

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
systems attached thereto would
have been identifiable.

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.421 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And they aren't. I believe that
these kinds of answers

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:44.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
actually do a disservice both to
the American people

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:46.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and to the Air Force itself.

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:51.497 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:56.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Air Force interest in this
problem has been due to our

00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:01.674 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
feeling of an obligation to
identify and analyze

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to the best of our ability
anything in the air

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:08.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that may have the possibility of
threat or menace to

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:12.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the United States. In pursuit of
this obligation,

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:16.989 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
since 1947 we have received and
analyzed between

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.826 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
one and two thousand reports.

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We've been able to explain them
as hoaxes, as erroneously

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
identified friendly aircraft, as
meteorological or

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:33.539 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
electronic phenomena, or as
light aberrations.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.742 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
With all due respect to the Air
Force, I believe that

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:38.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
some of them will prove to be of
interplanetary origin.

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
During a three year
investigation I have found that

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
many pilots have described
objects of substance

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and high speed. One case, pilots
reported their plane was

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.722 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
buffeted by an object which
passed them at

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
500 miles an hour. Obviously
this was a solid object,

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:55.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that I believe it was from outer
space.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:15:01.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I am certain that there have
been several recoveries

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:05.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of alien craft and bodies in the
United States.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:10.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm using the word 'several'
advisedly,

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:12.845 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that it could be very
conservative.

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:16.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Roswell was not the first
incident. My feeling is that

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Missouri incident in 1941,
as related by

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.223 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the Reverend William Huffman to
his granddaughter

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:26.392 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
did indeed occur.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:30.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I believe there's a coverup on
the UFO subject because

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so many different things point
to it.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Clear, well-documented reports
from credible witnesses,

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:45.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a lot of documentary information
from the archives,

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:50.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a pattern of denial from the
government that

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:56.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
looks almost silly, a pattern of
denial from scientists

00:15:56.422 --> 00:16:03.729 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that is clearly informed not by
facts, but by some kind,

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:07.466 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I would say an indirect kind of
intimidation.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The reason I feel the Air Force
and the government in general

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is trying to destroy my father
is so that they can destroy

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the Roswell event. That must
mean that

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:20.179 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
there really is something there
that they have to hide,

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.182 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that this must be kept from the
public at all costs.

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:25.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
When you're dealing with the
military,

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
especially in matters of
secrecy, the idea is to deceive.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:36.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There is a manual you well know,
that MJ12, which also states to

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
discourage witnesses, to put out
false statements

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to protect the secrecy of this
1947 event.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:48.541 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
One of the first documents that
I got was entitled,

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:51.077 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Extraterrestrial Entities and
Technology.

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Recovery and Disposal. The
content of this

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
special operation manual is
really quite stunning.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It explains why it's so
important to keep it secret,

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:03.122 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and how they go about the
process. How they keep

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the public in the dark, what
lies they tell them,

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
what deceptive statements...

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:10.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Great care must be taken to
preserve the security of any

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.999 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
location where extraterrestrial
technology might be

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
retrievable for scientific
study.

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.841 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The most desirable response
would be that

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:24.477 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
nothing unusual has occurred.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:29.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It may become necessary to issue
false statements

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.319 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to preserve the security of the
site.

00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:38.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We continue to study the special
operations manual and

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:42.862 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
look at each aspect of it and
try to determine

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.597 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
the authenticity of it.

00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:48.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Subtleties like the use of the
term, Central Intelligence

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:53.005 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
instead of Central Intelligence
Agency show a subtle amount of

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:57.443 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
arrogance that is indicative of
the Central Intelligence Agency

00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:02.748 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in 1954. The 32 page special
operations manual also includes

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:06.385 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the Extraterrestrial Technology
Classification Table.

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:10.423 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It details procedures for
retrieval of crashed saucers,

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:16.662 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
how to handle organic matter,
and where to ship the bodies.

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:20.466 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The Blue Lab at Wright Field in
Ohio was the secret destination

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:24.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for some of this material. A
young woman named June Crain

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
worked in a classified office at
the base.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Shortly before she died, she
told her story.

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:36.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I started at Wright-Patterson in
'42. I was 18 years old,

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:39.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and all of the people I worked
with were older than me.

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So I'm probably the last
surviver of my lab group,

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and probably the last one still
around to talk about it.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:53.032 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I had a Q clearance, I worked
with scientists and with

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:56.535 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
engineers. I knew a man named
Clarence Smith,

00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:00.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
he was a master Sergeant. He
came in one day

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:04.877 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
before we started to work, very
upset.

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Clarence told us that his plane
brought back two bodies

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:13.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in crates from New Mexico. When
I asked which plane had crashed,

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
he said, it wasn't a plane, it
was a flying saucer.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:23.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Well, they knew of three crashes
that I was aware of by 1952,

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
maybe there were more. In '52
there was a crash cover-up.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Roswell was in '47. That balloon
story was a damn lie then,

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:36.308 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and it's still a lie.

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.678 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When I interviewed June, I
realized that I was getting a

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:43.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
rare glimpse into another period
of time that was

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:47.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
right at the heart of the
mystery of ufology.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:51.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I began to understand the full
extent of the cover-up.

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:54.927 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The difference between what was
commonly known to engineers and

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:58.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
scientists, and what is probably
still known to this day,

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and what has been revealed to
the public.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.671 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
An officer showed me a piece of
metal. I think that it was

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:08.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Lieutenant Rose. He was one of
those guys in the office

00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:12.645 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who liked to talk to me.
Lieutenant Rose asked me to

00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:17.817 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
break it up, tear it apart if I
could. He handed me the

00:20:17.817 --> 00:20:24.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
scissors. I couldn't dent it or
cut it. I asked him what it was,

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:27.793 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and where it came from. He said
that it was

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:30.262 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
a piece of a spaceship.

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:32.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
According to the special
operations manual,

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the physical evidence from the
crash was to be

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:38.971 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
collected and transported to an
undisclosed location for study.

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.642 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That location appears to have
been the mysterious Area 51.

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:47.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I'm satisfied and very pleased
that there is good reason to say

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:50.549 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that Area 51 was created in the
early '50's.

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:54.753 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now we have that reason. We
didn't have that reason before.

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.324 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Skeptics have claimed that Area
51 did not exist when the

00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:01.894 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
special operations manual was
published in 1954,

00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:05.764 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but according to this Las Vegas
newspaper, a huge government

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.634 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
installation began construction
in the Nevada desert

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:13.606 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in early 1951. The project was
cloaked in a security blackout,

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:18.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and has remained so to this day.
Many believe it is where the

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:22.047 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
technology of these alien craft
is being studied.

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It causes one to ask the
question,

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:27.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I don't know the answer, but
to ask the question

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:30.222 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of to what extent might we have
been successful

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in reverse engineering some of
the discoveries

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
from crashed flying saucers.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now that the sound barrier has
been cracked, the thermal, or

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:41.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
heat barrier, is the goal of the
experimental X2 rocket plane.

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:44.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The stainless steel bullet
designed to stand speeds

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:47.439 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of more than 2000 miles an hour
is released.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:50.342 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
On these tests the rocket plane
is not fueled,

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:53.245 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but in future rounds, when it
attains maximum velocity,

00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:55.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
heat developed by friction may
reach more than

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:58.784 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a thousand degrees. Here, the
ability of metal and alloys

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to withstand the heat are
expected to provide

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.823 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
valuable data for projected
spaceships and satellites.

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.359 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The slim metal ship may furnish
some of the answers

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:11.263 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as the world enters the space
age.

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Atomic Energy Commission and
Nuclear Energy

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:16.302 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Propulsion of Aircraft are
currently conducting research

00:22:16.302 --> 00:22:19.772 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for advanced technologies and
atomic engines and

00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:21.941 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
radical propulsion studies.

00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Integration of hydrogen-based
fuels and electro-hydrodynamic

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
technology may open up for us
development of super-aerodynes

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:32.351 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
with mach 5 capabilities.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:36.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Some of the technology, yes,
they have improved on

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:39.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or discovered, and is being used
today.

00:22:39.158 --> 00:22:42.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Yeah, I think everything that we
were involved in

00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:49.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from 1942 clear up to 1947 was
justified.

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:58.877 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Just weeks after the crashes at
Roswell, President Harry Truman

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:02.982 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
named James V. Forrestal as the
first Secretary of Defense.

00:23:02.982 --> 00:23:07.753 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
On September 24th, 1947, a top
secret research and development

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:11.056 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
operation was established under
his direction.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It was called Majestic 12.

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:19.298 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's my understanding that MJ12
was basically a sort of

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:23.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
oversight, administrative,
policy-making group. Very small.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:27.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And that the people who were
responsible to MJ12

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were very select people in
various branches

00:23:29.642 --> 00:23:32.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the intelligence community,
the military,

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:35.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and military department. So it
was very compartmented,

00:23:35.848 --> 00:23:37.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it wasn't some huge operation.

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
MJ12 supervised several agencies
involved in various aspects

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.724 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the UFO phenomenon. But only
the 12 Majestic members

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:49.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
knew the whole story, and they
reported only to the President

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:53.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
on a need to know basis.

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
One of the reasons that there
are so few leaks

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is that 9 out of 10 people are
loyal Americans when they sign

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:06.278 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the security oath, and they are
rigorously defending

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
what they've agreed to, namely
they're

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
not going to tell anybody.

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:12.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so therefore, really, only
one out of a thousand persons

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:16.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
ever gets close to leaking the
story.

00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:19.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
One of the most stunning
documents that arrived

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.528 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in Tim Cooper's mailbox was the
First Annual Report

00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the Majestic 12 operation.
And this was a primary report,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and then three annexes
comprising 17 pages.

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:38.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Many unusual commentaries were
included, everything from

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:43.282 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
missing soldiers to airplanes
that have been shot down

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:47.419 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
while chasing UFOs. There's a
section called

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:50.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Government Policy of Control and
Denial.

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:53.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
One of the most difficult
aspects of controlling the

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
perception in the public's mind
of government attempts of denial

00:24:56.995 --> 00:25:03.235 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and ignorance is actual control
of the press.

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:06.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
People asked, how on earth would
you keep a secret like that

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:11.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
so long? And the way they did it
was to begin with the security

00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:13.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
procedures that we developed
during the

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:17.783 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Manhattan Engineering Project
for the first atomic bomb.

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:21.253 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Compartmentalization, to tell
each group only a little bit

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the story so hardly anybody
has the big picture.

00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And then of course security
tests, security oaths, fines,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and ultimately threats.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There's a section called
Constitutional and

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:35.434 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Domestic Issues, and it
states...

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:40.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In dealing with clear violations
of civic law and guarantees

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:43.375 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
as defined under the
constitution, it has been

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
discussed among members of
Majestic 12 that such protection

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:49.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of individual rights are
outweighed

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:52.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
by the nature of the threat.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:56.989 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Clearly they thought that ETs
landing or being involved

00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:59.458 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the American citizenry was
so important

00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:04.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that they would
control, capture, and manage

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:07.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
every aspect
of that interaction.

00:26:07.266 --> 00:26:11.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's a very interesting group of
people. Six civilian,

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:15.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
six military, 2 Air Force, 2
Army, 2 Navy.

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:18.977 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And some of them were very well
known, but some of them

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:20.312 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
weren't very well known, 
but turned out to be

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
perfectly appropriate.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
As President-Elect Dwight
Eisenhower was preparing to take

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:28.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
office, he was briefed about the
ongoing UFO investigations

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:30.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of this elite group.

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:33.959 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I believe the Eisenhower
briefing document is genuine.

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The list of members. I thought
that would indicate it was phony

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.131 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because Dr. Donald Menzel, a
Harvard University

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Professor of Astronomy was
listed as a member.

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:45.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But he was a total skeptic. He
wrote three anti-UFO books.

00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:46.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You certainly don't need a
security clearance

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:48.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to teach astronomy at Harvard.

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:52.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
First of all the objects are not
unidentified.

00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:56.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We know what they are. Second,
in many cases, in most cases,

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:59.251 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
are not flying. And finally, in
many cases

00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:01.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they are not even material
objects.

00:27:01.487 --> 00:27:04.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I discovered to my total
amazement that he led a

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:07.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
double life, that he worked with
the National Security Agency,

00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:10.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
he worked with the CIA, he had a
top-secret ultra clearance,

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:12.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
did classified work for 30
companies.

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:14.466 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
None of this was known.

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:17.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
By the time Eisenhower read this
above-top-secret document,

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:22.441 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the founder of the Majestic 12,
James Forrestal, was dead.

00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:26.712 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In March of 1949, he was
diagnosed with depression

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:30.415 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and ordered to the Bethesda
Naval Hospital.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:33.852 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He was isolated, and feared for
his life.

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:38.624 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
On May 22nd, his body was found
below his hospital window.

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:42.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His death was ruled a suicide,
but this CIA memo

00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:46.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
tells a different story.

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:49.902 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The untimely death of Secretary
Forrestal was deemed necessary

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:53.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
and regrettable.

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:56.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If it should ever be possible to
prove

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:59.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that the documents are true,

00:27:59.578 --> 00:28:03.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
then obviously they indicate a
very,

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:07.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
very different history than we
thought. They indicate

00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:12.391 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
layers of government we don't
know exist. They indicate

00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:15.928 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
procedures of government that
seem anti-constitutional.

00:28:15.928 --> 00:28:20.832 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They paint a picture of a world
that is wildly different

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:24.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
than the average person expects.
And of course also,

00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:28.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a world in which there are
aliens flying around and being

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
captured and studied by
government forces.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.779 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It's a very odd picture indeed.

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I am convinced, based upon the
evidence that's building up,

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:44.656 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that something very strange has
happened, that the number of

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:49.828 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sightings of all types are just
out of all proportion to

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:53.832 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
something that... If it's not
real, there's something

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.969 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
very, very strange going on. So
it is a preponderance of

00:28:56.969 --> 00:29:00.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
evidence, it is the old-timers
coming forward,

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:06.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it is the documents that Bob and
Ryan Wood are putting together

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that, with powerful forensic
research, make a

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:13.051 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
very, very powerful case that's
hard to ignore.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:16.288 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
We have selected the techniques

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that questioned-document
examiners use, 

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:21.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we have hired some
questioned-document examiners,

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:23.328 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and those techniques are very
powerful because

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
they permit a judge in a
courtroom to tell the difference

00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:29.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
between a genuine document and a
fake document.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:33.505 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The degrees of authenticity can
be determined by comparison of

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:37.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the specialized stamps, file
numbers, date formats,

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:41.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
line spacing, and paragraphing
with known authentic archival

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:45.183 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
documents. File markings are
often particularly telling.

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:49.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Some of the documents have
misspelled words.

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Does this mean they're frauds?
We don't think so.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
These originals are probably
rough drafts, which would have

00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:56.094 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
typos and temporary spellings

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:58.864 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
until the final draft was
complete.

00:29:58.864 --> 00:30:02.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
e of the things that questioned-
document examiners do

00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:05.671 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to authenticate documents is to
look at the type.

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:10.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so when you study the
typography and become familiar

00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:13.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with how the hot lead printing
presses of that era work,

00:30:13.512 --> 00:30:16.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you find that once every so
often there was a letter 'z'

00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that was raised because it was
not commonly used.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We've found a document from that
era that shows a raised 'z',

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:26.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and we have in our own document
about every third 'z' is raised.

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:28.694 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is just exactly the kind of
thing that

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:31.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
telegraphs authenticity.

00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:36.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you're talking about leaked
documents, the provenance of

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:40.138 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
leaked documents, we need to
know where they've come from,

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:43.608 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we need to see the originals.
And one has to admit

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:49.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that, in 99 percent of cases, we
do not see the originals.

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have several documents that
are original pages.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
These permit testing that cannot
be done with copies.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For example, we can date a
document by analyzing its ink.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.594 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A small sample is punched out
leaving a pinhole in the paper.

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:06.298 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The ink is then dissolved, and
by using liquid chromatography,

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:09.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the colors are compared with a
standard library of inks.

00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:13.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The imprint made by the
individual typewriter keys can

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:17.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
be used to compare with a
library of typewriter fonts.

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:21.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The watermark on the paper can
often be found and dated.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Sometimes we can even see
through the blacked-out areas

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and decipher the hidden words.

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:40.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
During the authentication
process of the

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:44.836 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Eisenhower briefing document,
Stan Friedman went to

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:48.373 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the National Archives, and in
the presence of an archivist

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:52.711 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
found in their files what's
known as

00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:56.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Cutler-Twining Memo, which
mentions MJ12-

00:31:56.314 --> 00:32:02.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
MJ12 Special Studies group. We
have an original onion skin

00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:04.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
paper with the appropriate
watermarks,

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:08.293 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
original declassification
markings. It is a hard,

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:14.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
physical, testable piece of
paper. It's in a secure facility

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
at our national archives in
College Park, Maryland.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This declassified document seems
to provide proof

00:32:21.173 --> 00:32:24.643 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that MJ12 was a reality, even
though the government

00:32:24.643 --> 00:32:27.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
has never acknowledged its
existence.

00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:33.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
 after you use these questioned-
document techniques

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:38.456 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to the best of your ability, it
turns out that

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:43.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the documents almost speak for
themselves as being genuine.

00:32:49.501 --> 00:32:52.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If the Majestic documents are
real, they provide new insight

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.607 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
into perhaps the most closely
guarded secret in the history

00:32:55.607 --> 00:32:59.277 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the world. A secret that has
been fiercely protected

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:01.913 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
for a very long time.

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:05.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I think that government secrecy,
classifying this information

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
at what amounts to an
above-top-secret level

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:13.992 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
was absolutely warranted in
1947, and maybe earlier,

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:16.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because I think all this
business got started

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:19.998 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
perhaps during the Second World
War.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:23.501 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is the recommendation of the
President's Special Panel

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with concurrence from Majestic
12 that a policy of

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:29.875 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
strict denial of the events
surfacing from Roswell,

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
New Mexico, and any other
incident of such caliber,

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:37.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
be enforced. An interactive
program of controlled releases

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:41.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to the media, in such fashion to
discredit any civilian

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
investigation be instituted in
accordance with the provisions

00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:49.261 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the 1947 National Security
Act.

00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:53.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Certainly in 1947 the government
could not afford to

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:55.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
tell the world. They could not
afford to say, look

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:59.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there are these alien spacecraft
penetrating our airspace.

00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:01.406 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We don't know where they're
from, what they want or

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:02.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
how they operate, but we thought
you'd like to know.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That would have been totally
irresponsible.

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:07.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There's no question it was
justified at the time,

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:09.714 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
until they had answers.

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:14.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I think it's quite possible that
much secrecy is due to the fact

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:18.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that the authorities do not have
all the answers.

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That they cannot be certain from
a day to day basis,

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:25.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or even a year to year basis, or
whatever, as to precisely

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:28.466 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
what is going on.

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:31.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
By the mid 1960's the
government's apparent interest

00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:34.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in UFOs was waning. But a rash
of new sightings of

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:38.376 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
unexplained lights and moving
objects reignited the debate.

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We are being observed by some
type of device

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.422 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which is ahead of us, far ahead
of us, and is probably

00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:54.826 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
controlled by a highly advanced
superior civilization.

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:58.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now this is a conclusion which I
personally have stated,

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:01.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and is shared by some members of
our board of governors

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:03.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and advisors. Not all of them.

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:09.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But it has reached a point where
many people in the Air Force

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
have the same conclusion. In
fact, the Air Force

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:13.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
at one time had a top-secret
estimate that

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
these things were interplanetary
spaceships.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.384 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Based on what is known of the
technology and intelligence

00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the visitors, it is fairly
certain that there will be

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
other sightings and encounters
of a spectacular nature.

00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:29.828 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
As to the purpose and modus
operandi, we are not certain,

00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:33.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but it is clear that if these
visitors had conquest in mind,

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:37.102 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it would not be difficult for
them given their ability to

00:35:37.102 --> 00:35:40.372 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
penetrate our airspace at will.

00:35:40.372 --> 00:35:44.576 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I think that now it's evolved
into of a more multilayered

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
problem, part of it dealing with
the high technology projects and

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.416 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
keeping them secure. If they
tell the public a few things,

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:54.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there would be a clamor for more
information that might

00:35:54.052 --> 00:35:57.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
jeopardize the security of these
programs.

00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:00.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Another problem is that the fact
that they've covered it up

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:04.829 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so long would create a sort of
backlash against the government

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:07.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and the intelligence
establishment.

00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:14.973 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If these documents show a long,
systematic, highly articulated

00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:19.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
process for handling UFO-related
information,

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:21.679 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
for sequestering that
information, for

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
marshaling it here and there,
and for keeping everybody else

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:30.989 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
out of the loop, completely
unaware, the structure

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that caused that to occur is a
phenomenon in world history.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I think the MJ12 documents are
extraordinarily important,

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:44.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
probably the most important
government documents ever leaked

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:48.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to the public, because they make
clear, if they're genuine,

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:53.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that the United States has known
that aliens are visiting Earth,

00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:57.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that they are not perfect,
obviously, at least one crashed,

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and we have been taking measures
to try to learn as much as we

00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:03.922 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
could from the wreckage, and to
try to understand

00:37:03.922 --> 00:37:05.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
what's going on.

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Why on earth would they have
kept it secret,

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.727 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the discovery of
extraterrestrial life,

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.363 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the greatest discovery in the
history of man?

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:15.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The main reason, of course, is
still a valid reason today,

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and that is to make sure that
our enemies, namely in those

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.139 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
days, the Soviet Union, did not
get the technology.

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:24.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The technology was the driver.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:26.511 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In addition, the reason for
keeping it a secret is

00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to not let the public know that
we really

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
couldn't control our airspace.

00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:37.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
With urgent speed, the jet
fighters rush to get in the air.

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:40.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Every second counts. They must
be able to intercept the mystery

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:45.497 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
plane before it can reach a
target and drop its bomb.

00:37:45.497 --> 00:37:48.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
One example of technology
discussed in the documents

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:52.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is a report, an analytical
report from the research and

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:56.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
development laboratory dated 2
September, 1947,

00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:59.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
where it has an early
description of fiber-optics,

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:01.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
in essence, and it says...

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.848 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Flight instruments and controls
are activated by optical wave

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:08.286 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
guide fibers similar to glass
rods except they are flexible

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:10.588 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and have a plastic cladding
wrap.

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:14.626 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This cladding wrap is sort of
the key breakthrough

00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:17.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in fiber optics, that allows
increased signal to noise.

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:21.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now, here, this is a guy talking
and describing fiber optics

00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:23.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
in 1947.

00:38:23.201 --> 00:38:27.772 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
One of the documents that was
particularly exciting is a

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:30.608 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
document that was done at the
end of December of 1947,

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
prepared and approved by

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:34.212 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Lieutenant General Nathan
Twining.

00:38:34.212 --> 00:38:37.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This included the results of
what our scientists and

00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:40.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
engineers had been able to
evaluate and determine

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:44.622 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
during the summer. And one of
the things that really strike

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:48.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
me is the description that talks
about a series of fine grid-like

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:53.131 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
lines connecting a series of
dots in pure silver.

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:55.066 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This is very close to a
description of an

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:58.069 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
integrated circuit today.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.672 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
One interesting thing about the
craft itself,

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:05.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it carried no fuel. There was no
fuel. It was...

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.147 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they assume that it was
propelled by a series of cells,

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:12.951 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
octagon-shaped cells underneath
the craft itself,

00:39:12.951 --> 00:39:16.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which indicates that evidently
they were grafting energy from

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:20.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the atmosphere, someway. That is
one of the areas that they

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:23.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
haven't discovered, or haven't
found out yet.

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:28.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
As far as this idea of reverse
engineering a crashed or

00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:33.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
captured spacecraft, I would
hope that's been done.

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:36.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I'd hate to think that something
has been sitting there

00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:40.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
longer than the lifetime of most
of the people who will see this

00:39:40.245 --> 00:39:43.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
program, and nothing's been done
to it.

00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:46.317 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The potential for learning is
astounding,

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:49.654 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and not attempting to reverse
engineer it would be

00:39:49.654 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
unthinkable.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:56.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The YB49 flying wing makes its
maiden flight.

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:07.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is the shape of things to
come.

00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:09.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What if in the last five years
we've developed new techniques

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:12.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
for monitoring vehicles in the
sky?

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.379 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We've got stealth aircraft,
maybe the other guy'll have

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
stealth aircraft. Should that be
made public? And if we use those

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
techniques to monitor flying
saucers,

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
should that be made public?

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Should the secrecy continue now?

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:31.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I've never been an advocate for
putting everything on the table,

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:34.966 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
especially technology. I have
mixed feelings about

00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:38.102 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
what the government should do
about covering-up the truth

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about flying saucers. I would
like the government to stand up,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.611 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
take away the ridicule that's
been heaped on a lot of people.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:50.148 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, a government announcement
would bring forth

00:40:50.148 --> 00:40:53.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a tremendous amount of data.

00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:56.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Are these documents authentic,
and is their narrative real?

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:59.223 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I believe that there are four
possibilities.

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:04.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
One, of course, is that they are
frauds created as a hoax

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:10.268 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
by a gifted amateur. The second
possibility is that they are

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:14.339 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
officially constructed
disinformation, perhaps

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:18.676 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
created decades ago for the
purposes of cold war

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:22.580 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
misinformation for some kind of
geopolitical purpose.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.517 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The third possibility is that
the narrative is a mixture of

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:29.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
fact and fiction. And then the
fourth possibility, of course,

00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:33.224 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
is that they are authentic,
genuine leaked documents

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:35.827 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that describe some remarkable
events

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:38.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
concealed from the history
books.

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:47.305 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The concept that we are not
alone in the universe

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:51.409 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has captivated many since the
beginning of mankind.

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:54.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Throughout history, artists have
included flying objects in their

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:58.182 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
paintings, like this one from
17th century painter and

00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:01.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
protege of Rembrandt, Arent de
Gelder.

00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:06.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Today, believers outnumber
skeptics 3:2.

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:11.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
People around the world continue
to report UFO sightings,

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:16.567 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but proof of extraterrestrial
contact remains elusive.

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:20.872 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If the MJ12 documents are
genuine, the story they tell is

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:25.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
astounding. If and when this
story is brought to light,

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:30.381 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
what impact will it have on our
destiny?

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:34.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Philosophically speaking, I have
to say that we're moving rapidly

00:42:34.419 --> 00:42:36.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
into a different kind of world
in which

00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:40.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the possibility of life from
elsewhere is

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:44.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
increasingly non-alarming.

00:42:44.162 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Our space exploration is
bringing us to the point

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where we're ready to explore the
outer planets,

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:51.035 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and probably within a century

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:57.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
go outside of our solar system
altogether.

00:42:57.642 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So it's time that all of it is
exposed for the sake of science,

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for the sake of the stability of
our government,

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:08.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for the sake of civilization
itself.

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:11.022 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I've steeped myself in flying
saucer information

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:12.690 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
for more than 40 years.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I've worked on classified
government sponsored programs.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's clear that there has been
an organized effort to discredit

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:23.201 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
every aspect of the UFO
phenomenon.

00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:26.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
These documents are no
exception. If they're genuine,

00:43:26.504 --> 00:43:29.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they are of extraordinary
importance for all of mankind.

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:34.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If, in fact, we have recovered
an extraterrestrial spacecraft

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
sometime in the past 50 years,
then of course we are in

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:44.222 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
possession of definitive
evidence that we are not alone.

00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:48.192 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
One of my heros in life, Carl
Sagan, was fond of saying,

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:51.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on the day that we do discover
that we are not alone,

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:54.265 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
our society may begin to evolve
and transform in some

00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:57.335 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
incredible and wondrous new
ways. And that's

00:43:57.335 --> 00:43:59.904 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a day to look forward to, I
believe.
