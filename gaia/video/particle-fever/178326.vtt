The kinds of answers that this
theory gives to these questions

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
seems so patently absurd that
we think that we're missing

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:90%
something very, very big.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And on top of all of that,
there is one prediction

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
of this theory
absolutely crucial

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
for it to even make
internal theoretical sense.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
famous Higgs particle.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs or something
like it must show up.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't show up,
there's something truly,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
deeply wrong, very, very
deeply wrong with the way

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.404 align:middle line:90%
we think about physics.

00:11:32.404 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
There are strong reasons
to think that at least some

of these questions will
find answers at the LHC.

I was a very young
undergraduate student.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
time I entered the site,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I was a bit scared by the
corridors then in the CERN

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.409 align:middle line:84%
So I was almost lost
in those corridors.

For me, it has been a
wonderful experience,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:10%

of being involved right

and experimentalists.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
When I started
college, I absolutely

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:90%
did not want to do physics.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Physics meant to me
everything that was boring.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Textbook, theories, proofs.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But then I discovered
the experimental side.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And the experimental side
is the hands-on aspect.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about taking a theory which
is abstract and making it real.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:84%
How do you build an experiment
to discover something

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that the theory predicts?

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:90%

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when constructing
the whole thing,

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
we several times thought,
what if the whole thing just

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:90%
does not work?

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
now this will work.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing is, will
we ever find something?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we will just
find nothing new.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It would be a
catastrophe for physics.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.472 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, none of
the open questions

00:14:35.472 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
which we have at the moment
would have been answered.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:10%
>> So the team is basically
the most fundamental

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like what any child
would design as an experiment.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
You take two things, and
you smash them together.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And you get a lot of stuff that
comes out of that collision,

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and you try to
understand that stuff.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this case, what
we're smashing together

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is tiny protons which are
inside the center of every atom.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get them
going as fast as possible,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
we have to build this
huge 17-mile ring.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And we run those
protons around the ring

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
multiple times to
build up speed,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:90%
almost to the speed of light.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we collide two beams
going in opposite directions

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:90%
at four points.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And at those four points are
four different experiments,

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
ATLAS, LHCb, CMS, and ALICE.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, I work on the
ATLAS experiment.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And ATLAS is like a
huge seven-story camera

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that takes a snapshot of
every single collision.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's billions
of collisions.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And the hope is that we'll see
the very famous Higgs particle.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But every time we've turned on
a new accelerator at a higher

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
energy, we've always
been surprised.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.694 align:middle line:84%
So the real hope is that
we'll see the Higgs,

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
but that there's also
something amazingly new.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:10%
We actually have two answers.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.234 align:middle line:84%
One answer is what
we tell people,

00:16:26.234 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and the other
answer is the truth.

[LAUGHTER]

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you both.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing incorrect
about the first answer.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's not the
thing that drives us.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not how we think about it.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
you can say quickly,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and the person you're talking
to won't get diverted, or pass

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
out, or pick up the
SkyMall catalog,

Answer number one,
we are reproducing

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
the physics, the conditions
just after the Big Bang.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it in this
collider, and we're

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
reproducing that so we can
see what it was like when

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:90%
the universe just started.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:90%
This is what we tell people.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, answer two.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to understand
the basic laws of nature.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:84%
It sounds slightly more
mild, but this is really

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
where we are, and what
we're trying to do.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We study particles because
just after the Big Bang,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:90%
all there was was particles.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And they carry the information
about how our universe started

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and how it got to be the
way it is, and its future.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning
of the 1900s, it

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
became clear that all known
matter, everything that we

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:90%
know about, is made of atoms.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that atoms are made of just
three particles, the electron,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.235 align:middle line:90%
the proton, and the neutron.

00:17:52.235 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
In the '30s, other
particles were discovered.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the 1960s,
there were hundreds

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of new particles with a new
particle discovered every week.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And there was mass confusion.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Until a number of
theorists realized

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was a simple
mathematical structure

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:90%
that explained all of this.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
That most of these particles
were made of the same three

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:90%
little bits we call quarks.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And that there
are only a handful

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of truly fundamental particles
which all fit together

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in a nice neat pattern.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was born
the standard model.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, all the
particles in the theory

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.889 align:middle line:10%
were discovered
except one, the Higgs.

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:10%


00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:10%
And the Higgs is unlike
any other particle.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the linchpin of
the standard model.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Its theory was written
down in the 1960s

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:10%
by Peter Higgs and a
number of other theorists.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:10%
We believe it is the crucial
piece responsible for holding

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Marzio, I have a plot for you.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, check this out.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:90%
This is z.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:90%
This is timing in nanoseconds.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Which we knew from
the cosmic data.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That is very nice.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:41.555 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually, upstairs, I think
people were more excited about

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:10%
this.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're in Google,
that means that's the world.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
important thing today.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the first.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And this tells us
a lot of things.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that the magnetic
properties of the machine

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:90%
are good.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:90%
That the aperture's clear.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.990 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing sticking
into the beam pipe anywhere.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very encouraging
sign, and remarkable progress.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you guys see
our beautiful plot?

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I want to show you this.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.505 align:middle line:90%
Come on, show him the plot.

00:29:07.505 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:90%
here you go.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.406 align:middle line:90%

else I can show my plot to, so.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.042 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:29:17.042 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It just worked.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are so few times
in life where it just works.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are so even
fewer times in life

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:90%
where it just works great.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:90%
We rocked.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:90%

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.047 align:middle line:90%
We destroyed that shit.

00:29:34.047 --> 00:29:36.221 align:middle line:90%
>> They got a beam circulating.

00:29:36.221 --> 00:29:40.325 align:middle line:84%
They've had beams circulating
for a full 30 seconds.

00:29:40.325 --> 00:29:44.901 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I can understand,
this is one beam going one way.

00:29:44.901 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> They have one
beam going one way,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and then they went for the
other beam going the other way.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, has it worked?

00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:51.247 align:middle line:84%
The second beams, did
they go fully around?

00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:52.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:90%
They borh went around.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I think they had the beam go
around about a million times.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

And we had to go underground
for a number of years.

escaping from Iran

be that entire 15 years might

as well have not
happened, had no impact.

I don't believe it's
just trying that counts.

The other day, I
would be convinced

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.020 align:middle line:90%
the other side was right.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:90%

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:84%
How could both of
these things be true

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.990 align:middle line:84%
if they were contrary
to each other?

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to focus
on a field where

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:84%
the truth didn't depend on
the eloquence of the speaker.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.450 align:middle line:90%
The truth was absolute.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when I started
out, I thought that within,

maybe five years, the
theories that I was working on

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
were going to be
tested, and I was

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
going to know the
experimental truth

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:84%

01:08:05.146 --> 01:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we should be
hearing rumors now.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:08.655 align:middle line:84%
We really should be
hearing rumors now.

01:08:08.655 --> 01:08:10.149 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a little
worried, actually.

01:08:10.149 --> 01:08:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we're hearing murmurs.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.862 align:middle line:90%
>> What-- what?

01:08:12.862 --> 01:08:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Murmurs, we're hearing murmurs.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.779 align:middle line:84%
Either there isn't
much there, or they're

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
doing a very good job
keeping a poker face.

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:21.439 align:middle line:84%
>> What if they're still at
a point where half of them,

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.090 align:middle line:84%
they're still trying to
figure out what's a murmur

01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:24.339 align:middle line:90%
and what's a rumor internally?

01:08:24.339 --> 01:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
probably actually true.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that, also,
I take completely innocent

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.430 align:middle line:84%
remarks and vastly
over-interpret them.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, we're going to
learn about the first discovery

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.130 align:middle line:90%
on Twitter and Facebook.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.193 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so sad.

01:08:37.193 --> 01:08:38.109 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's true.

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:38.779 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.526 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean I shouldn't
check the archive first thing

01:08:40.526 --> 01:08:41.206 align:middle line:90%
in the morning?

01:08:41.206 --> 01:08:41.614 align:middle line:10%
I need to check--

01:08:41.614 --> 01:08:42.430 align:middle line:10%
>> You should check Twitter.

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:43.546 align:middle line:10%
>> The archive's the last--

01:08:43.546 --> 01:08:45.129 align:middle line:10%
>> The last-- the
archive's the last--

01:08:45.129 --> 01:08:46.992 align:middle line:10%
>> First thing, check
Nima's Twitter feed.

01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Then check the archive.

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
If Nima has a Twitter
feed, then there's

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.850 align:middle line:90%
something has been discovered.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It is August 7, 2011, and
this is a significant time

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.680 align:middle line:90%
for the LHC.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
The first big set of data was
presented at the end of July.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
The data has little
extra bits in it

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
which could be
interpreted as a Higgs.

01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Even though the LHC is
running at half power,

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.140 align:middle line:84%
it actually has gotten
data much, much faster

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.330 align:middle line:90%
than anybody expected.

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed them to be
sensitive to the Higgs boson.

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:34.390 align:middle line:90%
It's fucking cool right now.

01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There was huge excitement
because the Higgs--

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.515 align:middle line:84%
the site of the two main
detectors, CMS and ATLAS--

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:43.359 align:middle line:84%
were first shown together
in the same meeting.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:46.529 align:middle line:84%
For me, as ground coordinator,
I discussed every little problem

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
where we lost here a
little bit of data,

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:49.979 align:middle line:90%
and there a little bit of data.

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, I really feel
attached to this data set.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, it makes me proud
if the Higgs is found

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.580 align:middle line:90%
or not with this data set, so.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> The three, two, ones.

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
So the effect--

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> The mass of the Higgs--

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.680 align:middle line:90%
namely the weight of the Higgs--

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.760 align:middle line:84%
can actually tell us or give us
a hint about what comes next.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> If the mass is
on the lighter side,

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
then that's consistent with
some of the standard things

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.540 align:middle line:90%
we've been looking for.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Supersymmetry generally
favors that the Higgs

01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
is as light as possible.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> About 115 times the
mass of the proton.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
It's 115 GeV, giga
electron volts.

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:38.570 align:middle line:10%
If on the other hand, the
Higgs is 140 GeV, 140 times

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:41.960 align:middle line:10%
the mass of a proton,
it's a terrible mass

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.310 align:middle line:10%
because 140 GeV is
associated with theories

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.230 align:middle line:10%
that rely on the multiverse.

01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> ATLAS has a little bump here.

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:54.570 align:middle line:90%
A small excess visible near 140.

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And now, holy crap!

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.430 align:middle line:90%
It's 140!

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to look like
nature has made its choice.

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we learn if the LHC
does discover a Higgs of 140

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and nothing else?

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.270 align:middle line:10%
Chaos.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with the
multiverse is that it says

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
the Higgs might be the
last particle we ever see.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So what you should do--

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
I think the Higgs mass issue.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If we don't see any new
particles besides the Higgs,

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.990 align:middle line:84%
we don't get any
explanation for dark matter.

01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how the
Higgs itself got a mass.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
We never get access
to the deeper theory.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.255 align:middle line:84%

be in the other universes.

We may be at the
end of the road.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.224 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:11:46.612 --> 01:11:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I guess-- well.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If it's right at
that number, then it

01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
would be so fucking astounding.

Where are the other particles?

01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:05.980 align:middle line:90%

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:13.877 align:middle line:90%
It always comes differently.

01:12:13.877 --> 01:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's other
interesting things or not.

01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, it always comes
differently than you expect.

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%

all up in arms because it could

be a about heavy Higgs.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
But I've always had like the
worst-case scenario I think

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:27.476 align:middle line:90%
would be Higgs and Higgs only.

it's a bit of a shame.

may take that long

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
before you know if you're
on the right track.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And jumping from
failure to failure

01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:42.980 align:middle line:84%
with undiminished enthusiasm
is the big secret to success.

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the hint that the Higgs
was 140 GeV has disappeared.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:57.130 align:middle line:10%
All of the new data
that just came in

01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:59.410 align:middle line:10%
didn't make the peak bigger.

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:02.350 align:middle line:10%
It sort of filled in the gaps.

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And now, the peak
doesn't look very good.

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the belief is
that it's gone away,

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and that the Higgs
can't be 140 GeV.

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
In order for us to believe
that we've discovered it,

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
that peak needs to
be big and basically

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
keep growing as
the data comes in.

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:27.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a statistical thing.

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
Greek letter sigma.

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
If you reach a
height of five sigma,

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that's when you know that
you've seen something.

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And the probability that
that just happens by accident

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:43.189 align:middle line:90%
is one in 3 and 1/2 million.

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:46.150 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:52.350 align:middle line:10%
But the Higgs, it's not at 140,
which is a bit of a relief,

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:56.830 align:middle line:10%
because there's still hope
it might be down around 115.

01:15:56.830 --> 01:16:01.140 align:middle line:10%
We like 115, because if
the Higgs is that light,

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:04.080 align:middle line:10%
the theory says there
has to be new particles,

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.510 align:middle line:10%
like supersymmetry.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%

universe is unstable.

on the other side.

It's cranking up the suspense
as much as it possibly can.

01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Before the LHC started,
we would always say,

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:52.920 align:middle line:84%
new physics is just
around the corner.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And now we're kind of like,
new physics is still out there.

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And for one, I am not
discouraged by this

01:31:58.890 --> 01:32:03.130 align:middle line:84%
by any means, because we
know that new physics has

01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:03.930 align:middle line:90%
to be out there.

01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:06.740 align:middle line:90%


01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
The next step is the LHC
goes into a shutdown.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
It stays off for two years
for improvements and upgrades.

01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And when it returns, it's
going to be twice the energy.

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, my vote's
for supersymmetry.

01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:24.950 align:middle line:90%

[CHUCKLES]

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:37.940 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, the Higgs is
about 125 GeV, and that means--

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:40.980 align:middle line:90%


01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:41.780 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:46.961 align:middle line:84%
Actually, almost all of my
models are ruled out, which--

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.210 align:middle line:90%
all the supersymmetry models--

01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:49.250 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty cool.

01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:52.050 align:middle line:90%


01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Supersymmetry could
still be true,

01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:59.160 align:middle line:84%
but it would have to be a very
strange version of the theory.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it's the multiverse,
while other universes would

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.910 align:middle line:84%
be amazing, of course,
but it could also

01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:10.730 align:middle line:84%
mean no other new
particles discovered.

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, a Higgs
with a mass of 125

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:19.430 align:middle line:84%
is right at a critical point
for the fate of our universe.

01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Without any other new particles,
that Higgs is unstable.

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's temporary.

01:33:26.110 --> 01:33:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And since the Higgs holds
everything together,

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
if the Higgs goes,
everything goes.

It's amazing that the Higgs, the
center of the standard model,

01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the thing we've all
been looking for,

01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:45.860 align:middle line:84%
could actually also be the
thing that destroys everything.

But we could discover
new particles,

01:34:01.731 --> 01:34:03.230 align:middle line:10%
and then none of
that would be true.

01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:06.620 align:middle line:90%


01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.576 align:middle line:84%

Which means, we were not
born to live as animals,

but to pursue
knowledge and virtue.
