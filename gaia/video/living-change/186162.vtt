Nobody sat down and
designed this thing.

And in a lot of ways,
it's sort of the worst

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%

I mean the dominant culture

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:90%

a lot of social justice problems

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%

The biggest problem it

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
the biggest implication it

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
everything else
on the planet, is

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's causing a lot
of unsustainable growth.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It's causing growth to
accelerate in a way that cannot

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
be met by the natural resources
or sinks on the planet we

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:90%
inhabit.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:90%

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:90%
It compels endless growth.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:90%
It encourages endless growth.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it encourages
the conversion of nature

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.945 align:middle line:90%
into property, into products.

00:06:40.945 --> 00:06:44.307 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.307 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem with
this growth, of course,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
is that if the economy keeps
growing, sooner or later

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
it needs natural resources
to support that growth.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the big flaws in
the current money system is

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:90%
interest.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
We would probably only need
to work half of the hours

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that we do and still
be able to maintain

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the same standard of living
if it wasn't for interest.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Interest is hidden
in so many ways--

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:84%
the price of any
goods and services.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Most businesses have loans on
which they are paying interest.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And they don't pay interest.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that we have
to work, and work, and work,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and exploit mother nature
as well in the process way

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.215 align:middle line:84%
more than would be necessary
if it wasn't for interest.

00:07:57.215 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> For a lot of the
things to keep running,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to keep the finance engine
ticking along and keep

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
economies moving, we have to
have lots and lots of energy.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Energy for extracting
natural resources, energy

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
for shipping things
around the world,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
energy for manufacturing,
energy to promote them,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
energy to keep them going,
energy to maintain things.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot of energy
used in the system.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Fossil fuel energy is energy
from the sun that's being

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
stored in plants or other living
things and has been stored

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
under the ground usually for
millions and millions of years.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
When you dig it up, you
get a free bonus basically.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
You get this amazing
wealth of energy

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
which you can do all kinds of
creative and amazing things

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is is that
when it runs out, that's it.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect
of that, of course,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
is the process of getting
it and digging it up

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
is both destructive
and also expensive

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
and requires energy to do.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Peak oil is a concept
that is quite simple.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that you have
a finite amount of something.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you consume
it at a steady rate,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:90%
then there isn't a peak.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:90%
You just consume it.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you consume it
with an increasing rate,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
then you'll hit a point where
you can't increase anymore.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And that would be a peak.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the consumption
would necessarily

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:90%
drop off in some way.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:90%

investment from fossil fuels

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:84%

it was so big.

And that's why we have the
abundance that we have now

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:90%
is just that free energy.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've been having this
crazy party for 100 years now

on fossil fuels.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just a crazy binge
that we've been on.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're at the
end of the binge

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
now because the energy
return on investment

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:90%

it's not a green revolution.

fossil fuels and the transport,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
the whole food system that we
have in the so-called developed

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
world, then there's at least 10
units of energy for every one

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:90%
we get out of it.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Basing a food production
system that's meant to feed

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
the world on something which
is temporary brings obvious

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that, is the
huge loss of biodiversity.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And while not a
lot of people care

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
about bugs and all
this other stuff,

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
biodiversity is critical.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So when you strip that
away by having what

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
we call monocultures, then
you get massive problems.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
With monocultures, we are
talking about growing one crop,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
or farming one animal, and
you don't see that in nature.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Nature doesn't work that way.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
It's evolved diversity
for resilience.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
When you take that away, these
systems become really brittle.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
prone to breaking.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we kind of stave off
the worst of those effects.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But we try to with
fossil fuel inputs.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:90%
We put in fertilizers.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
We put in herbicides,
fungicides, pesticides.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.995 align:middle line:84%
We go to great lengths to try
and protect these very fragile

00:12:31.995 --> 00:12:32.995 align:middle line:90%
food production systems.

00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:41.653 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I think what a lot
of people don't

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
realize is that our food system
is incredibly vulnerable.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
We do a pretty good
job most of the time

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:84%
of getting food
where it needs to go,

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%

surplus transportation,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:90%

How would that feel?

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's happened to me
in a major city just one day

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and it really made me think.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You begin to realize that there
is a series of things which all

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
need to be in place and all
need to be functioning properly

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%

things to run smoothly.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
In a world of increasing
climate volatility

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and the economic pressures
that that can bring,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
it's really easy to see how a
bad situation could develop.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the
kind of scary reality.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming fast.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And unless we really, really
quickly change our food system

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and how we do it,
then there's going

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to be huge impacts on humans
let alone the other animals

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:90%

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%

we aren't actually doing
the thing we have to do,

stuff in the ground, which

means what?

thing you can do then,

is hydro and geothermal.

harvesting and husbanding

Our members allow us to
create that diversity.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
That other old
system doesn't allow

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:90%
you to create that diversity.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.091 align:middle line:84%
>> CSA stands for community
supported agriculture.

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
It means that a farmer starts
growing food and growing food,

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.497 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
unknowns in there.

00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:53.705 align:middle line:84%
And you have to start at
the beginning of the season.

00:21:53.705 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know,
for whatever reason,

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to harvest
all the things that you

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
plan to harvest that you
started sowing months back.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
a group of people

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
support the farmer so the
farmer knows he's got an outlet.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And the members
that we have, they

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
know that every
week they're going

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to get a box of
healthy fresh foods

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that have been harvested
just before they got them.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
For us, it means we have
stability in effect,

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that the plants we sow,
that they are sold.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
issue of food waste

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
because if a broccoli
is small and it normally

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.300 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to
go to the supermarket,

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:90%
we can get people too.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> As a farmer, you want
to create healthy soils,

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and healthy plants,
and healthy animals.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And further up the
food chain, you

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
make sure that you create
the soil that invites

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the right sets of microbes.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
That for us means we have soil,
which is the mineral component.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
In the soil, we've
got the microorganisms

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:90%
which are governing the system.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:84%
We just create a
habitat for them.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you got the plants
growing out of there,

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.765 align:middle line:84%
be it annuals,
perennials, and trees.

00:23:28.765 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Then amongst that, you've got
the insects living in there

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and then we've incorporated
pigs, sheep, cows, ducks,

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:84%
geese, and, I'm sure, we're
forgetting a few bits and bobs.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And every single
item adds value.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So on the closed
loop systems,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
they will have tree crops,
and all that nuts, fruit,

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
all that kind of thing happening
on the fringes or in shelter

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
belts, a whole really diverse
approach to farming that is way

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
more sustainable but also
closes that nitrogen or that

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:84%
fertilizer loop so you don't
have to bring it in from

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
the outside.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:90%
You just don't waste it.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> While eating less meat is a
really important thing to do,

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
it's important to recognize
that you can't have a healthy

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:90%
ecosystem without animals.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
A truly environmentally friendly
and ecologically healthy

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
food production system
must have animals,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as you take
animals out of that system,

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
all the jobs that those
animals did in that functioning

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
ecosystem now needs to
be done some other way,

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
whether that's by
people or chemicals.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
The health of these
food production systems

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
is supported by the natural
and healthy interaction

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:90%
between plants and animals.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And that can take the form of
pest control, fertility cycles.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of interactions
between animals and plants,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
which we can and should use to
support a healthy and resilient

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:90%
food production system.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So really what that boils down
to is we need to eat less meat.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't cut it out.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But the best thing
that anyone can do

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
is try and find producers that
are operating systems which

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:84%
are looking after the health
of their environment, including

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the animals, and
supporting them.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> What comes out the back end
of a worm is really good stuff.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just
really cool just seeing

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
this hyphae of fungus,
and they're just growing

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the soil.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So holistic grazing is
a management technique

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that's been devised by a
Zimbabwean man, Allan Savory.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was observing the large
herds of Buffalo in Africa,

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and there could be bison in
America and just massive herds

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:90%
of ruminant animals.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And these animals were
constantly on the move

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.730 align:middle line:84%
because there's generally
some lions or something

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.305 align:middle line:84%
just on their back and
wanting to pick off

00:27:03.305 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:90%
any of the weak ones.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.750 align:middle line:84%
We have large mobs of cattle
that are shifted every day.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But instead of lions keeping
them bunched together,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:90%
we have electric fences.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And each day they're
going onto fresh grass.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's long grass.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.923 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
not eating it all.

00:27:21.923 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is getting trampled
and with the dung and urine

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and that, that's just
all forming that kind

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.975 align:middle line:90%
of compost heap on the ground.

00:27:28.975 --> 00:27:32.505 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:34.005 align:middle line:84%
Other farmers might
be looking at us

00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:36.047 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, you're just
wasting all that grass

00:27:36.047 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because it gets dry, and
stocky, and what have you.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But my reply is that
waste is a human concept.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Nature doesn't do waste.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.262 align:middle line:84%
And so we're using that pasture
as part of our first fertilizer

00:27:49.262 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
program because that's what's
getting put down on the soil,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and broken down, and going
back into building soil.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.700 align:middle line:84%
When the grass is grazed under
the holistic long grazing

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:84%
system, it gets cut off
short by the animal.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it also sheds its
roots at that time.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is releasing
carbon into the soil.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.138 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.138 --> 00:28:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And I guess one of the
most exciting things

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and drivers of what we're doing
is the potential that that has

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:84%
for helping with
climate change issues.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of those CAFOs
that they call

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
them the miracle or the feedlot,
cattle fattening operations

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:90%
are a climate disaster.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, under
this system, they

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
are sequestering
more carbon and are

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:84%
part of a natural cycle
that is actually beneficial.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Conventionally,
farmers, it's all

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
about keeping the grass
short in a vegetative state

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:90%
so it's growing vigorously.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And that system
works while you're

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
putting on lots of imported
fertilizers, particularly

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
phosphate fertilizers,
largely from North Africa,

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and a whole system that requires
digging up that fertilizer,

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and trucking it, and
then shipping it,

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and then trucking it, and then
processing it, and then flying

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.380 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.547 align:middle line:84%
On the whole, it's a system
that's not going to work

00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and a future with
less fossil fuels.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
on the farm here

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
is trying to reduce the
amount of fossil fuels

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:90%
that it takes to produce food.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.030 align:middle line:84%
We've got the
cattle going around.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
We have hens following
along behind the cattle.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:84%
There's these pigs
on this farm too.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're milking
a few dairy cows.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And all that is really
about using a perennial crop

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
like grass pasture with
forage from trees and that

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:84%
around as well so we can produce
eggs from the chooks and pork

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:84%
without relying on so
much of the annual grains

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and all the energy that's
involved in producing them.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So just trying to get the fossil
fuels out of our food system

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
as much as we can and producing
healthy, natural food.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The powerful thing is that
with regenerative agriculture,

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we can not only produce food
and we can not only produce

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:84%
an abundance of food, but we can
do it in a way that regenerates

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:84%
the land, that
replenishes the aquifers,

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that sequesters carbon,
that nurtures and supports

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.160 align:middle line:90%
biodiversity.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Regenerative agriculture,
permaculture,

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
holistic management-- there is
nothing magical about the way

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.450 align:middle line:90%
that these things work.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all based
upon sound science

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and about having a
point of view that

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
is looking at your
ecosystem in its entirety,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
not just individual
aspects of it.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So really what
this breaks down to

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.435 align:middle line:84%
is that anyone who's
looking after land,

00:31:01.435 --> 00:31:03.060 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a
farmer, or a gardener,

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.905 align:middle line:84%
whatever, you're an
ecosystem manager.

00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:84%
- My philosophy about
what to do in the world

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
isn't go to a pristine
area, and live there,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy your life.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It's to find a place that's
degraded and fix it up.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> 23 years ago, we started
developing the food forest

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:90%
system here.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We've got 80 different species
of plants at last count.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Then that doesn't include the
80 different types of apples

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and the 60 different
types of gooseberries.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's lovely to
have that diversity.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And it means that every time
of the year there's thing's

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
flowering, things giving
fruit, crops you can eat.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And so having
diversity is special.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.695 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes a
forest garden resilient.

00:32:13.695 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:84%
This property had been
abandoned for probably 40 years.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
No one lived here.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And an old house had
burnt down on the spot.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In the top area, this area
where the house is now was

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.180 align:middle line:84%
completely covered in junk and
the remains of the old house.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Most people would
have not even crossed

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the threshold of
the property to have

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:84%
a look at that I don't
think, because it

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.695 align:middle line:90%
didn't look very appealing.

00:32:44.695 --> 00:32:48.225 align:middle line:84%
But to us, it did, because I
thought, well, for one thing,

00:32:48.225 --> 00:32:50.350 align:middle line:84%
nobody wants it so it's
probably going to be cheap,

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:90%
and it was cheap to buy.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I
thought I can fix this.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
A food forest is a
permanent planting.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So you want to set up
just like a forest system.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So a forest system can be
the always the big trees,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and the little size trees, the
bottom layer, the ground layer.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:90%
They work together.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Some plants collect up some
minerals and give others back.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.323 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
does something else.

00:33:17.323 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Growing out in the forest
garden there, aside

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:84%
from the native
trees which I've used

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
as a framework or a platform
for building everything else--

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and those provide me with
shelter from the wind

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and also nest sites
for the birds.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And the birds are a
really important player

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:84%
in the management of the
garden and the cocoa,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
the cabbage trees that
I've got growing there,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:84%
starlings nest in
almost all of them.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And those starlings, as
they're feeding their youngers,

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
their babies are
flying out and finding

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:84%
any soft-bodied
caterpillar or grub

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:84%
they can so there's
our pest management

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.180 align:middle line:90%
for that kind of thing.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And then as an understory or
the second layer down to that,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:84%
we have our fruit tree layer,
which is our heritage apples,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and pears, and plums, and
, nectarines and peaches,

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:90%
apricots.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And then below that a
layer of berry fruits,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and currants, red currants,
black currants, white currants,

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.210 align:middle line:84%
gooseberries,
worcesterberries, all

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:84%
of those sorts of
shrubby plants that

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:90%
like to grow in the semishade.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And then wrapping
around all of that

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:84%
are the biennial and
perennial herbs, some of which

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.290 align:middle line:84%
are edible, some of
which are medicinal.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And then below that there
are bulbs and root crops

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.440 align:middle line:84%
that grow, such as
parsnips, and wild carrots,

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And then winding their way
up through these things

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
are vines like grape
vines, and kiwi fruit,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and Manchurian gooseberries,
and hops, and all

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:84%
sorts of things which kind
of bind everything together

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and tie the forest together.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so peaceful
when you walk about.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.447 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the all
different flowers,

00:35:10.447 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:90%
and the energy and action.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.643 align:middle line:84%
All the insects and the
birds have their own life.

00:35:13.643 --> 00:35:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the birds are doing all
their thing up in the trees

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.185 align:middle line:90%
and coming down to feeding.

00:35:17.185 --> 00:35:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And insects are flying
around, and having babies,

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:90%
and flying off on missions.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in
another universe really.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's, to me,
it's how life should

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.980 align:middle line:84%
be with that livingness and
the interconnectedness of all

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.364 align:middle line:84%
the plants, and
bees, and the herbs.

00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:35.286 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.286 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In a forest garden like ours,
the major player is wildness,

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is the natural world and all
of those things that happen

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.420 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And my job is just
to kind of mold

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that to suit our purposes
to a certain extent.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
We are not separate
from the wild world.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:90%
We are as wild as it is.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But we've worked
towards a form that

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is not fitting in with the
wild world at all well.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to realign
us fairly soon, in my view,

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:84%
unless we can recognize that
we need to be fully integrated

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:90%
into that world.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> People in
indigenous societies,

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:84%
in tribal societies or
in agrarian villages,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:84%
they were enmeshed in a matrix
of relationship that gave them

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:90%
a strong identity.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who they
saw on a daily basis

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:90%
knew them really well.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And we also were in intimate
connection with the land.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:54.590 align:middle line:90%
We knew every plant.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:90%
We knew every animal.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Every bird we knew its
song, and when it sang,

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and what bugs it ate, and
where those bugs lived,

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and what the soil smells
like where the bugs live,

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and what plants grow there,
and what medicine the plants

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.350 align:middle line:90%
were used for.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
We were in this
web of interbeing.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.860 align:middle line:84%
We felt as if we were
at home in the universe.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
That is missing in
our current society.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:84%
We're surrounded by a
sea of strangers, people

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that we know only very
superficially if at all.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:36.808 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.808 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:84%
For our people, the
ancestors and the land

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.656 align:middle line:90%
are all part of one.

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:43.720 align:middle line:90%
We come from the land.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And most people,
humans on the planet,

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.180 align:middle line:84%
relate to land
one way or another

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.405 align:middle line:90%
because they belong to it.

00:37:50.405 --> 00:37:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And they force their own
identity out of it as well.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And that will always
continue to happen.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like a biological bond
between a mother and a child.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:90%
You can't break it.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:84%
That bond is enforced when the
genealogy of the ancestors,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of their families, grandparents
is emotionally installed

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in that person, that they
feel that they belong here.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Interbeing is a
very natural term.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It means more than
interconnection

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:84%
or interdependency, which kind
of suggests separate selves

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.320 align:middle line:90%
having relationships.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Interbeing is more
of an understanding

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
that we are relationship, that
my very existence depends,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or draws from, or
includes your existence.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.090 align:middle line:84%
My well-being is intimately
connected to your well-being

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:84%
or to the well-being of the
river, the ocean, forest,

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:84%
people across the world, and
so forth, because I'm not

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.330 align:middle line:90%
really separate from you.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And that means that in
the story of interbeing,

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I know that whatever
I do to the world

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:90%
will come back to me somehow.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So if our true being is the
totality of our relationships

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and includes everything
in the cosmos,

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:84%
if we are truly maybe
a holographic mirror

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:84%
of all that is, then
when we cut ourselves off

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
from any aspect of nature,
other people, we create a wound.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:90%
We create a cut off.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is painful.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And we yearn to
recover our wholeness.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:48.650 align:middle line:84%
However, due to ideology, due to
the economic system that we're

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:84%
immersed in, due to
cultural factors,

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
due to many, many, many reasons,
the reunion that we long for

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:90%
is unavailable to us.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:04.077 align:middle line:84%
That is good for business,
because it drives consumerism.

00:40:04.077 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It drives inquisitiveness.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It drives greed.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It drives all kinds
of neurotic behaviors

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that seek to compensate for
the missing relationships.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:22.486 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:26.970 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt myself being drawn
into this materialistic world

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:84%
because all the people that
were around me had material

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:90%
possessions.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was all-- there was
this wanting and creating

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:84%
of attachment and wanting
and wanting more stuff.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of got swept
into that in a way.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I studied business.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was involved in finance
and more specifically,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.880 align:middle line:90%
the stock market.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So we used to help people
manage their money.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
organizations I worked with,

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
we used to manage hundreds of
millions of dollars for people.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't from that background,
from a conservative sort

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.940 align:middle line:90%
of upbringing.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a
sudden, I'm involved

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.300 align:middle line:84%
with guys that are
driving luxury cars

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and living in expensive
houses in Sydney's suburbs.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.430 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of a bit overwhelming.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the guys
that I'd work with,

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.710 align:middle line:90%
they were multimillionaires.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.990 align:middle line:90%
But $20 million wasn't enough.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So they have to
have the three cars.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.790 align:middle line:84%
They have to have
a holiday home.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.400 align:middle line:90%
They have to have a boat.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you can
get trapped in that lifestyle.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to have native
plants mixed among fruit trees.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:90%
So we've got natives here.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.430 align:middle line:90%
We've got a tamarillo here.

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:84%
We've got manuka and kanuka
and [INAUDIBLE] natives.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.620 align:middle line:90%
We've got a cabbage tree here.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a pine nut.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.675 align:middle line:84%
So those are real expensive
nuts you get in a supermarket.

00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:90%
This is one of those.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It takes about 10 years to get
any fruit on it or any nuts,

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:90%
so that's a long-term project.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And then over here
we've got a fig tree,

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:90%
which is fruiting quite nicely.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And then-- oh, for the
monarch butterflies,

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:29.215 align:middle line:84%
we've got a couple of swan
plants, which they really

00:42:29.215 --> 00:42:30.015 align:middle line:90%
enjoy.

00:42:30.015 --> 00:42:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And we might be
lucky to see one.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Here he comes now.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It was only after Beth, my
wife, and I made the move

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
to New Zealand--
we just had enough

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:46.440 align:middle line:84%
of the whole corporate life,
and we wanted a slower, simpler

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.430 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It was then the realization
sort of hit home.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I started to research more,
read hundreds of articles

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and watched hundreds
of documentaries

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of stuff.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to
really understand, wow,

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:84%
we've got some
serious issues here,

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and no one's really
talking about this stuff.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite scary.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess with realization
of some of the broader

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:84%
issues such as climate
change, peak oil or resource

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
depletion, and the
extinction crisis

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:84%
we're currently going
through-- and it's

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:84%
sort of like these
massive issues are

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:84%
being given lip service by
governments and organizations.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, it'll
just won't happen.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.117 align:middle line:84%
Or the system will
solve this problem.

00:43:38.117 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
sort of feels like.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that brings
up a lot of emotions,

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:84%
like frustration
and anger and guilt.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, why isn't someone
doing something about this?

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Here's a strawberry.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.653 align:middle line:90%
Here's a strawberry.

00:43:53.653 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:90%
So this is a nice one.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Look at the color on it thing.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to
research permaculture

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and realized that
it was an integrated

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:90%
approach to how we're living.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment,
our current society--

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.450 align:middle line:84%
it's a fragmented
approach to living.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So everything's
compartmentalized or separated.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.587 align:middle line:84%
Whereas permaculture
is a holistic approach

00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:16.420 align:middle line:90%
to how we're living.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.048 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.048 --> 00:44:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It integrates food, environment
with your lifestyle and taking

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:84%
care of people, the planet,
and the natural resources.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people come
over to our property

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and have a look around.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And they go, what
about your fruit trees?

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you get pests and
stuff like birds?

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.270 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yeah, sure.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:90%
But we don't mind that.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:84%
They were here first, and
we're a part of nature.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And we've had comments from
other people that live around

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.650 align:middle line:90%
near us on the farms.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:54.225 align:middle line:84%
And they say they can't believe
how much wildlife and bird

00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:90%
life is here.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And their properties just
a few hundred meters away

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.106 align:middle line:84%
have almost no
wildlife or bird life.

00:45:03.106 --> 00:45:18.190 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're attracting
bird life and wildlife

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.478 align:middle line:84%
through just letting
nature be as opposed

00:45:24.478 --> 00:45:25.520 align:middle line:90%
to wanting to control it.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Permaculture links
into other aspects

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
like collaboration,
localization, food resiliency,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and networking.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about growing food.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It's about connecting
a whole system

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and integrating a whole
system into one's life.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:52.070 align:middle line:84%
This lifestyle working on the
land and doing permaculture

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:84%
feels more rewarding and like
I'm putting something back.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We also live a less
consumerist lifestyle,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.850 align:middle line:90%
so we don't need as much stuff.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't got
this constant craving

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:84%
for more and more things to
make me feel satisfied or happy.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.140 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.310 align:middle line:90%
We have homegrown salad--

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.230 align:middle line:90%
fruit salad and green salad--

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and some eggs.

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:21.293 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe
still that I don't

00:46:21.293 --> 00:46:22.460 align:middle line:90%
have to go to a supermarket.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We've grown all this
ourselves in just three years.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm still amazed.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:28.700 align:middle line:90%
So anyone can do it.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.430 align:middle line:84%
When I was living
in big cities, it

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:43.220 align:middle line:84%
was like I had to get away
to connect with nature.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I wake up every
morning, I come outside,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'm immediately
in nature here.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that void anymore.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.375 align:middle line:84%
I've just got this instant
connection and satisfaction.

00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:55.250 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to explain.

00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you've had
this experience,

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.378 align:middle line:84%
feeling like I'm
not living my life.

00:47:07.378 --> 00:47:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm living the life
I'm paid to live.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:90%
But what about my life?

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a different
dimension of human nature

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that we need to invoke,
we need to implement.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to create conditions
for that part of human nature

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.500 align:middle line:90%
to blossom.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:33.864 align:middle line:90%

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We had been
living in Katikati,

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and I was working a regular job
as a GP in the practice there.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I just found
these kind of warning signs

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that I was starting
to get out of balance.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.092 align:middle line:84%
I'd be lovely with my
patients, but I'd come home

00:47:57.092 --> 00:47:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and be kind of shitty.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling quite depressed.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of the internal
cogs weren't running together

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.610 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And we started talking about
it and thought, well, maybe we

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.270 align:middle line:84%
really need to kind of radically
rethink how we want to live.

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So the house is
20 square meters.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It started with a sheep
shearer's quarters

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.850 align:middle line:84%
just to the side of us
here, and that was maybe

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:32.670 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago that
that was built.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So our bedroom is
the original cabin.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And then this L-shaped space is
our kitchen, lounge, library,

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:90%
office, day bed.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything, yeah.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:90%
20 square meters.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.510 align:middle line:84%
We've got a shower just
adjoining and a bit of a deck

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:55.583 align:middle line:90%
out the back.

00:48:55.583 --> 00:48:57.000 align:middle line:84%
A few months ago,
a friend of mine

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.990 align:middle line:84%
helped me put a 300-watt
panel up on the roof.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that powers the broadband
and telephone and a bit

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:90%
more light.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.020 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.797 align:middle line:90%
Now we can--

00:49:08.797 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Use the sewing machine,
which is very exciting.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the sewing
machine is good.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.030 align:middle line:90%


00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when
they hear about it, they--

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.150 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, how is
that with a baby?

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And even before that, how
is that just the two of you?

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think actually it's great
with a baby living in a small

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:30.790 align:middle line:84%
space in that wherever she
is, she's never that far away.

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite easy
to be doing whatever

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I need to be doing and
keeping an eye on her.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And when she's sleeping,
she'll be close by.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.661 align:middle line:90%
>> We have--

00:49:47.661 --> 00:49:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the term for it,
like a work-trade arrangement

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.837 align:middle line:90%
with the owners.

00:49:52.837 --> 00:49:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And we've been living
here just over a year.

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So about three or four days
a week, I'm on the farm.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And then part time
I work as a GP.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So our costs are fractional to
what they were living in town.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any stress about
money, which is a huge benefit.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.008 align:middle line:90%
Emotionally I'm healthier.

00:50:17.008 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:90%


00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a choice wanting to be
more immersed in my environment

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and more directly
connected with my needs,

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.050 align:middle line:90%
where my food was coming from.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And I love going out and
seeing the garden each day

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how
things have changed.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's like having
a relationship with a living

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:45.942 align:middle line:90%
thing, lots of living things.

00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Regularly tending
in the garden,

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I had this feeling of almost
being in love with the garden,

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.060 align:middle line:90%
which blew me away.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The future of humanity is
to return to that relationship

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.596 align:middle line:84%
to nature and to all beings
and all human beings too,

00:51:09.596 --> 00:51:12.630 align:middle line:90%
to fall in love with the world.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.595 align:middle line:90%
Its well-being is my well-being.

00:51:14.595 --> 00:51:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:20.660 align:middle line:84%
If we really were in
love with the planet

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and incorporated that love
into all of our systems,

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:28.395 align:middle line:84%
into our money system, we would
not have an ecological crisis.

00:51:28.395 --> 00:51:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If an economy is operating
outside of ecological limits,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.030 align:middle line:84%
then the inevitable
conclusion is that it's going

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:45.440 align:middle line:84%
to completely erode the
resource base until it implodes

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.240 align:middle line:90%
or collapses.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.770 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So really, the
choice that we have

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.190 align:middle line:84%
is to design and develop
an economy that operates

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.540 align:middle line:90%
within ecological limits.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.748 align:middle line:90%
That's our only safe bet.

00:51:57.748 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:90%
It's our only bet at all.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we think about the
whole problem of deflation

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and what could happen
post-collapse in a country that

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.790 align:middle line:84%
experiences a sudden reversal
and this loss of liquidity,

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.850 align:middle line:84%
where the money supply really,
really gets chopped down,

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.428 align:middle line:90%
people still have needs.

00:52:19.428 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:84%
People still have
goods and services.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:24.260 align:middle line:84%
They're going to find a
way to exchange those.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle line:84%
What you want is the
easiest possible way

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:90%
to make this happen.

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is where alternative
currencies would plug the gap.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:84%
If a central government
were quick-thinking quick

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.180 align:middle line:84%
off the mark and
actually had a plan

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.010 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with
this stuff, they

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.760 align:middle line:84%
could introduce a new currency,
maybe a parallel currency,

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:47.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe a replacement currency
to counteract the disappearance

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.980 align:middle line:90%
of all the bank money.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.540 align:middle line:84%
That probably won't
happen, though.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be up to
local and regional currencies

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.060 align:middle line:90%
to fill that void.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I woke up one morning and
jumped out of bed without even

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.740 align:middle line:84%
being conscious yet, saying,
I'm going to start a local

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.110 align:middle line:90%
currency.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt so much joy.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.880 align:middle line:84%
There was just this
energy moving through me.

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.170 align:middle line:84%
LOAVES stands for Local Origin
Ashurst Voluntary Exchange

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:90%
System.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
acronyms that you

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.480 align:middle line:84%
fit the words to the acronym
instead of the other way

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.030 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It is meant to be a
voucher system that

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:35.240 align:middle line:84%
circulates in Ashurst
and the Pohangina Valley

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:41.000 align:middle line:84%
as a voluntary alternative
to using money for exchange.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So LOAVES is primarily trading
at the Ashurst Community

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Market, and we have about
a dozen or so businesses

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:90%
that are accepting it there.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.940 align:middle line:90%
We've got the cheesery.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.920 align:middle line:90%
We've got the fudgery.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.930 align:middle line:84%
We have several
plant businesses.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.540 align:middle line:84%
We have a business
consultant who accepts it

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.130 align:middle line:90%
outside of the market.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's half a dozen others
that are accepting it as well.

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:06.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary benefits
of the currency in my mind

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.590 align:middle line:84%
is the awareness raising
that goes along with it.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:13.130 align:middle line:84%
We're after not the currency
itself but the relationships

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:15.050 align:middle line:90%
that come out of the currency.

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So one of the major things
is this awareness campaign

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.650 align:middle line:84%
around the benefits of buying
local, the benefits of having

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:84%
a commitment between
customers and businesses,

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.780 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what's available
in your own community,

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.880 align:middle line:84%
of going to town
instead of the city

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.540 align:middle line:84%
when you need something, of
supporting your neighbors

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and looking to your neighbors
and their businesses

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:39.950 align:middle line:84%
as a primary way of
meeting your needs.

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The wealth generated by
using our local currency--

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.580 align:middle line:90%
100% of it stays here.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.730 align:middle line:84%
There's no interest,
and it just keeps

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:53.240 align:middle line:84%
circulating and recirculating
in the local community.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And rather than being
considered in competition

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:02.120 align:middle line:84%
with the national money, it's
actually complementary to it.

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.210 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So you strengthen
these local connections.

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's a
very resilient thing

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:14.370 align:middle line:84%
to do because it just means
that if things are rough,

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:18.690 align:middle line:84%
you've got friends, neighbors,
and people in your region that

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.400 align:middle line:84%
are able to help
one another out.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Time banking is a very
interesting development

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:31.070 align:middle line:84%
in that it uses a very
egalitarian basis.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:34.400 align:middle line:84%
It says everybody's
time is equal.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.870 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't matter
how skilled you are

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.960 align:middle line:84%
or what your
qualifications are or what

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.990 align:middle line:84%
you do for your day job,
that your hour is worth

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:90%
the same as my hour.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:56:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Maria Lee from Te Mahi
Kai at Diamond Harbour School,

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.390 align:middle line:84%
which is a gardening
to cooking program.

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So we teach the children how
to grow everything themselves.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And they put the seeds in
then look after the garden.

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's my turn,
we harvest what they've

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:24.260 align:middle line:90%
grown and turn it into lunch.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So today we're making kale
chips and broad bean dip.

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And each week, it's different.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.280 align:middle line:84%
The idea is just to teach
them some basics of cooking.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And in order for that to work,
we use time bank volunteers.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't do
it without them.

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Our volunteers are
paid 1 credit per hour

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:84%
that they come and
volunteer for us.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So we take those from the
school time bank credit system

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and give it to them.

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And then they use that to
trade for whatever they need.

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's always easier to build
your barn while the sun is

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.110 align:middle line:84%
shining than try to put
it up in a howling gale.

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you put these
things together now,

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:19.510 align:middle line:84%
if you get a system up and
running, and especially

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.010 align:middle line:84%
with something like
a local currency

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.950 align:middle line:84%
where there may be some
marketing involved,

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to get buy-in
from people and all

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that-- you don't create one of
these things out of whole cloth

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.776 align:middle line:84%
and get it widely
accepted overnight.

00:57:31.776 --> 00:57:35.640 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's no
getting away from it.

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.180 align:middle line:84%
A huge part of this is that we
just consume too much stuff.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.400 align:middle line:90%


00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Our entire economy
is built on getting

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:49.535 align:middle line:84%
us to buy and consume,
dispose, and re-consume things.

00:57:49.535 --> 00:57:52.670 align:middle line:90%


00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
realistic that we can expect

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.272 align:middle line:84%
to live in a world where we
don't make things or use things

00:57:57.272 --> 00:57:58.730 align:middle line:84%
or use resources--
of course we do.

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But we need to use them
in a way that is smart.

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's about intelligent use.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's about being efficient
and not wasteful.

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion of waste is
something that wasn't around

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.450 align:middle line:90%
200 or 300 years ago.

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:90%
We just didn't have waste.

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Things had utility.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Things have value
all the way through.

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And if they reached the
end of productivity,

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.140 align:middle line:84%
they were know reformed
into something else.

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Bayswater
Repair Cafe.

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:39.530 align:middle line:84%
A repair cafe is a
free pop-up event

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:45.290 align:middle line:84%
where local community experts
in a variety of different areas

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:48.080 align:middle line:84%
offer their skills and
services to other people

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.620 align:middle line:84%
in their local
community for free.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Every year we send a
crazy amount of stuff

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.710 align:middle line:90%
to holes in the ground.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is about
maybe doing something

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to address some of
that flow, but also

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.280 align:middle line:84%
in the process of doing that,
bringing people together

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:08.330 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful way
that connects people.

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Create some networks and
maybe even some friendships.

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've got five different
repair areas at the cafe today.

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We've got our electrical
appliances repair space,

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and that is overwhelmingly
the most popular area.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So people bring in toasters
and lamps and all kinds

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.910 align:middle line:90%
of random bits and pieces.

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We've got a clothing
repair space,

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and we've got a team of
seamstresses and a seamster,

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.955 align:middle line:84%
if that's the right word,
who are mending clothes.

00:59:43.955 --> 00:59:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:53.270 align:middle line:84%
We've got a guy who is repairing
wood and pieces of furniture.

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've got general
repairs, and we've also

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.930 align:middle line:90%
got two bike mechanics.

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking to the daughter
of one of the volunteers who

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.620 align:middle line:90%
helped out with repairs.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And he was an older guy.

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her that he
felt a real sense of belonging

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and a real sense of feeling
useful and having purpose.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was an
amazing outcome from the day,

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.050 align:middle line:84%
to make someone feel
good about having shared

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:33.700 align:middle line:90%
their skills with local people.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a beautiful example
of a community initiative

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
that brings people together
and enhances connection,

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
enhances a sense of
community and neighborhood.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And we fix a lot of stuff.

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But more important
than that, I think,

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.864 align:middle line:84%
is the building of
connection and community.

01:00:53.864 --> 01:00:58.810 align:middle line:90%


01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important to
remember that when you dispose

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
of something, you
can't throw it away.

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:07.545 align:middle line:84%
When you throw something,
it goes somewhere.

01:01:07.545 --> 01:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
You might not know
where that is.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.128 align:middle line:84%
It may be out of your sight,
may be out of your mind.

01:01:11.128 --> 01:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
such place as away.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:17.690 align:middle line:90%


01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2007, we were really
starting to think about

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
our impacts that we were having,
just our regular day-to-day

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
actions.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things we focused on

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.243 align:middle line:84%
was how much rubbish
we were producing.

01:01:28.243 --> 01:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We could have
focused on anything,

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
but rubbish was so visual.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're-- just every week
rubbish bags filling up.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we somehow decided
to challenge ourselves.

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We can't even remember
whose idea it was now.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But we did this crazy thing
where we thought, right,

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
we're going to try and make no
rubbish for the entire year.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.560 align:middle line:84%
We were genuinely
not green people.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We were putting out a
bag of rubbish every week

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.520 align:middle line:90%
without fail.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And we had literally never
thought about it before.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
We sort of-- it came to us
one day and went, oh my gosh,

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.580 align:middle line:90%
this is terrible.

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the challenge
was to try and live for one year

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
with less than a city
council rubbish bag.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And most of it was
made up of items

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
that were out of our control.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So the radiator hose
on the car burst,

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.028 align:middle line:90%
and so we had a radiator hose.

01:02:17.028 --> 01:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to carry on doing
things that you'd normally do.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So we were renovating
our home back then.

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And we had all the lead paint
from scraping the weather

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.945 align:middle line:90%
boards.

01:02:26.945 --> 01:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So in practical terms,
that's all we had left over.

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:35.310 align:middle line:90%


01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I think when we look at the
average rubbish bin, what

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
people are putting out, at least
50% of it's generally organics.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you take the biggest
things out first, right?

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So deal with organics
is the no-brainer.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you're 50%
ahead of the average citizen.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another sort
of 30% of recyclable material

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
generally these days
in the rubbish bin.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.760 align:middle line:90%
So there's the next thing.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
So you deal with the organics.

01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Then you recycle
everything you can.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting up
in-- by that stage,

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.770 align:middle line:90%
you've made massive gains.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
People can feel overwhelmed and
feel that what they're doing

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make a difference.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But most of the waste we create
or we're kind of complicit in

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.100 align:middle line:90%
is waste we've never seen.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So we'll buy
something, and there'll

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
be a bit of packaging
around it that we see.

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But in making that item, that's
when the bulk of the waste

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.750 align:middle line:90%
is created.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:34.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you're putting
out a rubbish bag,

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
it actually represents
70 rubbish bags of waste

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
that you've never
seen that has gone

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.260 align:middle line:90%
into making that bag of waste.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Consumers have it tough, right?

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of money goes into
marketing and sending

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
the messages that you can buy
our compostable packaging,

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're saving
the environment.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, compostable
packaging in any landfill

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.340 align:middle line:90%
is just as bad.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the sort of thing that
actually needs to be composted

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
at very hot temperatures, so
it really needs commercial

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:10.300 align:middle line:90%
composting to be done properly.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
problems in my business

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that I have to go to
vendors and say, I'm sorry.

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I know you've paid
more and you've

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
been promised that this is eco
and compostable by the person

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.810 align:middle line:90%
that sold it to you.

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't actually go and
do their product stewardship

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and find out whether the
composting industry can take it

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.858 align:middle line:90%
in every place.

01:04:31.858 --> 01:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we've actually
got consumers that want to do

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.950 align:middle line:90%
the right thing.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.525 align:middle line:84%
We've got businesses that
are doing amazing stuff.

01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a government
completely missing

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
in action in terms of providing
a framework to encourage

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.402 align:middle line:90%
those behaviors more and more.

01:04:46.402 --> 01:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you do buy a
container at the supermarket,

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:50.622 align:middle line:84%
you make sure it's a
reusable container.

01:04:50.622 --> 01:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you wash it
out, and you take it

01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
into one of these stores and
you get them to weigh it.

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you fill it up
with whatever you want,

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and they take the weight of it.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've just stopped
thick plastic packaging.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If people are combining
composting and learning how

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.857 align:middle line:84%
to recycle and they're just
putting a bit of extra thought

01:05:05.857 --> 01:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
into how they're shopping,
particularly considering that

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:12.400 align:middle line:90%
packaging--

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
it's that choice when
you're at the supermarket

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
or at Bunnings or whatever,
thinking about the item,

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
essentially if it's plastic or
got other composite materials

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:25.200 align:middle line:90%
in it.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
What can you do with
it at the end of life?

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be rubbish.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be around
for thousands of years.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Every time we spend a
dollar, it's a vote.

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
We have so much
power, so much more

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:39.250 align:middle line:90%
power than what we realize.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's like keep
on that knife edge.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, see that it's a big--

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
yes, there's big issues.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.968 align:middle line:84%
But also yes, we can
make a difference.

01:05:46.968 --> 01:05:49.490 align:middle line:90%


01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> There's part of me when
I go to recycle my bottles

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
or compost my waste, it's like,
well, what good does it do?

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm just subtracting
one plastic bottle

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.910 align:middle line:84%
from the enormous trash heap
that gets shipped to India

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and is making new mountains
in India and China of waste.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Like, what does it matter,
one bottle different?

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well,
if everybody did it,

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:21.060 align:middle line:90%
then it would make a difference.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.460 align:middle line:90%
So you have to do your part.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But part of you will say,
well, I'm not everybody.

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody does it, then
it doesn't matter if I do it.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
another reason.

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
For me, it comes down to
relationship and ritual.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I like to save my compost
and use composting toilets,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
for example, not because I've
done some calculation that this

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to save the
world, but because it's

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
a different kind of relationship
with the beings around me.

01:06:53.870 --> 01:07:02.570 align:middle line:90%


01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Composting toilets, like
composting your own shit,

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
processing your
own toilet waste,

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is a real basic fundamental
thing that we should all

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:11.170 align:middle line:90%
practice.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple way
of demonstrating

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
self-responsibility.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So with a flush toilet,
basically you take really nice

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
clean drinking water and a
shit and mix the two together,

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.210 align:middle line:90%
both wonderful resources.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
When you mix them together,
you create a toxic problem.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So with a compost
toilet system, you're

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
able to capture that amazing
resource and take care of it

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and treat it in a way
that removes any pathogens

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.795 align:middle line:84%
or problems and create
a wonderful resource.

01:07:47.795 --> 01:07:52.460 align:middle line:90%


01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so welcome to our toilet.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.860 align:middle line:84%
For a start, it's a composting
toilet bucket bench system.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
We've got cover
material which we

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.930 align:middle line:90%
use old sawdust from the mill.

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's already got bacteria
and bit of fungus in it.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So you go make your deposit,
put a bit of cover material

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
on, leave it.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And then when we've got a
certain amount of buckets,

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
we go to the compost and
add straw and garden waste

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.420 align:middle line:90%
and kitchen waste.

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.240 align:middle line:90%


01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.779 align:middle line:84%
And this is one I
did maybe a week ago.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And we'll put the compost
thermometer in here

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and see what we're looking at.

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.399 align:middle line:84%
We're still looking
at 50 degrees.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.529 align:middle line:90%
It's going up.

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
It got up to 65
degrees the other day.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.877 align:middle line:90%
I recorded it a bit.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There are pathogens
you have to consider.

01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:39.859 align:middle line:84%
There's roundworm eggs and
all these different kinds

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of worm eggs that can
exist in your manure.

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you do a hot compost,
that's the safest way.

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you can nuke all
those things within hours.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.170 align:middle line:90%


01:08:54.170 --> 01:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And over here
is what you get.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.109 align:middle line:84%
I put it in a bag,
but you don't need to.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:09.950 align:middle line:90%
That there is about a year old.

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It's got lots of worms in it.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We put all our garden waste and
all our kitchen waste in here.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.450 align:middle line:90%
But the worms are a good sign.

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:21.666 align:middle line:84%
If you've got worms, it means
it's not too acidic and mm,

01:09:21.666 --> 01:09:23.630 align:middle line:90%
yum, good stuff.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And that goes straight on the
garden, and the plants love it.

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:28.189 align:middle line:90%
And we love the plants.

01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:31.185 align:middle line:90%


01:09:31.185 --> 01:09:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When it's
finished composting,

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't look like or
smell like anything like poo.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.579 align:middle line:84%
It's just beautiful
black compost.

01:09:39.579 --> 01:09:41.149 align:middle line:90%
So we've monitored it closely.

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.399 align:middle line:90%
We've watched the temperature.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We know all the pathogens
have been nuked.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We feel confident
in our process.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So we feel safe to
use it in our garden.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do this.

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just really a matter of
being engaged and wanting to do

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.660 align:middle line:90%
it and getting the knowledge.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a knowledge-based system.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not technological or
anything really advanced.

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people do it
in cities with a wee

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.740 align:middle line:90%
backyard, small backyard, yeah.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen people do it
in really rural settings.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of being engaged.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's for everyone,
everyone who wants to take more

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:23.810 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for themselves
and not pass it off,

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:25.060 align:middle line:90%
everyone who values their poo.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I value my poo.

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:32.890 align:middle line:90%


01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I value your poo to, so
you're welcome to leave

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.480 align:middle line:90%
a deposit before you go.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of expected
actually, no pressure.

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:52.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We've come to see
that in order to be part

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of the solution, we really need
to use our everyday choices

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:01.220 align:middle line:90%
to change our behavior.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cultural
shift that needs

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to happen in order for us to at
least sustain ourselves, which

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
isn't even enough
of course because,

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.352 align:middle line:90%
what are we sustaining?

01:11:11.352 --> 01:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
something I've really

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.477 align:middle line:84%
been putting a lot
of time into recently

01:11:14.477 --> 01:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
is designing my work so that
it's actually regenerative.

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:25.160 align:middle line:90%


01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Sort of out of necessity I
started this organic waste

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.280 align:middle line:90%
collection.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.542 align:middle line:90%
Check this out, whoa!

01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:33.290 align:middle line:90%


01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Here we're currently
picking about 2 and 1/2 tons

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
up each week from
local businesses.

01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And instead of that all going
into a hole in the ground,

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
it gets returned
back to the soil

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
by way of windrow
aerobic composting.

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So we currently have
around 45 businesses

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%
on the Why Waste collection.

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And they have a number of bins
or buckets, mostly wheelie

01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
bins, and some have up to five
wheelie bins at their business.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And every week Why Waste
comes and picks it up,

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and we take it to--

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
we weigh it, we record all
the data, things like that.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We take it to a
composting facility.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, we're in
partnership with them

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
so that we can return that
waste back to the soil.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.695 align:middle line:84%
Recently, one of my
clients rang me up.

01:12:23.695 --> 01:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were super
stoked because they

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
were able to cancel
this big, like, skip bin

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.200 align:middle line:90%
for their rubbish.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And now they just use a
240-liter wheelie bin,

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.400 align:middle line:90%
which is much, much smaller.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's as a result of all
of their compostable waste

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:44.100 align:middle line:90%
going back to the soil.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.543 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what's that?

01:12:45.543 --> 01:12:47.467 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a tasty muffin!

01:12:47.467 --> 01:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm really passionate
about composting

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
as a solution of
minimizing our waste

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and our impact here on this
one planet that we have.

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Food scraps and
biodegradable waste

01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
takes up over a third of
what we send to landfill.

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:16.200 align:middle line:84%
When biodegradable matter
biodegrades anaerobically,

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
it produces a lot
of methane, which

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is 23 times worse than carbon
dioxide as a greenhouse gas.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And not only do you get that
gas going into the atmosphere,

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.050 align:middle line:84%
but you also get
a liquid version

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:34.665 align:middle line:84%
of it leaching into our
soils, into our water table.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:37.470 align:middle line:90%


01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying
to achieve here

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
is build a really hot
compost around this drum

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.790 align:middle line:90%
and also all of this--

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
build all this
irrigation into it

01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
so that when that aerobic
hot compost heats up,

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:57.530 align:middle line:84%
we should be able to pump
water through the system

01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
out and over to these
bathtubs over here

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and have free
biologically-heated hot water.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm so
enthusiastic about compost

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is that it's fertility
in its purest form.

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
This is how nature
builds soil, and that

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:21.540 align:middle line:90%
enables us to grow more food.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.683 align:middle line:84%
And if people are
conscious of composting,

01:14:25.683 --> 01:14:28.100 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going to
become more conscious about what

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
they're eating.

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
opening less packets,

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:32.900 align:middle line:90%
that's good for everyone.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.290 align:middle line:90%
That's good for the planet.

01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's good for our people.

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
If we can get people to
focus on eating better,

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.980 align:middle line:84%
then we're actually able to
produce a lot less landfill

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
waste and a lot more
biodegradable waste, which

01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
then can be turned into more
fertility to produce more food.

01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So the healthier we eat, the
better our waste is and much

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
easier to manage and
return to the land.

in that truth presently.

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather think
global and act global,

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%

somewhere, you know?

the change that I'm

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But I do catch
glimpses sometimes.

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
One thing that comes to
me is that in the future

01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:22.400 align:middle line:84%
we'll feel really at
home in the world.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.990 align:middle line:84%
We will be intimately familiar
with the landscape around us.

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:33.300 align:middle line:90%
We will be in rich communities.

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The best experiences you've
had in your life, the most

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:40.230 align:middle line:90%
authentic, the most vibrant--

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
those don't have
to be exceptions.

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Trust what feels loving.

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Trust what feels good.

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Trust what feels aligned
with who you really are.

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
If you live by that and spread
that vibe and other people

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
start living by that,
then the whole planet

01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:59.110 align:middle line:90%
is going to change.

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:18.610 align:middle line:90%
