00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was very young,
I didn't really believe any

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of the theories about
how the world worked,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
whether I learned it from school
in science or my religious

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:84%
teachings, my
Methodist religion.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe, really.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:90%
None of it really satisfied me.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
exploring other types

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual kinds of text.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So things like Kabbalah or
theosophy or anthroposophy.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of things
really interested me.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:10%
I also read "The Dead Sea
Scrolls," books of the Bible

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:10%
that they claim weren't
put into the Bible,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:10%
because I wanted to
know what was really

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:10%
going on with our world.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
What was our purpose?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
find these answers.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I realized
from all of the reading

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that I did that the
best way to find out

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:90%
is through personal experience.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And meditation was
something I had learned

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
about that you could
get quiet inside

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to access things
like maybe your intuition

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
or telepathic abilities.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to learn
how all of this worked.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
When I first tried to meditate,
it was really impossible.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I would simply watch more
breath and close my eyes

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and wait for my mind to empty,
and it wasn't so simple.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I would try to meditate and all
I would hear is grocery lists

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
or what conversation I wanted
to have with my boss next week.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
This was not quieting the mind
at all, until I found sound.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And certain types
of sound really

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
helped me find that
quiet space inside.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So at first it was things
like gongs or tuning forks

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:90%
or brass bowls, crystal bowls.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.262 align:middle line:90%
[HUM]

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of sound really
helped me to quiet the brain.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Now in modern times,
we have something

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
called binaural
beats, and these are

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
sounds created with
digital frequencies that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
create that wah, wah sound,
but in very deliberate ways.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And what those sounds
are designed to do,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
binaural beats are
at their most basic

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
putting one frequency in one
ear and a slightly different

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:90%
frequency in the other ear.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's the difference
between those two frequencies

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that's important.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And that difference
is driving what

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
we believe is a brainwave
state associated

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:90%
with states of meditation.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
When you take an EEG device that
measures the electric signal

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of the
brain, it comes out

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:90%
in hertz or cycles per second.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And zero to four hertz
is delta, and that's

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:10%
the state that's associated
with sleep or coma.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:10%
Four to seven hertz is
theta, and that's associated

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:10%
with deep meditative states.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:10%
Seven to about 12
hertz is alpha,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:10%
and that's associated with
being relaxed or very focused.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
12 to, say, 30 hertz,
that's the beta state.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the state we're in
when we're walking, talking.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's the state we want
to kind of remove ourselves

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
from and get into that lower
state of awareness associated

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
with meditation.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Between delta and
theta, that's the state

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:90%
between asleep and awake.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And others call this
the hypnagogic state.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
When you can get the body
very profoundly relaxed,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
but the mind is
still aware, that's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
the state we're very
interested in, because this

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
is where we can start to
make real change in ourselves

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and also start to
notice things that

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:90%
are beyond the physical body.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And so one of those
things is the observer.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:90%
We call it the inner observer.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of you
that's behind the thoughts.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the most common
meditative sort of directions

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:90%
is to watch your breath.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you notice
your mind wandering,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
return your attention
to the breath.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's the part of you
that notices your mind

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
is wandering that we're
most interested in.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:90%
This is not your thoughts.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
This is not your
reactive emotions.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're used to
thinking of as who we are.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But when we can get behind
all that-- and binaural beats

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
can help us do
that, because they

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
help to reduce our awareness
of those ongoing thoughts

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and get us into an
awareness that's more

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.860 align:middle line:90%
associated with maybe dreaming.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:90%
But we're very aware.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of sounds can be
used for all kinds of reasons.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people use them just to
get a better night's sleep,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
because we can feed those
signals that will put you

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:90%
into a more restful state.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But other people use
them to gain more focus

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:90%
when they're studying.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
People use them to get more
creative, to access creativity

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that is from within.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So painters or writers can
use it to kind of open up

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:90%
those channels.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you
can use these recordings

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
to relieve stress and anxiety.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think this really
speaks to this correlation

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
between our inner world
and our outer world.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And so when we get
ourselves kind of in order

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
in our inner world, that's
when things in our outer world

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:90%
really start to change.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And this can be kind
of counterintuitive,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
but the way this works is when
we can think of things that we

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:90%
want to have in our lives--

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's a
more fulfilling job,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.075 align:middle line:90%
more fulfilling employment.

00:05:54.075 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:90%
How do we get there?

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, many people
use affirmations

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
where they speak the things
that they want in their minds.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But a more powerful
way to do this

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
is to bring your
feelings into it.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
that we recommend

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
when people want to bring
something new into their lives

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is to imagine, what would
it feel like if you already

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
had that fulfilling,
satisfying job?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
We can all imagine what it would
feel like to have something

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
that we wish to have.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what needs to
be added to just our thoughts.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And very often, when you
start to go within and start

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to that
inner world, at least

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in my case and many
that I've spoken to,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
we start to find little things
that don't seem to belong,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
things that we maybe
thought we had dealt with.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So things like deep
loneliness or despair

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
might come up when you
start to get quiet inside.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know I thought
to myself, well,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
when I felt this
kind of despair,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, I'm not lonely.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I have friends.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I eventually
discovered is

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that I was triggering an
emotional trauma that I

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
had maybe 20 years
ago in my childhood

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't really
dealt with, and I had just

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
stored into my system.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start
to imagine things

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that we want to
have in our lives,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
if there's conflicting
feelings inside,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that can really put a
damper on everything.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
important to understand

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
all of your emotional reactions,
all of the kinds of limiting

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:84%
beliefs you might
have about things

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
that you want to generate
happening in your life.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:84%
By going within, by establishing
this practice of triggering

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
emotional traumas
and releasing them

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and understanding where beliefs
might be getting in your way,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
these are the
subconscious beliefs

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we're
not quite aware of.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
We want to clear out
all those conflicts

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and find real clarity inside.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:10%
And when you can
really release all

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:10%
of the limiting beliefs
and emotional reactions,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:10%
that's when you
really start to align

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:10%
with that more expanded
nature of who we

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:10%
all truly are made of.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:10%
We are souls at our most
basic, and we are in a body.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not the opposite.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:84%
We weren't a body
that created a soul.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
We were a soul that
inhabits a body.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And so really understanding
how your soul works,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
why it came here, you know,
what it needs to accomplish

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:90%
can be very useful.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And any practice of going
within can get you there.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But for me, binaural
beats have always

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
been a very useful way of
getting past that surface

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.819 align:middle line:90%
kind of thoughts and emotions.

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the more useful
techniques that I learned

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:90%
was awareness of the heart.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was very, very fascinated
by all of the research done

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:90%
by HeartMath.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:10%
This is an institute
in California

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:10%
that's been scientifically
studying the heart for decades.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:10%
And what they've found--

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:10%
and this is for all of us,
all of us who have a heart--

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:10%
that it emits an
electromagnetic field

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:10%
that comes out of
the body like this,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:10%
and it's in the
shape of a torus.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
What they found is it
actually expands and contracts

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:90%
based on your emotional state.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So emotions like joy
or happiness, that'll

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:90%
create a very large field.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But emotions like
sadness or grief

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
or anger or greed,
emotions like that

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
will create a more
constricted field.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is important, because
our electromagnetic field

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
of the heart actually
expands and contracts.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:10%
And as it does that,
it has the ability

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:10%
to influence other
people around us.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, our brains have an
electromagnetic field too.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And people like to
think that the brain is

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in charge of everything.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's a
very important organ

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:90%
in the body, no doubt.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But the brain has a much
smaller electromagnetic field.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The heart is 60 times
greater than the brain's

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
in the electric
part of the field.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the emotional
part of the field,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:84%
the heart is 3,000 times
bigger than the brain.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine as it's
expanding and contracting

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that it's reaching some
rather far distances.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And this ability to influence
others is quite remarkable.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They've done
studies at HeartMath

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
where someone will be sitting
across the table from someone

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
else, and the one person
who's in on the experiment

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
is doing what's known as
a coherence technique.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, a coherence
technique is simply

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:84%
generating a feeling
of gratitude.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Not a thought of gratitude,
but a feeling of gratitude.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And the person who's
doing this is actually

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
able to influence the
heart rate variability

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and the brainwave state of
the person sitting across

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.580 align:middle line:84%
from them, bringing them
into a calmer state.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And so as we're walking
around in the world

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and interacting
with others, this

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
is going on, whether
we realize it or not.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts are influencing
the people around us.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can pay
attention, and we know

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
who those people are who maybe
make us feel uncomfortable

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and those others who make us
feel very good and welcome.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
interesting to note.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But along with noting what
is going on in other people's

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
heart fields, it's most
useful to pay attention

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
to what's going on in
your own heart field.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Your own heart field
is the only one

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have the ability
to manage directly,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and you do it by learning to
manage your emotional state.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea of generating
feelings of gratitude,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:84%
for me this was
very difficult. I

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
knew how to think of
things I was grateful for,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
but generating a
feeling was different.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I seem to be one
of those people--

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and there may be many
of us out there--

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
who learned how to shut down
my feelings in order to protect

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:90%
myself from being hurt.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I lost the ability

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to generate at will these
really good types of feelings.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to
practice for a while.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pieces
of advice I got

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
was to recall things from my
past that I was grateful for.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I remembered back to
when I was six years old.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
My mother had taken
in a stray dog,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and that dog was a girl
dog, and it was pregnant.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And it proceeded to give birth
to puppies underneath my bed.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very
magical kind of moment

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:84%
for me, all of this
wiggly life coming

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to fore underneath my bed.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this memory
of this experience

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
caused me to feel these kind
of flickers of gratitude

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
in my heart.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
practiced this feeling,

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:90%
the more I felt it grow.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
It's this sort of
warm kind of energy

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that you feel in your heart.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you really
focus on it, you

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
can feel it expand
around your body.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And all of us can do this.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Say, in a line at a
bank or a grocery store

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
where maybe some people
are in a bad mood

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's taking
too long, when

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I imagine my heart
expanding around

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
my body with these
good feelings,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I can see people's mood change.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:10%
And so this can be very useful
to just try in your own life.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:10%
It's fascinating to read
about this kind of research,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:10%
but applying it in
our lives is what

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:10%
I find to be the most useful way
to kind of use this information

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:10%
to help myself and also others.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And I call this the
ultimate golden rule.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, how we
want to treat others

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:90%
as we would like to be treated.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ultimate
golden rule is

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
placing this kind of
self-love, these loving

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
feelings in your heart, knowing
that it's affecting people

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:90%
around you in positive ways.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And so if all, all
humans on the planet

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
or even the majority of us
can learn how to do this,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.255 align:middle line:84%
imagine how our
world might change.

00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
This idea of feeling gratitude
is really a beautiful way

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to think about this
idea of loving yourself.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I know when I grappled
with that concept,

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
it was very challenging for me
to think about directing love

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:84%
towards myself, because
many of us, when we're

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
very young usually, we
try to protect ourselves

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:90%
from things that happen.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:84%
In my case, my parents,
my mother and father,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
were divorced at
a very young age.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And they involved
me and my brothers

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
very directly in this
decision by sitting us down

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
when I was seven years old and
asking us, which parent would

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:90%
you like to live with?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
They asked us to
make that choice.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now at this time, my father had
been in Vietnam for two years,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't really
know him that well,

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:90%
because he hadn't been around.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was a
very easy decision.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, of course I
want to live with my mother.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I decided in that moment
that I didn't need my father.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Now at that moment, it
felt like the very thing

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:10%
I needed to do to
keep myself to be

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:10%
strong to not miss him and feel
so sad that he wasn't around.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But what I effectively
ended up doing

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
was shutting down my
ability to receive love

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:90%
from men, basically.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And so this worked fine when I
was a child, but as I got older

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to get into
relationships with others,

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I had built this
wall around my heart,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
a wall I didn't even
realize existed.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:10%
And it's when I started
meditating, especially

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:10%
when I started doing Sufi
heart rhythm meditation where

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:10%
we started to put a lot
of awareness on the heart,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:10%
and we did this by
imagining our breath was

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:10%
moving in and out of our heart.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Just that simple
act alone triggered

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.875 align:middle line:84%
these feelings of
abandonment, of being alone,

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
of having no one
there, and despair,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
where it came from.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
eventually-- it wasn't quick,

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:90%
this can take a little time--

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:90%
that I had done it to myself.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And we all do this.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
When we're rejected as
children from our peers,

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe from an abusive parent,
or maybe a teacher or minister

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
says something in
a certain way that

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:84%
hurts us and we
don't understand--

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and I call these baby wounds,
because they happen to us

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
before we can really
have the bigger

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
picture of maybe why a parent
or teacher said a certain thing.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They're wounds inside that
happened before we understood

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
what was going on, and
we set up little systems

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:90%
to protect ourselves.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And so as adults, as
grown-ups, it is very useful

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to go in and understand
maybe if you're

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
having issues in
relationships, or maybe you're

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
having an issue where you can't
hold down a steady job, what

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:84%
did you potentially do
when you were very young

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
and didn't realize how it
might affect you later in life?

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
It can be called an
abandonment wound,

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:90%
a universal abandonment wound.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
We all seem to
create these reasons

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
for not being good
enough, for not

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
being deserving,
any of those things

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
that we want to
have in our lives.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And these are very often
subconscious beliefs

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that hold us back, and other
times they're very conscious.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But all of them are related
to things that we probably

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:90%
didn't mean to do to ourselves.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very useful
to go within, find out

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
what those things are in your
own life, and release them.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of
things can really set

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
you free to really manifest
the things that you

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:90%
want to have in your life.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy, especially
in relationships

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of issue, to
blame others for our problems.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It's always something
else beyond our control.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Now in psychology, there's
something called locus

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
of control, internal or
external locus of control.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And internal locus
of control people

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
believe that their actions,
their beliefs, their thoughts,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and their behaviors have an
influence on their unfolding

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But external locus
of control people,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
they think that everything
is fate or destiny,

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:84%
that there's
nothing they can do,

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that the world will deliver
to them whatever it will,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're just a
victim of all of this.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But in relationship,
it can be very useful

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're triggered somehow by
something that someone else is

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
doing to not blame
the other person,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:84%
but to look inside yourself and
wonder, what is inside of me

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:90%
that's causing that trigger?

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Why am I responding to
this particular behavior

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:90%
in this way?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And so by focusing on the
inner world, lots of things

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:90%
can change in the outer world.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And this happened for me.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize
really the extent

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of how this could go until
I started meditating.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I did have a relationship
I wasn't satisfied with.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I did have a job I
wasn't satisfied with.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a location
that I wasn't satisfied.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, how could I
change all of those things?

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was very challenging
to think about making

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
all of those changes.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
going within and I

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
started to release all
of these limiting beliefs

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and these old traumas,
I didn't realize that

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
by cleaning up my inner
world, by really developing

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and cultivating that
peaceful inner sanctum,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
then my outer world
started to change.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.930 align:middle line:90%
All by itself.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It was completely amazing
how all of this took place.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And I've met other people--

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not alone.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I tell other people
this and they

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
will say the same thing
happened to them, that when

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
they started to focus
on their inner world

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that everything in
their outer world

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:90%
started to shift on its own.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And this even extended to issues
with my daughter, that teenager

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:90%
I was having troubles with.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:90%
I used to want to fix her.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I would want to
talk to her teachers

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and straighten her friends out
and change what clothes she

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%
was wearing, and all of that.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But when I started focusing on
my inner world and didn't worry

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
about her anymore--

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of course, I still worried,
but I didn't actively

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
try to make changes
in her life--

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
she started to make changes
in her life on her own.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we all kind of
set these templates for others

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
to follow.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Somehow I believe it's related
to that electromagnetic field

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
When my electromagnetic
field gets smooth

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm around my daughter,
hers automatically

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%
starts to get smoother.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so again, this
ultimate golden rule.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
By focusing on ourselves
and creating that self-love,

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:84%
we end up helping
others in ways that

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
are so mysterious, but
obvious once they take place.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And these synchronicities
are fascinating,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes these
things will happen,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and we like to call
them coincidences.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we're
looking for an answer

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
to a vexing problem,
and then suddenly you

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
see a billboard that has a
word on it that triggers,

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, that's the
solution, many of us

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:90%
call that a coincidence.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But really, a better
word is synchronicity.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung used this word
in his therapy work.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And these are things
that happen that maybe

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
are related in ways that we
can't imagine from our place.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But when we start to realize
that the universe is working

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
for us, and when we can create
a resonance, for example,

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of positivity and love
and gratitude, all of that

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a beacon
that is radiating

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of feelings.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And the universe has no
choice but to line up

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
with that resonance.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:84%
By creating that
within yourself,

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
you open up this
opportunity for the universe

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:84%
to deliver to you what it
is that you're seeking.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
But you must pay attention.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a joke I like to
tell where a man was drowning

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean, and he prays to
God, God, will you help me?

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And God doesn't answer.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And a boat goes by
and he says, hey,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:90%
would you like us to help you?

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Throws him a life raft.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:90%
He says, no, no, no.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting for God.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Someone else comes by.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Hey, here.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
A helicopter with a rope.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting for God.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:90%
He ends up drowning.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
He gets to heaven and
says, God, what happened?

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I was calling for you.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.255 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, what do
you think that boat was?

00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
that helicopter was?

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So our expectation of
how things should show up

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily how
things will show up.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
seems to know best.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just
find this trust

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and find this sort of
flow with the universe

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
we energetically

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:84%
are an integral part
of it, all of us

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
together form one collective
mind, and each of us

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%
is an integral piece of it.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is our personal
responsibility

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to really maintain
our energy so that it

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is compatible with the rest
of that collective mind.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.820 align:middle line:84%
One thing that really
fascinated me when

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I was doing all of the reading
about alternative spirituality

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is that I also read a lot
about our alternative history,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was convinced
as a young child

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
that our ancient history
was not complete.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone learns, at
least in America,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
about those Giza pyramids
in our ancient history,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and they tell us that they were
built by pharaohs as burial

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:90%
terms by thousands of slaves.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But then when they try to
recreate the engineering

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
feats of the Great Pyramid
today, they can't equal it.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
They can't align it to the
four directions the way

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:03.750 align:middle line:90%
it's aligned.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They can't stack the blocks
as closely as they're stacked.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, none
of us today really

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
can explain how those
pyramids were built.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we think we're so
advanced technologically.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So this immediately
told me many,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
many years ago as a
young person that we

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
must have had some technology
that we've forgotten,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that somehow technology used
to exist on Earth that we

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:90%
no longer know how to activate.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And so at first, I
thought this must

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
have been bigger machines
or somehow better tools

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have anymore.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that I came across
that makes so much sense to me

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is that these pyramids were
built using sound or vibration,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and that by somehow using
the human voice or some kind

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
of instrument, they
were able to alter I

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
guess the matter of stones
into something more malleable

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that was either lighter
or easier to use or shape.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, this
alteration in frequency

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
was a skill that
was known to humans

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:90%
who lived here on planet Earth.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:10%
And it fascinates
me that this is

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:10%
found all over the planet,
these kinds of engineering feats

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:10%
that we can't equal today.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at these,
you find that many of them

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:10%
are aligned to stars or
different constellations

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:10%
in our skies.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
This also tells me that our
ancient ancestors knew things

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
that we don't give
them credit for.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of this
can also be related

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:10%
to spirituality, because
way back in those times,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.005 align:middle line:10%
they knew many of the concepts
that we hear about today,

00:25:47.005 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:10%
that we're just
starting to hear about,

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:10%
that we're made of
one consciousness,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:10%
that mind existed before matter.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.140 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of things used
to be common knowledge.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And our more advanced
academic types

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
like to say that our
ancient ancestors maybe

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
weren't as smart
as we are today,

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
but I would like to
offer that maybe,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:84%
just maybe they were a
little smarter in some ways.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.710 align:middle line:10%
And these ancient sites around
the world are perfect evidence.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I love when people take
time to study and learn more

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
about these ancient structures,
because it informs us

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
on how we should
be moving forward

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:90%
with our collective world today.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I encourage anyone who's
listening to find that hope,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:84%
because we've taken a
wrong turn in our society,

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're in the process
of correcting that turn.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And that turn can really
be attributed to this idea

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:90%
of materialist science.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:84%
The idea that only the
physical world exists

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is actually a theory,
but somehow that theory

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:84%
has come to be known as truth,
especially in our secular

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
society that has kind
of taken religion out

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of the equation
for many reasons,

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
because there are some problems
with organized religion

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:90%
that many people have found.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But in doing that, we've
kind of thrown the baby out

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:90%
with the bathwater.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.500 align:middle line:84%
We've thrown out this
idea of spirituality.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And by bringing back
the idea that we

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
are more than our
physical bodies,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that we do not exist only from
birth to death and nothing

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
more, that there's a
grander reason for all

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
of us being here,
this kind of idea

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
can bring much
hope to many of us.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can access
this by going within.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to wait for
scientists to get around

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.945 align:middle line:84%
to telling us that
mind is powerful,

00:27:36.945 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:90%
that this is a good thing.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:90%
We can find out for ourselves.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:84%
By creating any practice of
going within-- and again,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
sound can be very
useful for those of us

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
in the West who have
trouble quieting our minds,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:84%
especially in the secular
world where we're not

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
used to thinking
of a higher power

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
greater influence.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you go within
and quiet the mind

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and get behind all
of those thoughts

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and emotions and that despair
and those triggers that we all

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
have, you find there
is something greater,

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and you are connected to it.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:10%
And I guarantee anyone
who takes the time

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:10%
to really find the
techniques that

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:10%
work for them will find this.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And this connection
to something greater

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:84%
is such an antidote to
all of this in our world,

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
because the materialist
science that

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:84%
has infiltrated
our secular world

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
has stripped all
meaning and purpose.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
They've told us we're just
chemical zombies walking around

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:84%
with this illusion
that we're conscious.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It sends me into an
existential crisis.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, then why
do I even bother to think?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's no wonder
that so many people,

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:84%
if that's what they
believe is true,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
are turning to this
kind of despair.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so finding that
connection to something

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
greater, whatever
you want to call it--

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
the universe, the force,
whatever word you want to use.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:90%
If god is uncomfortable--

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I know god was
uncomfortable for me,

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and I prefer the word universe.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:90%
But that is a greater power.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
you can imagine

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is that you are a piece
of that greater power.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Think about the philosophy that
we're all part of one mind.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.020 align:middle line:84%
We can come to that
level of understanding

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that we are creator
beings and that we

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
are responsible
ultimately for what's

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.260 align:middle line:90%
going around in this world.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the despair we
see is really a reflection

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that many of us have
despair in our inner worlds.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And if our inner
worlds start to get

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
more aligned with peaceful
kinds of feelings,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that's when the outer
world will catch up.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And so don't despair,
because each of us

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:50.280 align:middle line:84%
has a role to play by really
finding that unique spark that

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
makes us who we are and
causing that to radiate

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:90%
to the world around us.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:84%
No soul will be left behind,
and we are all in this together.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.990 align:middle line:90%
