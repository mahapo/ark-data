00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:84%
ALEX GREY: Various works of
art have been known to depress

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:90%
the autoimmune system.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
They made a scientific study
of finding out the strength

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of the immune system
before going into

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
see "The Exorcist,"
for example, and then

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:90%
after a person came out.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And just like any kind
of depressing situation

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:10%
can sometimes lower our immune
response, certain works of art

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:10%
can do that as well.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And so if there are
works of art that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
can depress our
autoimmune function,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
there are also

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
artworks that can
bolster or strengthen

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:90%
our autoimmune function.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And here, we get
into the idea of art

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of healing force.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And so my idea is that
some of these energetically

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
charged works of art that
show the light working

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.526 align:middle line:84%
through the body and
that the light is keyed

00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
with some sacred
understanding of life

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.555 align:middle line:84%
and a connection with
spirit, and that these

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
elicit a positive
and somewhat healing

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
response in the unconscious
that people look at the imagery

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and access the
dimension of reality

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:90%
that the work was inspired by.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they're most
always depictions

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of mystical experiences,
or vision states

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that occurred to
me, and that then

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to portray in the
most direct way possible.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And so if they do their
job, most of the time,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to bring the viewer
toward a fuller, richer,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
deeper, higher moment, peak
experience, mystical experience

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
of reality that reinforces
the reason for living--

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:90%
that life is worth living.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:90%
We can love each other.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:90%
We can help each other.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
We can see the fabric of
reality as the expression of God

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:90%
that it is.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We can see deeply into
the catastrophe of life,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:42.102 align:middle line:84%
as some call it, and see
the hand of spirit working.

00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you provide
little oases of meaning

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and sacred understanding
for people,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
it's a way to strengthen and
encourage the development

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and evolution of consciousness
within that person,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
the viewer who's seeing
the works of art.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way, in the same
way that I've appreciated

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
the sacred art of
previous cultures

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of access
to higher reality

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that they provide--
this kind of portals

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
into the mystic reality and the
great and boundless, beautiful,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:84%
compassionate sensibilities
that are expressed

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
through this
religious literature

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:90%
and through the religious art.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
For a contemporary
sensibility that's

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
outside of the denominations
and looking for a more

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
universal kind of
spiritual meaning,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to make
works that resonate

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of sensibility.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I put the
light around the bodies--

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
as to reinforce the
light around all of us.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Many artists would
deny or look askance

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
at the idea that's what they're
doing is a sacred activity.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They'd find it laughable
or silly, you know?

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:90%
They're making art.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
This is-- they're
showing it in a gallery.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
They're not showing it in
a religious institution

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:90%
or cultural center like that.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:10%
And some people
are even offended

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:10%
at the idea of "the spiritual."

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And in art in New
York, in many ways,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:10%
this is like the
spiritual trenches,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:10%
here-- in the spiritual
war or battlefield

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:10%
that's going on for the
consciousness of humanity.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have the deeply
cynical non0believing folks.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Mostly they're sensible
and rational people

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
who have just never had
a mystical experience.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And they are speaking the truth.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They think it's
a lot of hogwash.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And if it hasn't
happened to them.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
They're being accurate
in telling their truth.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps they
went to art school.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they like to draw.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they like the
art game-- artwork

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that's more looking into the
marketability of its itself

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
or how it can position
itself stylistically

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
within the season,
the art season.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of
intentions, you might say,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
are not directed toward
bringing forth the sacred.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
These similar kinds of
experiences of the higher

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.030 align:middle line:84%
realms-- they basically are
seeing that which we think

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of as our separate self
in an environment that is

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by separate objects.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.415 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhas have a
beautiful word for it--

00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
independent arising,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:90%
that all is interdependent.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And one can't
separate themselves

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
from the whole of the cosmos.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So even though in our little ego
minds we walk around thinking,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm me, in my little
world, and everything else

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is outside of it
and sort of is--

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to safeguard
yourself from everything.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're one
with everything.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't be
here if you weren't.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
just revealing a more

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:90%
basic and primordial truth.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to
see not only are

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
we creatures of the physical
or mental dimensions,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:84%
but we're creatures of a
completely transcendental

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
dimension as well,
beyond all representation

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:90%
and beyond birth and death.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
These are the states that
are damn hard to depict

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
as an artist, but
are the essence

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical experience,
the transcendence of space

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and time, the ineffableness,
undescribableness of it--

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
a generally positive, kind
of, and blissful, but awesome,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
the mysterium tremendum, as
Rudolf Otto, in the "Idea

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy" talked about it.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's not just
flowers and birdsongs.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:90%
God is an earthquake, as well.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It's terrifying.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It's-- you are one with the same
force that provides the spiral

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
arms of the galaxy, that
universal creativity

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:90%
is also what you are as well.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when the mystic eye
is opened and sees that,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:90%
a person is forever changed.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are there certain
events that occur in one's

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:90%
life that change everything.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:10%
I think falling in
love is one of them.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And for me, taking
psychedelics was a major thing

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:90%
that changed everything.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be
that I fell in love

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and took psychedelics
on the same night,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
as I met my wife, really, under
my first experience of LSD.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.205 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And that was 26 years ago.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.985 align:middle line:84%
We're still together, still
ever more deeply in love.

00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that LSD provided
a, like Aldous Huxley said, it

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
kind of cleansed my
doors of perception

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
so that I saw through the
nihilistic surface realm.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
The material world became
transparent to a potently

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
meaningful and altogether
sacred understanding

00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:04.445 align:middle line:84%
of life-- something that I had
no way of preparing myself for.

00:13:04.445 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
For the couple of years
previous to my taking LSD,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
which I took when
I was 21, I'd been

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
doing a number of
performance artworks

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:90%
that had to do with polarities.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.862 align:middle line:84%
And I'd shaved
half of my hair off

00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'd gone to the
North Magnetic Pole.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd done a variety
of strange works that

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
exploring dark side,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
light side-- various kinds
of ideas of the rational,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive, hemispheres of
the brain, things like that.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the LSD experience,
I had closed my eyes

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and I was in kind of
a spiralic tunnel.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the dark and
moving toward the light.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:84%
There was a kind of
a-- it was a Mother

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
of Pearl, kind of shimmery,
pearlescent, iridescent kind

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:90%
of walls of this tunnel.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the dark.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And there was this kind
of curl of this tunnel.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
just around the edge

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:90%
was where this was coming from.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And as it cast the light
on the walls of the tunnel,

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I could see that,
from the very bright,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
it went through all the
different shades of gray

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:90%
into complete darkness.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And so this spiralic dynamic
tunnel of being in the dark

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and moving toward the
light became a way for me

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
to integrate the opposites.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It was what I called
a polar unity spiral.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all the things
that seemed like in conflict

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and opposition in
my sensibility found

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:90%
a way of becoming each other.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it was an experience
of profound union inside.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And it pointed toward
a reality that I

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:90%
barely could imagine existed.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And coupled as it was
with meeting Allison,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.855 align:middle line:84%
she was the only other person
at this party that was tripping.

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
It brought us together and I
called her up the next night

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know,
uh, that was pretty

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:90%
incredible what happened to me.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:18.195 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, oh,
I've done that many times.

00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
can we get together

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and talk about it things?

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And so she was happy
to get together.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been
together ever since.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
catalyst in many ways.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It opened me up to
an understanding

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to reality
than just the physical realm.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And it brought my
wife and I together.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:90%
So to me, it was very important.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, the numerous
times that we've done journeys

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:84%
together, they've brought
forth significant visions

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that-- I have to say,
this painting "Theologue,"

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.229 align:middle line:84%
came directly out of
an LSD experience.

00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
I was wearing a blindfold and
sitting in a Lotus position.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
under the horizon.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:10%
And I could see this
electric perspective grid.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:10%
It was just, like,
going on forever.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.870 align:middle line:84%
But it also seemed
like, oddly enough,

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I was projecting the
perspective grid.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was surrounding
me at the same time.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was an experience
of projecting and being

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by your projection.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
That is this odd quality
that the mind has.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
When we dream, we
dream in this sort

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
of in imagined 3D
space-- or 4D space,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:90%
that we're walking through.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:84%
We find buildings
and things like that.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, in our minds,
we're able to create space.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And so this painting points
to this strange capacity

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:84%
of perception to
be simultaneously

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
the cone of vision
and the vanishing

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.523 align:middle line:90%
point of the composition.

00:18:39.523 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
"Theologue" is this
dialogue with God.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a long subtitle.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Union of
Human and Divine Consciousness,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Weaving the Fabric
of Space and Time,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
in Which the Self and its
Surroundings are Embedded."

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.432 align:middle line:84%
So we're projecting the space
that we're surrounded by.

00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a very odd thing
that the mind does.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:90%
There's nowhere out there.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:84%
We're having this
experience in our minds.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are fabricating this
space that we're surrounded by.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Very curious.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
this painting's about.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to be my
most popular painting.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
We've sold thousands and
thousands of posters of this.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Numerous people
have come up to me

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and said, man, I had an
experience that was like that.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell
anybody about it.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:90%
It was so weird.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:90%
But it was just like that!

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And so now they have a thing.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:90%
They can say, I'm not insane.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
He had it too.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And so numerous people
have come up to me

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:90%
and told me about this.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's not alone.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just one
transpersonal experience

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
that bears relationship
with numerous other people's

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
transpersonal experiences.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And so tripping has-- it's, by
far, not the only way that I

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:90%
get imagery to work with.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this "World
Soul" sculpture--

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:44.052 align:middle line:84%
I was just waiting for a train,
basically the subway train.

00:20:44.052 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was tired after
a day of teaching.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And poof, there on the subway
kind of just sidewalk area,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I saw this being that had
wings wrapped around it.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And it had multiple
eyes and things.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It obviously wasn't just
like the homeless guy

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:90%
that was right next to it.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
totally on the natch.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But that psychedelics, I
think, have influenced or bent

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
my sensibility so that
it's sort of cracked open

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
the doors of perception,
or cleansed the lens

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:84%
so that the membrane
between the visionary realm

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and the physical
realm are a little--

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that line is less hard.
You know?

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a little
more permeable.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And so numerous paintings were
influenced by specific vision

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:10%
states that were accessed
in theogenic voyages,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and numerous paintings
came out of just

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:10%
a grace, just a vision that got
plopped into my consciousness.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
strong relationship

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:90%
between art and Shamanism.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:10%
The shamans job is
to journey inward

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:10%
and to access sort
of the lower worlds

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:10%
and the middle realms
and the upper worlds,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.433 align:middle line:10%
and these visionary
dimensions of reality.

00:22:32.433 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They're going there
for the sake of healing

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:90%
once they've become shamans.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
shamans in training.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But when they're working
for the good of the healing

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
of their community, or a
particular people who have

00:22:52.670 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
some kind of soul illness
or other kind of ailment,

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
in this way, maybe
it's stretching

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
it to say that the
artists, in general,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
are oriented toward the
same kind of shamanic quest.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that at least
for a number of artists, they

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic model, of the one that
journeys inward and then brings

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
out certain truths that maybe
provide some kind of healing

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
or meaningful understanding
for the community,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
this is sort of a model of
a kind of sacred function

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:84%
that a number of
artists can relate to.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And those in performance art
and other kinds of works where

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they're looking specifically
into the visionary realms

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and bringing out the numerous
kind of visionary art type

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.596 align:middle line:84%
painters and things like that,
would feel very comfortable

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
in having adopted the model
of the shaman, I guess,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
as an archetype for how to
view what they're doing.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:84%
If they're trying to
get out of the box

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
of contemporary
artist-- one that

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:84%
is making art to fit in with
the trajectory of art history

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
as it's been explained
in the university

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and in the arts school.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Most art schools don't
go into Shamanism 101,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, or art schools.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
They just don't deal with this--
how to access your unconscious

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and bring it forward.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, meanwhile, they're
probably home getting high

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:90%
and learning it for themselves.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
the context, they

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
don't have the cultural
context in which

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
to view what they're doing
as some kind of sacred quest.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And numerous tribal, or in
theogenically based cultures,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
they've got a way for
people to get into the job

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
of becoming a shaman.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's why I stopped short
of calling artists shamans.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a great respect
for the shamanic profession.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It just can't be thrown
around willy nilly.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult and
arduous kind of thing.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:16.335 align:middle line:84%
It's like a real yogi
going into the cave

00:26:16.335 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and meditating for a long time
and suffering their privations

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and encountering their demons
and all of the rest of this.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It can bring people
close to physical death,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
in some of these arduous vision
quests that they need to go on

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So the Western art student who
gets out and paint pictures

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and things like that and
calls himself a shaman,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I just-- that
doesn't ring right.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:10%
But if they are accessing
the visionary realm

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:10%
and they're journeying and
are intending, at least,

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:10%
to bring benefit
to their community

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:10%
through their visions
and things like that,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.430 align:middle line:10%
I'd say that there's
a strong relationship

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:10%
between the profession
of the shaman

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:10%
and the profession
of the artist.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's numerous events,
like we've spoken of-- rock

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
shows, and things like that.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely different
kinds of events that

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:90%
are more tribal than others.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at the
Burning Man festivals,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and at the rave and trance
party kind of situations,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:90%
where people will go.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:84%
They'll probably be in an
altered state of consciousness.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And their reality is
modeled by and influenced

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
by either the
music, the artwork,

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
the various kinds of
things that have been

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:90%
provided in those environments.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they're making
environments to journey

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:90%
in for fellow journeyers.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And so in situations like that,
and also in the sort of fever

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
pitch of certain rock
concerts, the ecstatic function

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and the psychopomp
kind of function

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
of the shaman for
their culture--

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that is to bring forth a
sacred understanding of reality

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:84%
in the fever of the
crescendos of Jimi Hendrix,

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
or of Tool, or of various
kinds of amazing rock

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and roll performers.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
They elicit this intangible,
mysterious, sacred reality,

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and in the same way that
perhaps dances around a fire,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
or the taking of mushrooms
that was lorded over

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
by the curanderos, or the
different kind of shaman who

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
would administer
Ayahuasca to their group,

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:84%
They're helping to control
an altered state of reality

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
by singing their icaros, their
songs of the soul that will

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:84%
keep people centered toward
their healing reality

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and toward their love
of life and healing,

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a relationship
between what's going on

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:84%
in these sort of tribal cultures
that are shamanically based

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
in their understanding
of sacred reality,

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and the new kind of the
tribalism that has come forward

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
in the raves or the rock
shows, or Burning Man,

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.636 align:middle line:84%
and various performance artists'
kinds of works and things

00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
like that, and the kind
of nihilist sensibility

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that emerges from a rational
point of view that has not

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:84%
experienced the sacred, and
perhaps has been disappointed

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in love, and perhaps has seen
the depth of cruelty and malice

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that humanity can bring
forward onto the world,

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:90%
onto each other.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's deeply looked
into the trauma of human history

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:84%
might sensibly become
a nihilist if they

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:90%
had no idealism to guide them.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the catastrophe
that humanity

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:84%
has wrought upon the web of
life in the 20th century--

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
industrial poisons and
various things that

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:84%
have brought numerous
species to extinction,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and perhaps threatens our own.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a sensible
response to life.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think a
lot of the punk rock bands

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and various artists who are lost
in a dark, hellish, despairing

00:31:54.550 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and traumatized space
are still making

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
the soul perceptible,
even though it's

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.375 align:middle line:90%
a nihilist point of view.

00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:84%
It has a truth to it,
and an emotional value

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:90%
that is worthy of expression.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is a caustic
and destructive force

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.670 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:49.136 align:middle line:84%
If we're only immersed in the
recognition of the foulness

00:32:49.136 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and suffering of
life, we've only

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:90%
grasped the first Noble Truth.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Life is suffering, or life is
perpetual unsatisfactoryness--

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:90%
however you want to put it.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a fairly
nihilist statement.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:90%
But it was from the Buddha.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And so fortunately, there
were four Noble Truths.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And the whole sense of the
sort of nihilist point of view

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:84%
only grasps hold
of the hell realms,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't bring us
forward into a way

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that we can view our
lives as a journey.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:84%
In the nihilist point of
view, there's no exit,

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:55.925 align:middle line:84%
and we're trapped in a
miserable hell realm.

00:33:55.925 --> 00:33:59.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying, it
has a certain validity.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
a limited understanding

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:84%
of what life can be-- valid,
important to recognize,

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:84%
but important to
move from, as well.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, they talk
about the putrescence

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:90%
bringing regeneration.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this darkened cathonic
energy that comes forward

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:40.040 align:middle line:84%
in nihilist works of various
kinds-- you can look at music,

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:47.290 align:middle line:84%
you can look at painting, you
can look at cinema, wherever

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:52.630 align:middle line:84%
you want to find
expressions of this kind

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of darkened and
hopeless, flattened,

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.330 align:middle line:84%
flat-land sensibility,
flat land in that

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:84%
there's no depth in meaning,
no higher awareness of things.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's all just the surface
of the material realm.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And the nihilist takes
the material world

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:84%
as its only world,
it's only dimension.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And because therefore it's
collapsed any potential

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:34.080 align:middle line:84%
for finding the sacred, since
it's always only surface,

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:90%
then life becomes meaningless.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is a kind of a
trance as well that people

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:90%
can get locked into.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I was locked into it for a
certain phase of my life.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I just
love art in general--

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:84%
just that there is
such a wonderful thing

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that humans have always
done, as make art,

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:90%
make music, make something.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Create.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so excited
that it exists at all.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just like falling
in love and finding

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that there is actually
somebody in the world

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:90%
who cares for you that much.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.950 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting.
You know?

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And that there's art
museums, and that there's

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.300 align:middle line:90%
artists-- most of all, artists.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And it really is the individuals
that anymore draw me in.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Michelangelo is my
all time favorite artist.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.340 align:middle line:90%
One cannot rival him.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like the mountain
of Beethoven, you know?

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You can go a certain
way up that mountain,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you've traversed
a little bit of it.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, it's
an unscalable mount.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Mount
Everest of art.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Michelangelo was an architect,
the most divine draftsman.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
He was a painter extraordinaire
and an unbelievable sculptor.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:90%
He wrote sonnets.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:38.460 align:middle line:84%
He was this kind of
Renaissance human being

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that encompassed his culture
and brought it forward.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:84%
He embodied it and pointed
in a new direction.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And as his last pieta would
have done Brancusi proud.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a work of a
modernist sensibility.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here is a gothic
character who was deeply

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:84%
immersed in his Catholicism,
And then started

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:84%
to hear the Neoplatonic
points of view

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:84%
about the soul and its ability
to be expressed through art,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and the immortality
of the soul, and how

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
different various
religions were carrying

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:90%
some of the same truths.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Neoplatonists
were espousing

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:36.250 align:middle line:84%
such dangerous
heresies at that time

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that all religions were
one, and things like that,

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and that God was
directly perceptible.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.090 align:middle line:84%
One didn't have to go
through an intermediary,

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%
like a priest, and
things like that.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So the understanding that there
was a mystical reality that you

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:04.800 align:middle line:84%
could directly apprehend was
at the basis of Michelangelo's

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.260 align:middle line:90%
profound works.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:84%
It was coming through a
Christian sensibility.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So "The Last Judgment"
features Christ in the center

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of the mandala, in a
swirl, a cascade of flesh

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that Christ was mirroring
in his position, like this.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
It was like he was
a Daoist master.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And some have
interpreted his gaze

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.730 align:middle line:84%
as the wrathful Lord making
this judgment call on the souls.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But I've always felt if you look
at his face, it's very benign.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not wrathful in the least.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's compassionate.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It's sympathetic.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically saying,
some are a-coming up,

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and some are a-going down.
You know?

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's just kind of a swirl.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Heaven and hell.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is every minute/
every moment of our life

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:20.050 align:middle line:90%
is this cosmic swirl.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
My favorite artists
from every culture

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who brought
forth meaning and symbolism

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and mind-blowing
expansive, infinite nature

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.820 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual reality.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can find it
in the sacred art

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:90%
of all the different cultures.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the Hindu
philosophical portraits

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and things like that--
I mean, I always

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:84%
love seeing the portraits
of Krishna displaying

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:84%
his cosmic form, with
all the multiple heads

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and eyes and limbs and things.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:84%
These attempts to depict
the transcendental mystical

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:27.760 align:middle line:84%
visionary experience
are the types of artwork

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:90%
that really excite me.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can find them in the
Buddhist Thangka paintings,

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:84%
where the different dieties
or the mandalas are formed,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:47.670 align:middle line:84%
or the wrathful forms, or the
beatific and peaceful Buddhas

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:90%
are there.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Any artwork that's pointing at
this sort of visionary realm

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.330 align:middle line:84%
are some of my favorite,
favorite works of art.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Many of these artists
are anonymous.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Any artwork-- and most
times it's sacred art that's

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:84%
trying to depict this
reality, are things that I've

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:90%
always become more drawn to.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The symbolist painters
of the 19th century--

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:84%
there's an artist
named Jean Delville.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was called a
painter of astral forms.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And he also was
influenced by Theosophy.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And as an artist whose work
I feel strongly related to,

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
he had a specific kind
of mystical understanding

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.540 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And it came forward
in his artwork.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So Jean Delville has
been a particularly

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.065 align:middle line:90%
influential painter to me.

00:42:51.065 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of my
favorite painters, as well.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:84%
He's in, some ways,
regarded as, I guess,

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
a grade B painter-- I
don't know-- by some.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But to me, he's quite
a beautiful, amazing

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.220 align:middle line:84%
symbolist painter
who brought forward

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:18.600 align:middle line:84%
many of the understandings
of Theosophy in his artwork.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And he painted very
spiritual beings

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:84%
but that were not aligned
to a specific sacred art

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.920 align:middle line:84%
tradition, which is really
what I'm trying to do, as well.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, there was a
painter in the 20th century

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
named Pavel Tchelitchew.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was a painter
born in Russia,

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and came to Paris when the
Russian Revolution occurred.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And his family, which
was of a noble birth,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.300 align:middle line:90%
kind of became deposed.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:84%
They fled to the
hinterlands, and he

00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:84%
fled to Paris because he
wanted to become a young up

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and coming artist.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:05.290 align:middle line:84%
He met Picasso and Braque
and all of the rest

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.600 align:middle line:90%
of the bohemian scene, there.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind of
adopted by Gertrude

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Stein and Alice Toklas, and
some of those characters there.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And his most famous work
is "Hide and Seek," which

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.240 align:middle line:90%
is in the Museum of Modern Art.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite an
extraordinary painting.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It looks like both
a hand and a foot.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's really like a tree.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was immersed in
occultism and alchemy.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And he brought forward these
references quite intentionally

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:90%
in his painting.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:45:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, he was a very
unusual painter of his time.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:84%
In the '30s and '40s and
'50s, very few people

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:10.650 align:middle line:84%
were taking reference
points from alchemy, say.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And the occult was
not really where

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.290 align:middle line:90%
many artists were working.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:84%
He also devised a kind
of-- and I've never

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:84%
been able to find out
what was the direct cause

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.750 align:middle line:90%
of this influence.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But he had a kind
of x-ray vision

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that he was bringing forward
in his artwork that is very

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.360 align:middle line:90%
related to what I am doing.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was for
many of the same reasons.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.930 align:middle line:84%
He was piercing the veil of
material reality-- trying

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to show the living life that
was going on inside of people

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.890 align:middle line:84%
rather than strictly
focus on surfaces.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And so these were the same
inspirations that brought me

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to this kind of
spiritualized anatomy,

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.590 align:middle line:84%
which I'd started to do before
really becoming familiar

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:90%
with Tchelitchew's work.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But then I felt like,
my god, he's done it

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.270 align:middle line:90%
all-- when I had seen his work.

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, he
hadn't done it all.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that he's a very
strong influence on my work,

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and the artists whose work my
work could most be, I think,

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:41.650 align:middle line:84%
related to in the canon
of 20th century painters.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And so in my painting called
"Painting," which just shows

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.140 align:middle line:84%
a painter painting,
we have various kinds

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.020 align:middle line:84%
of artists in the
peanut gallery there

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that are influencing the
painter as they're painting.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And Delville is one of them,
and Tchelitchew is one of them.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:08.150 align:middle line:84%
William Blake is
a big one for me,

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because he was this independent
sensibility who, although he

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:19.100 align:middle line:84%
was influenced by
Christianity, his spirituality

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.800 align:middle line:90%
was quite idiosyncratic.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.410 align:middle line:90%
And he went it alone.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:32.360 align:middle line:84%
He did not kowtow to any kind
of artistic establishment,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and died a pauper, and is
celebrated with exhibits

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:84%
at the Tate and the
Metropolitan, now,

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and is beloved by
millions of people.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But he suffered for
his genius, I think,

00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:01.125 align:middle line:84%
and his unyielding
kind of character.

00:48:01.125 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And so he's also a great
archetype and an influence.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.420 align:middle line:90%
He loved Michelangelo.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I think Michelangelo,
to him, was

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.820 align:middle line:90%
his favorite artist, as well.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So Michelangelo is also in the
peanut gallery of the painter's

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.870 align:middle line:90%
painting anyway.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:84%
As well as Frida
Kahlo, who-- she's

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.160 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite
artists, as well.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Here is somebody who was
a troubled personality,

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:84%
but whose emotions
came through very

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.065 align:middle line:90%
strongly in her self-portraits.

00:48:39.065 --> 00:48:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And those, I think,
especially-- anyone

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.220 align:middle line:90%
can see this wounded deer.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a
human animal hybrid

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.870 align:middle line:90%
that's pierced by arrows.

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It's got the face of Frida,
but the body of a deer.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was
intensely vulnerable.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And she made her vulnerability
and depth of her emotions

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.560 align:middle line:84%
visible through
her self-portraits.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.230 align:middle line:84%
The great self-portrait
painters like Rembrandt,

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.010 align:middle line:84%
who's also one in the peanut
gallery of this painting,

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.340 align:middle line:90%
"Painting."

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Here was a person who
could paint a human soul.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.550 align:middle line:84%
There was something
unbelievable about his ability

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:90%
to render flesh.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it was
breathing and palpable.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The delicacy and the nuances
that you associate, say,

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:84%
with your grandmother's
hanging flesh-- Rembrandt

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.150 align:middle line:90%
could make it look real.

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And he had a very mysterious way
of drawing us into the works.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And for me, some of
his most powerful works

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.850 align:middle line:90%
are his self-portraits.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And those are ones that just--
you can peer right into him,

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's as though he's
standing before you.

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You can become the artist just
by losing yourself in the work.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And van Gogh was the same way.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Frida Kahlo was the same way.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:84%
They each made
these self-portraits

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that showed the depth of
their search for who they were

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and what they were, and brings
us right into that longing

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and search when we
look into their soul

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.640 align:middle line:84%
through looking into their
eyes of their self-portraiture.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So those are amazing
artists to me.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Hieronymus Bosch.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.340 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of the
last one that was

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:90%
in this painting of painting.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And he is kind of like the
granddaddy of visionary art.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:90%
His works are astonishing.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.130 align:middle line:90%
They're so jewel-like.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the architecture
that he put

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:84%
in "The Garden of
Earthly Delights"

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:84%
is still beyond
even Frank Gehry.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has done this
kind of weird fruit-animal

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:28.900 align:middle line:90%
hybrid architecture yet.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Not even the most
bizarre architects

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:37.100 align:middle line:84%
have come up with these similar
kind of jewel-like mindscapes

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.400 align:middle line:90%
that Bosch was dealing in.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.270 align:middle line:84%
He portrayed the heavens
and hells and the souls

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.890 align:middle line:90%
ascending to the hereafter.

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And he covered the gamut.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And he had an imagination
was unparalleled.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So all of those artists, I bow
in gratitude and recognition

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:14.660 align:middle line:84%
of their supreme contribution to
the enjoyment and the deepening

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.915 align:middle line:90%
and enrichment of humanity.

00:52:17.915 --> 00:52:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:32.295 align:middle line:84%
A sacred space is a place of
initiation into sacred reality.

00:52:32.295 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:42.970 align:middle line:84%
These ideas about
sacred reality change

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:90%
from culture to culture a bit.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And we find temples and
chapels and various pagodas

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and mandala sort of
forms, and the stupas,

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and various other kinds
of religious architecture

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.310 align:middle line:90%
throughout world culture.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We see the Great Pyramids
all of the various kinds

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.435 align:middle line:90%
of sacred architecture.

00:53:12.435 --> 00:53:15.200 align:middle line:90%


00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe that these
sacred spaces of initiation

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.850 align:middle line:84%
are specific to each
of these cultures,

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and key one into the
understand of the spirit

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.370 align:middle line:90%
that these cultures represented.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the 21 century,
and the third millennium,

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:47.750 align:middle line:84%
with a more global sensibility,
and emerging what I think

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:55.380 align:middle line:84%
of as world spirit, we have
an opportunity to create

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.050 align:middle line:90%
a kind of universal sacred art.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And it may seem a naive or
an idealistic kind of goal.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But informed by all
world sacred art

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and also the individual's
own experience

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:84%
of these mystical realms,
I believe it's possible

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that we can make various
kinds of sacred spaces

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that are not confined to
one religion or another,

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:84%
but speak to a more universal
spirituality for humanity.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.935 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to create
the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors.

00:54:40.935 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:90%


00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.930 align:middle line:84%
A sacred mirror is something
that I wouldn't just reflect

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:54.740 align:middle line:84%
your physical presence,
but would reflect

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.810 align:middle line:84%
your soul, as well,
or whatever you

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.930 align:middle line:90%
take to be your sacred element.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.630 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.480 align:middle line:84%
In this chapel, we
have the sacred mirrors

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that go through to the
physical, tangible material

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.190 align:middle line:84%
realm, the body and all
its anatomical features,

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system,
cardiovascular system,

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:25.710 align:middle line:84%
skeleton, all the things that
make up our physical body.

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the
socio-political realm

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of the individual, where we
have specific races and genders

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.420 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.870 align:middle line:84%
You put skin on a person,
and they're an individual.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:45.997 align:middle line:84%
Can we relate to and see
through the surfaces of the skin

00:55:45.997 --> 00:55:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to see how each individual
is a mirror of ourselves?

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.760 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the question,
and part of why these are set

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.380 align:middle line:90%
up in this kind of sequence.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.040 align:middle line:90%
You look through the body.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you look through
your socio-political identity.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it moves on to
the spiritual reality,

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:16.850 align:middle line:84%
or the archetypes of the
energies that surround us

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and that move through us,
and the specific religious

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:24.780 align:middle line:90%
archetypes the influence us.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:30.240 align:middle line:84%
These are elements
of our identity

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.470 align:middle line:90%
just as our physical body is.

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And so to take the body and
mind and spirit of an individual

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and go through that
sort of sequence,

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that's one aspect
of this chapel.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are the Sacred
Mirror Series.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the Progress
of the Soul paintings, that

00:56:50.010 --> 00:57:00.380 align:middle line:84%
go from an individual who's
praying to the act of finding

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:05.150 align:middle line:84%
a loved one, "The Beloved,"
and kissing, and lovemaking,

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and pregnancy, and birth, and
all the sequence in the journey

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:16.150 align:middle line:84%
of life-- bringing out
images like nursing

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and the different kind
of inter-relationship

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:25.370 align:middle line:84%
with the family, and
mostly emphasizing

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:27.920 align:middle line:90%
the connection of love.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me, is what
makes life worthwhile.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I want the chapel to
point to and underscore that

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:43.280 align:middle line:90%
which makes life worth living.

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And it will also have what I
call the World Prayer Wheel,

00:57:51.980 --> 00:58:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that will be a stained glass
globe, a geodesic sphere,

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:06.050 align:middle line:84%
of the earth that is
supported by prayers

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:09.740 align:middle line:84%
from all different
world spiritual paths.

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And that by turning it, one
can sort of turn the world.

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
sacred architecture

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that's about beings inside
of beings inside of beings.

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And the individual is
situated inside of shells

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:34.390 align:middle line:90%
of greater and greater being.

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And so what will happen when the
person turns the World Prayer

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Wheel-- they become more
world-centric in their

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.090 align:middle line:84%
identity, after they've gone
through this sort of body,

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.210 align:middle line:90%
mind, spirit.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Then they enter
into the collective

00:58:50.680 --> 00:59:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and see how we're all important
in making the world go around,

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and that we're also part of
one greater cosmic being.

00:59:05.480 --> 01:00:11.600 align:middle line:90%
