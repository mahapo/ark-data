00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1927, at the 5th
Solvay Conference on physics

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
in Brussels, Belgium, a new
proposal of mind over matter

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
was admitted to try to
resolve inexplicable behaviors

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:90%
on quantum mechanics.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:10%
With the greatest
minds in physics

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:10%
attending, such as Einstein,
Pauli, Dirac, Bohr, Heisenberg,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.100 align:middle line:10%
Curie, de Broglie, Schrodinger,
just to name a few,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:10%
the subject of consciousness and
the atomic world was at hand.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:10%
Heisenberg and Bohr approached
Einstein with a new theory

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:10%
that the minds of
the researchers

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:10%
were affecting the results
of the experiments.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
The mathematics
of predictability

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
were not repeatable
and reliable enough

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:90%
to explain what was happening.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Einstein could not
accept this at first

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
because it violated all
mathematical models.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Years later, he admitted
it was happening.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, "Anyone who
becomes seriously involved

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
in the pursuit of science
becomes convinced that there

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:84%
is a spirit manifest in the
laws of the universe, a spirit

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:90%
vastly superior to that of man."

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is not a mechanical
force, like gravity,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetism, or the
strong and the weak forces.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:90%
A spirit is consciousness.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So for Einstein to have made
his great transformation

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
can only mean that
something convinced him

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
that it was really happening,
that the universe is alive,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:90%
and we are part of it.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Did great powers hide
the truth about what

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
was discovered at the
conference because they

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
knew they could not
control us if we

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
knew the secret
powers of our minds

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and collective consciousness?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
"All matter originates
and exists only

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:90%
by virtue of a force.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
We must assume,
behind this force,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
is the existence of a
conscious and intelligent mind.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
This mind is the
matrix of all matter."

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck, the father
of quantum physics.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
The secret of mind
over matter was

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
known 18 years before the first
atomic blast at Trinity Site,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico, July 22nd, 1945.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Our current science
cannot handle consciousness.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Although some people like to
say quantum physics can explain

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, the fact of the
matter is that physics cannot

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:10%
deal with an experiment where
a human being is involved

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:10%
in the loop.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:10%
This goes back to the way
quantum physics was originally

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:10%
built, back in the 19
teens and '20s and '30s.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Whenever there's a
conscious observer present,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
he causes a collapse
of the wave function.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the wave function is
a mathematical construct

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that describes the
waviness of probabilities

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
of events at the quantum level.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics is a set
of equations that describe

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%
how this wave function behaves.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
When an observer looks
at an experiment,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
he caused the collapse
of this wave function.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:90%
He destroys information.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
It basically starts the
wave function from zero

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and things have
to start up again.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So an observer right
now has a chaotic effect

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
in trying to describe
or explain what

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
goes on when a person
is in the loop.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Our physics right
now is incomplete.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
We cannot deal with a
consciousness affecting other

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
physical objects
in an experiment.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know
how to deal with it.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So what you find is that
most physics experiments

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
keep observers out of the loop.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They'll put a scientist
outside the box.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
He gets to look in,
maybe, at the end

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:90%
to see what the results were.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But because his consciousness
collapses the wave function,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:90%
they don't let him in.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bull
in a China shop.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
He messes up their
predictions, and they

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to deal with it.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:10%
>> We live in a world today
where there's a hierarchy

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:10%
of power.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:10%
There are very powerful
people and there are people

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:10%
with virtually no power at all.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
What's very important from
a biological understanding

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is every human being is equally
powerful in their creative

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:90%
ability to shape the planet.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Then you say, well, if everybody
is equally powerful, then

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
how did other people
gain so much more power?

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And here's the joke.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:90%
They didn't gain any power.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
The reason they
became more powerful

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
is they took away
the power from us,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and that the evolution that
we're experiencing right now

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:90%
is to recover that power.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
entire population

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
is possessing such
power, there's

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
more of a likely better
resolution and harmony

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
than a world today where
only a few people are

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:90%
exercising their power.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And I really look
forward to that evolution

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
when we recover the
power we've always had,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:84%
which means going back and
reprogramming our belief

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
systems to own how
powerful we are.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Human intention can
significantly influence

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:10%
the properties of materials
and the nature of reality.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:10%
>> As early as 1957,
professor Hans Eysenck,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:10%
then chairman of the psychology
department at the University

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:10%
of London, wrote a letter,
insinuating that there was

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:10%
a gigantic conspiracy involving
some 30 major universities all

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:10%
over the world and hundreds
of highly respected scientists

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:10%
to silence the truth about
what we knew about the powers

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:10%
of human consciousness.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:10%
>> After the United States
Congress had access to the data

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:10%
from the Stanford Research
Institute and from universities

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:10%
all over the country
and over the world,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:10%
they were terrified of
what would happen if we all

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:10%
developed the
powers of our minds.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It was clear that we
could remote view,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
we could see into the
future, into the past.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
We could find missing
airplanes and anything

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine with our minds.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And they actually did a
smear campaign with the media

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to discredit what
they had discovered,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
want us to know how

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:90%
powerful our minds really are.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the language
of quantum communication?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
How does the
universe communicate

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
from subatomic particles,
wavelenghts, superstrings,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
atoms, planets to stars,
galaxies, and all living

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Is there a
communicative symphony

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
happening all the
time that remains

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:84%
invisible to our current
technology and awareness?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
What if we understood
its secret?

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
We would know how to talk to
the creator, nature, science,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and each other and
interstellar civilizations.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Are we in communication
before we meet in person?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
How do we, as human beings,
communicate with each other?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
How do we find our true
love, life partners,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
our sold matches, our families,
business partners, our careers,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:90%
teachers, and life purpose?

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And how do we find God?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, what's going on?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving you a message.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm really starting
to get worried

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:10%
that you haven't
call me back and I

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.744 align:middle line:10%
guess you're not leaving
me much of a choice.

00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
ahead and tell you

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
what I've been needing to
tell you via voicemail, even

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
though it makes me very
uncomfortable to do that.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, heart disease.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:10%
The body is not a separate
entity, all its different parts

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:10%
just acting alone.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:10%
There is a mind-body
interaction that

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:10%
has a lot to do with the
development of disease,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:10%
in general.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I just wanted to let you
know that I can barely, barely,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:90%
barely live without you.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.061 align:middle line:84%
I was paralyzed a couple
of days ago and I--

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.492 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:04.492 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I've never really had
the courage to tell you

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're the one for me
and I can't live without you.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, stress on the brain
will cause output of energy

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
into the body that
affects all your organs.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It seems that some people
have the propensity

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
to discharge brain stress into
various parts of their body,

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and certain people
channel their distress

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:90%
into usually one place.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It's really ironic.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people get back
pain from stress.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Some people get chest
pains from stress.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people get
ulcers from stress.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people get upper neck
and headaches from stress.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:10%
This is all channeled
energy and distress

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:10%
from the brain going to
various parts of the body,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:10%
and manifesting as
physical findings

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:10%
and signs from, essentially,
brain stress being channeled

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:10%
elsewhere.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain, I think,
has only a certain capacity

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:90%
to hold onto nervous energy.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Then it has to discharge
it into the body.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's definite
mind-body connection.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people channel their
stress into their, heart

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and we know that stress,
and adrenaline that's

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
produced by stress,
goes into the heart

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and can affect the
heart in an adverse way,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that it can create
abnormal heart rhythms,

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
spasm of the arteries
of the heart,

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and clogging up the arteries
of the heart due to adrenaline

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
causing platelets, which
are the blood clotting

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
material in the
body to coagulate.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline does all
that in addition

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
a spasm of the arteries.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, the heart
is an electrical organ.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:10%
It produces, by far,
the strongest source

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:10%
of bioelectricity in our
body, up to 40 to 60 times

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:10%
stronger than the second
most powerful source, which

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:10%
is the brain.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:10%
This electrical
energy travels though

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:10%
every single cell in our
body, and, in a sense,

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:10%
kind of binds the
cells together.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It's strong enough
that it even can

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
be detected outside the
body, out into space,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:90%
beyond the skin.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not an aura that we're
measuring when we do this,

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:90%
or anything like subtle energy.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
What it is very measurable
electromagnetic energy,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.417 align:middle line:90%
much like radio waves.

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is
that the heart produces

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic
field that surrounds

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:90%
our entire body in 360 degrees.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And then it can be detected
about three to four feet

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:84%
with magnetometers
outside the body.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Researchers at the
Menninger Clinic in Kansas

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.006 align:middle line:84%
say they've detected
it 10 to 12 feet.

00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of
how far it goes,

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.921 align:middle line:84%
what's interesting
is that we produce

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic field
that can be detected,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that can be measured
with sensitive mainstream

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:90%
medical equipment.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The human nervous system
is an electrical energy system

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
where positive and
negative ions flow.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We can even measure the surface
electrical activity of the body

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
at the fingertips using
a simple voltage meter

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:90%
in the millivolts setting.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Most human beings
have far less than 1

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
volt total, regardless of where
we measure along the body.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:84%
The numbers oscillate due to
the numerous electrical pulses

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:90%
in our nervous system.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Testing hundreds of
individuals, our study

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
has shown that everyone
has different voltages

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
at different moments
in their lives.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Children tend to test
around a quarter of a volt,

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
while adults can range anywhere
between 0.5 and 3,100ths

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
of a volt. If we are less
than a 1 and 1/2 volt battery,

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
how can we broadcast a
powerful energy signature?

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And how can we hear a
message that is meant for us?

>> The greatest mind control
experiment the government ever

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
did on us is tell us that
our minds are not powerful.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:84%
In the year 2009, I conducted
hundreds of volt meter tests

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
on the human nervous
system from age groups

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:84%
from, literally, children
to teenagers to middle years

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:90%
into elderly years.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I found that all human beings
have different millivolt

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:90%
ranges in their nervous system.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous system runs
positive and negative ions

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
through our body,
through our hands

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and our feet and our chest.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Our entire body
is being energized

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
by the central
nervous system and

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.378 align:middle line:90%
the autonomic nervous system.

00:14:57.378 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
People who have
medical conditions,

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
such as severe depression
or nervous system disorders,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
such as MS, have
millivolt ranges

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that go between somewhere around
five and maybe nine millivolts.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, to give you a
comparison, the average person

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:10%
ranges between 50, or maybe
even 30 and 100 millivolts.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:10%
That's the average person in
the average state of conscious.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
A millivolt is
1/1,000 of a volt.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So our body is running between,
maybe, 30 and 100 millivolts,

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:90%
optimally.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That's when we're really
in our optimal range.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.732 align:middle line:84%
If there was a way to raise
the human body voltage,

00:15:45.732 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:84%
which is the electricity
in our nervous system,

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to higher levels that

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:84%
2 full volts per cell,
which is 10,000 millivolts--

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
what will happen to
our consciousness?

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Would it would be
easier for us to project

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts to cooperatively
affect our reality.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Would it be easier for us
to apply a stronger signal

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
to the law of attraction?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Think of a radio.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.132 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to listen to your
favorite song on the radio,

00:16:17.132 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and you can barely hear it
because your radio doesn't

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:90%
have enough power.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.084 align:middle line:84%
Well, your body is like a
radio transmitter receiver.

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have enough
energy in your system

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.333 align:middle line:84%

thoughts out into the universe

to attract your soulmate,
to attract a business idea,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
to become more
creative, and you don't

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:84%
have enough power in
your nervous system,

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.385 align:middle line:84%
the chances of you manifesting
your reality the way

00:16:41.385 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
you want it to be are
going to be much lower.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So you need to increase
your energy levels first,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
which you can do by
meditation, and you can also

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.160 align:middle line:84%
do by using technologies,

You can hear voices.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can see photographs
in all of your data files

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.345 align:middle line:90%
in ordinary plastic.

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll give you an
example here of what we have.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
We have, this is
stone technology.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It's in the same shape as the
universe, which is a toroid.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the same shape
as the Earth's magnetic field

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and the same shape as the
human eye and the iris.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we send
these stone pendants--

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
which you can wear around your
neck and hold in your hands--

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
we send them into a series of
five quantum energy generators,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and we charge them with
tachyon energy, which

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:90%
is faster than light energy.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency vibrations
of the tree of life

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency
vibration of the NASA

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:90%
actual sound of the sun.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, like little
miniature hard drives,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%
we found a way to trap,
just like a DVD does, traps

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.510 align:middle line:84%
a movie or a song, we can
trap the healing vibrations

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:90%
of the universe in a stone.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Then what we did is
we tested people.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:10%
Hundreds and hundreds
of people were

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:10%
tested, wearing the
pendant, holding it

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:10%
with the left and
the right fingers,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:10%
and we could clearly
find, within seconds,

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:10%
the human body voltage would
come to much higher levels.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:10%
>> While these amazing
stone pendants can raise

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:10%
your vibration,
scientifically demonstrated,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:10%
could this increased energy
be applied to broadcasting

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:10%
our thoughts and
true intentions,

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:10%
giving us a stronger signal?

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Super athletes and psychics
and healers and telepaths have

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:84%
much higher body voltage
than the average person.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller conducted
human voltage studies on human

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
beings who are Qigong
masters, or healers,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating
extrasensory abilities.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.960 align:middle line:10%
>> 50 to 100
millivolts is natural.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:10%
If you put electrodes
on the ear, which

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:10%
is a norm for the body
in physiological tests,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:10%
then you're talking
about a few millivolts.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:10%
But if you're working
with a healer,

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:10%
as we did experiments,
copper wall experiments--

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:10%
Elmer Green and I did
this back in the '70s--

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:10%
then the healer-- you
can measure body voltages

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:10%
on the walls--

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and we found that a healer
could increase the body voltage

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:10%
on a wall, reflected, of
course, from the body,

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:10%
or received by
transmission from the body.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
25 volts, 50 volts,
100 volts, 250 volts.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We have been able to get
signatures of that size.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I was
very interested in that.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And I created a
theoretical model

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
that what happens when a
healer is projecting healing

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
to someone, that at
some place in the body,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
there is a site where
the action occurs

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring about this
transmission of energy.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:10%
And when I looked
at Elmer's data,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:10%
he had five pieces
of experimental data.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
He had the voltage
on the ear and he

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
had voltage on four walls,
one in front, one behind,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:90%
one above, one below.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So five equations and five
unknown, suit should solve.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I solve those
equations, and I

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
found that for this
particular healer,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the source, the primary
source, was the dantian point,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:90%
just below the belly button.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Is our bioconsciousness
likened to a living computer

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
system, having its own power
supply, memory, feelings,

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
transmit information?

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, imagine that you
yourself have been designed,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:10%
evolved, to be the most
positively brilliant quantum

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:10%
level computer processor
solution generator ever,

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:10%
ever evolved, designed,
devised on planet Earth.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:10%
The huge problem is that over
the course of us growing up,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:10%
most of us have taken on a whole
series of computer viruses.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
within yourself, you

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
might have as many as
100 major viruses, which

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
are clogging the ability of
that computer to function

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:90%
at its most brilliant levels.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, imagine if you

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:84%
can learn to clear that
processor to the point

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
where it would begin to totally
hum in tune with the quantum

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
field at such a level of
openness and vibratory

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
awareness that it would actually
begin to function at the level

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.805 align:middle line:84%
that it was truly
designed to function at.

00:23:44.805 --> 00:23:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found is that the
frequencies in that field,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic energy
and the frequencies that are

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
in the radiation from the heart,
actually change depending upon

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
what we are feeling.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:10%
Our emotional state
influences changes

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:10%
in that electromagnetic
signature.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:10%
For instance, if we're feeling
a strong negative emotion,

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:10%
like anger or
frustration, it creates

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:10%
what researchers call
an incoherent spectra

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:10%
in that electromagnetic field,
lots of different frequencies

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:10%
fighting for power.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The pattern looks very
jagged and irregular,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
kind of like you'd see
if you were looking

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:90%
at a pattern of an earthquake.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And we see that electromagnetic
signature, again,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.492 align:middle line:84%
when people are feeling
these negative emotions.

00:24:28.492 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
The good news is is that we
see a completely different kind

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of field when people are feeling
positive emotions, really

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
heart-based emotions,
emotions that

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
have long been metaphorically
associated with heart.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if we're feeling
a real genuine appreciation,

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or sincere care,
real compassion,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
what we see in that
field is what's

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:90%
called a harmonic spectrum.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies are
now working together.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.309 align:middle line:84%
They create what's called
a harmonic sequence.

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:90%
They're not fighting for power.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:90%
They're supporting one another.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And all these
changes occur because

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:90%
of what we do as human beings.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
The emotional qualities
that we are bringing to life

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:90%
effect that field.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you take that
a step further.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
The field surrounds
us in 360 degrees.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
We're broadcasting that
energy, first of all,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to our own bodies, but we're
also sending it out into space.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we are
communicating our emotions

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:84%
through an electromagnetic
field produced by the heart.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
more research to be

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.501 align:middle line:84%
done on this, because
now we've moved

00:25:25.501 --> 00:25:26.885 align:middle line:90%
beyond biology into physics.

00:25:26.885 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're into
electromagnetic fields.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
How do these fields
affect one another?

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.522 align:middle line:90%
How do they affect each other?

00:25:32.522 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
These are all
interesting questions

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that we have ongoing research to
come up with definitive answers

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
just the beginning.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.975 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
we're measuring

00:25:40.975 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
is some of the densest
energy produced by the heart,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and that there's another subtle
energy component of heart that

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
is far more powerful,
far more interesting,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.685 align:middle line:84%
and it radiates far
beyond just a few feet.

00:25:50.685 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And all that will be discovered
in the next few years.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the energy
centers of the body,

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
the heart center produces
the strongest signal.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:10%
With heart disease being
the world's number one

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:10%
cause of death and
the heart center

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:10%
being the main broadcast
power center of the body,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:10%
we have to nurture
and respect it

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:10%
as if our lives depend on it.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
If we intend to send out a
signal to attract a response

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and our central power
source is damaged,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we will be sending
out a weak signal.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, do the
magnetic laws of attraction

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
hear a weak signal?

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
While we are living at
one location on the earth

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and the people we want
to may be in another,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:84%
how can we communicate
with our future soul

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:90%
matches through the field?

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the most important
thing is doing soul work,

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:10%
meaning putting your soul
into the conscious field where

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:10%
your soulmate's
soul can find yours.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:10%
And that doesn't have to
do with outward things

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:10%
so much as it has to do
with accessing your soul.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of us, that can be
confusing because we may think

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:10%
our emotions are our soul.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:10%
But usually, our
emotions are tied

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:12.979 align:middle line:10%
into past issues and
psychological triggers,

00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:10%
so that's not what
I'm talking about.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about
nurturing your soul

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:10%
in some way on a daily basis,
or bringing it out, finding

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:10%
ways that will trigger it
so that it expands outside

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:10%
of your aura and into
the conscious field where

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:10%
you would have other souls.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a line of
communication, or a signal,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
so that the other soul, when
they're in that field as well,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:90%
will recognize you.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, ultimately,
you'll meet physically.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
meet your soulmate,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
a spiritual soul bond.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
bonding on a personality

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:84%
level or a cultural,
social, or religious level.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the soul bond.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be doing
soul work on a regular basis

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
to bring that
intention out there.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:10%
>> "The field is a
soul governing agency

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:10%
of the particle."

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.530 align:middle line:10%
What he meant by that is to
field, the invisible forces,

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:10%
are the soul governing agency
of the particle matter.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So it says, human beings
as physical matter

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.681 align:middle line:84%
are actually governed
and shaped by the field.

00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're
beginning to learn,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:84%
reading the field is very
important for our survival.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The human body has an aura
of electromagnetic light energy

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that radiates far beyond the
boundaries of our physical

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Doing another simple experiment
with our radio antenna,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:84%
we can see that a weak or
static radio station comes in

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:84%
more clearly just as our
hand comes near the antenna,

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.090 align:middle line:90%
without even touching it.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Arizona Senate Democrats are
pleased that President Barack

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Obama will be in Phoenix
next week to speak about

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:90%
the economic stimulus plan.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Minority leader Jorge
Garcia of Tucson

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
says the emergency fund will
hopefully offset spending cuts

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Republican controlled
legislature are imposing

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:90%
to balance the state budget.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This is simple scientific
proof that our field is

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the field of
the radio waves at a distance.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness transmits
information into the field,

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but how powerful are our
thoughts and feelings?

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to clear your
field so that you are creating

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:90%
a very intentional signal.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:84%
By that, one of
the things is not

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
dating or having
flings, not holding

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
on to semi relationships
that have your foot in--

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:90%
one foot in and one foot out.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You want to clear all of that
because that will actually

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
create confusion in the
line of communication.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It'll make it static.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And it will also bring
people around you

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that can misguide
you, or you may

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:90%
think that they're the ones.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But it'll be confusing
you because you're

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:90%
sending mixed messages.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So they may be partially what
you want, but they're not,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
in fact, your true
soulmate because you're

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:84%
sending out mixed messages
about what you want.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's vital to clear
your space on that level,

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.080 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking for an
intimate soulmate relationship.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Totally clear that space and
make it open and available

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to actually find
the true soulmate

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.735 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking for.

00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> As all seven of our body's
energy centers send out living

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:84%
light waves of different
frequencies and amplitudes,

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.340 align:middle line:84%
they're also sending out
our personal information.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.990 align:middle line:84%
This means our inner spiritual
architecture represents

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:84%
a personal signature of
our knowledge, experiences,

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.260 align:middle line:84%
desires, feelings, true
intentions, and deepest

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.900 align:middle line:90%
thoughts.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.990 align:middle line:84%
This signature will be
met with a response,

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:45.480 align:middle line:84%
whether we are
conscious of it or not.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.048 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.048 --> 00:31:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ways to understand
the mystery of attraction,

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of what pulls
some people together,

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.530 align:middle line:84%
why one woman will turn a man
on and that same woman will not

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.880 align:middle line:90%
turn another man on.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Why one man will just
make a woman open up

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.217 align:middle line:10%
in feelings of love,
and that same man

00:32:03.217 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:10%
will be nice to another
woman but she doesn't have

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:10%
those same feelings to her.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.220 align:middle line:84%
There is an actual dynamic
between the different energy

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:90%
centers in the body.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the seven
basic energy centers,

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:84%
they're like
circuits in the body.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And as individuals,
we're not completely

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:84%
whole in that all those circuits
are connecting all the time.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, I just spend
time with some people

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, I
naturally feel smarter.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I feel brighter.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
That's because their
circuits are activating

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:84%
a part of my circuitry that
makes the energy flow more

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.530 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.382 align:middle line:84%
Often people go to
a spiritual teacher,

00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and they'll put them on
a pedestal because just

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
that person, they

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:84%
feel so spiritually
more awakened.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the higher
centers starts to open.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not that that
person sitting there

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
would have that
effect on everyone,

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.400 align:middle line:84%
nor does that person necessarily
have all their circuits

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.367 align:middle line:90%
together at all.

00:32:50.367 --> 00:32:52.325 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
happened to have one or two

00:32:52.325 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
circuits that are open that
complete another person.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way,
it's like a man

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:84%
being turned on to
a woman over here

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and another man not
being turned on.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
This woman literally activates
some circuitry inside

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of this man that completes
his energy center,

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:84%
so now energy is flowing
to the sexual center.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.280 align:middle line:84%
There's always been known
in the past the muse.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
The muse would
inspire the writer.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have the muse,
that little circuitry allows

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:84%
him to express
what's inside of him,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.330 align:middle line:90%
simply couldn't be connected.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's what the muse does.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So in a variety of
situations, our relationships

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
activate certain circuits
inside of ourselves

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that connect up the
different energy centers.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.507 align:middle line:84%
Generally, we find someone
that we're in love with,

00:33:33.507 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
someone that we want
to share our life with.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what we often
call a soulmate,

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's someone who activates
the circuits in our heart.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.160 align:middle line:84%
They activate us to the
eternalness of love.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when we interact with
this person and we're open,

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:84%
not when we're shut down,
but when we're open,

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.210 align:middle line:84%
we feel this part of us
that can love them forever

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and wants to love them forever,
and that's what we often

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:90%
define as a soulmate.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They may not be the one
that opens our mind,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:84%
or opens our sense
of creativity,

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.269 align:middle line:90%
or gives us confidence.

00:33:59.269 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be the
one that opens our heart.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It could be they can open
three levels, or two levels,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:90%
or all seven levels.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:84%
And that's the uniqueness
of every relationship.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.620 align:middle line:10%
Never look for
perfection in a person,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:10%
but to know that the
perfect relationship for us

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.845 align:middle line:10%
is someone who stimulates in us.

00:34:14.845 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:10%
When we're feeling
centered, they

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:10%
stimulate it within us
a feeling, a knowing,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:10%
that this is a person I'd
like to share my life with.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:84%
In their presence, I
become a better person.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The people we meet and
the spiritual experiences we

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
attract by coincidences may
not actually be coincidences.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:84%
They may be the results of
our personal broadcasting.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:10%
>> So when you want to make
contact with your soulmate

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:10%
in the conscious field
before actually meeting them

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:10%
in person, it's when you're
actually doing your soul work

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:10%
on a daily basis that you
want to put those intentions

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:10%
and feelings into the field.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is, like during
meditation or prayer,

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you want it with
the feeling tone

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.910 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to meet your
soulmate into that space.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're writing about your
inner emotions and desires,

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.985 align:middle line:84%
you want to put that
feeling tone there.

00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're just
nurturing yourself,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:26.000 align:middle line:84%
put the feeling tone of
having a soulmate relationship

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in that space, in
that soul work space,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:84%
which will go into
the conscious field.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:84%
What you don't want to do
is put preconceived ideas

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
into that space about what
your soulmate looks like,

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:84%
All those things, it
has to do with control.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you're really
ready for your soulmate,

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.440 align:middle line:84%
you're ready to let
go of your control

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:84%
because a soulmate is,
in fact, a soul bond.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to do with
all those outward conditions

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:90%
or ideas.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It has mostly to do with
that soul connection.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say
you put the feeling

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.620 align:middle line:84%
tone in that special
space more than anything.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> As human beings, each one of
us is characterized by our own

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
vibrational frequency, which
is a reflection of the proteins

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:90%
in creating our biology.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.834 align:middle line:10%
The significance is
that, as individuals

00:36:17.834 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:10%
with individual
frequencies, there

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:10%
are some people
whose frequencies

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:10%
are more complementary,
or more matching,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:10%
than other individuals
whose frequencies

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:10%
are quite different.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The relevance to this is
that matching frequencies,

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or complementary frequencies,
interact with each other

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and actually, in the
terms of physics,

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:90%
interfere with each other.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And as two very closely related
frequencies come together,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.540 align:middle line:84%
their interference
patterns result

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:84%
in enhancement of
the field itself,

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.620 align:middle line:90%
a powering of that field.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
constructive interference.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It allows two individuals
that are closely related

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to communicate
across this field.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
The most characteristic
and easily understood

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
communication is
that that usually

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.205 align:middle line:84%
occurs between a
mother and her child,

00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:84%
which they're, of course, very
much connected to each other.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the child has cells
from the mother in it because

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of the developmental
processes that

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:90%
occur during fetal development.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
the mother has stem cells

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
from her child in her body as
a result of fetal development

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.350 align:middle line:84%
as well, so that both
the mother and the child

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
are actually sharing cells
with the same receptor

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.650 align:middle line:90%
frequencies on them.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, and
this is very interesting

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
because mothers
will report this,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that they will know if something
is wrong with their child,

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.250 align:middle line:84%
no matter where their
child is on the planet.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
common experience,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that if a child is hurt,
a mother will know this,

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
even if she is on the
other side of the planet.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.030 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
demonstration of the fact

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that the communication
between individuals

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
can be picked up through
this vibrational field

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and, specifically, through
the receptors of identity

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:90%
on the surfaces of our cells.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the significance
of that is it

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to
be your own child.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.735 align:middle line:10%
It's people that you
actually complement

00:38:02.735 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:10%
with out in the
field can communicate

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.980 align:middle line:10%
across these distances.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And very interestingly enough,
when people come together

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
as couples and are
together long enough,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:84%
they can actually begin to use
this field as communication

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:84%
mechanism without
even using words.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's very funny
sometimes to hear

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.300 align:middle line:84%
a couple that has been
together for a very long time

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
communicate with each other with
totally incomplete sentences,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:84%
with no subjects or verbs, and
yet both of them understanding

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.900 align:middle line:84%
the communication, while an
outside party has no idea what

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:90%
they're talking about.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is because we have
two levels of communication,

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
the field and via the
particle, via the body.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
that we're now

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.460 align:middle line:84%
beginning to recognize
the fields in effect.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is very,
very critical for both

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:84%
our communal
organization, as well

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:84%
as our own physiological
expression,

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the power
of the vibrations

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and how they can
influence our own biology.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Brainwaves are
indicative of consciousness,

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
can travel as a wave.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.020 align:middle line:84%
These waves can be reduced
to numerical values

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of wave particles, amplitudes,
frequencies, spin, codes,

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and information.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Professional numerologists
study these numbers and codes.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
They study the numerical
values of the position

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of the stars and the
planets at the time and date

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:84%
of our birth, our birth
location, and our name.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for
advanced numerology

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.085 align:middle line:84%
to determine our relationships
and possible future outcomes?

00:39:42.085 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Numbers have harmonic and
disharmonic relationships,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:10%
just like music does.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.830 align:middle line:10%
So you can listen
to certain music

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:10%
and you know, my
gosh, I don't like it.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:10%
It jars me.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.990 align:middle line:90%
There's too much disharmony.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:90%
The same goes for numbers.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody has a
prevalent amount of 3's, 6's,

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and 9's in his or her blueprint
and they meet somebody

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.020 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of 4's
and 8's, they're not

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.140 align:middle line:84%
going to get along as
readily as with somebody

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.336 align:middle line:84%
who also has the creative
3's, 6's, and 9's

00:40:14.336 --> 00:40:16.344 align:middle line:90%
in their blueprint.

00:40:16.344 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
there are certain numbers

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that are magnetically
attracted to each other.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Those are the numbers 4 and 8.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So they have almost a faithful
relationship to each other.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So it gets quite
complex, as we look

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
at the song and the numbers
song, of each person,

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
create two blueprints,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
put them together,
just like a musical.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.405 align:middle line:84%
You take two melodies
or harmonies,

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and you put them together,
and what does it create?

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Does it creates
something jarring or not?

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And certainly with
people, we can

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
see how their numbers
either work well together,

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
be compatible, or be
completely harmonious,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.360 align:middle line:84%
just because numbers
are a resonance.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:84%
They describe something
that is key to who you are.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Your soul energy
is a unique signal

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that is broadcast into a field
where your soulmate's soul

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:84%
energy is being
broadcast as well.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So that is where
your souls are bonded

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:84%
when you have a soulmate, and
that's where you're already

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
having a relationship
with your soulmate,

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
whether you're
aware of it or not.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And whether you're aware of
your soul desires and feelings

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:84%
or if you're not is irrelevant,
because you're already

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.710 align:middle line:84%
bonded with your
soulmate on that level.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And the goal is to become
aware of yourself on that level

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
broadcast your soul

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.770 align:middle line:84%
into the conscious field, where
your soul mate can do the same.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.890 align:middle line:10%
And that will
trigger and speed up

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:56.710 align:middle line:10%
the process of finding your
soulmate in a physical plane

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:59.200 align:middle line:10%
so that you actually
are meeting them

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.780 align:middle line:10%
and are able to
have a relationship

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:10%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Our DNA represents our
entire genetic blueprint.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It is here that
everything about us

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.670 align:middle line:84%
is represented by letters in
the DNA matrix code language.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Our destiny appears
fixed because

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.680 align:middle line:90%
of this unshakable blueprint.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fritz-Albert
Popp, the discoverer

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of biophotons in 1976,
proved the origin

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
of these human light
emissions are emanating

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:84%
from our DNA, the core reactor
from where we are broadcasting

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:39.100 align:middle line:90%
our personal energy signature.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Lipton has made
a revolutionary discovery

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:84%
that first proved that
the DNA nucleus is not

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:90%
the brain of the cell.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the intelligence center
of the cell is the membrane.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:84%
The membrane receives signals
from our consciousness

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and writes the DNA code.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.720 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
history, Dr. Bruce Lipton

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:84%
is proving that we can actually
reprogram our DNA, if we

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:14.510 align:middle line:84%
are dissatisfied
with our blueprint,

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and broadcast a new
message about ourselves

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact is that the cell
membrane of the human cell

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.800 align:middle line:84%
actually is an
information processor.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I ultimately
realized in 1985

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:36.020 align:middle line:84%
was that that processor had a
very interesting and important

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:90%
definition.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
the membrane is--

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a liquid
crystal semiconductor

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.810 align:middle line:90%
with gates and channels.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:84%
When I recognized this
biochemical description

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.810 align:middle line:84%
in 1985, I was very much
amused by it because I said,

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that
exact same definition

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else, and actually
had to go search for where

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I heard it, or found it.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was I read it
in a book called "Understanding

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Your Microprocessor," a
simpleton book about how

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:90%
to use a computer.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the definition
liquid crystal semiconductor

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.860 align:middle line:84%
with gates and channels is
the exact same definition

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:90%
of a computer chip.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
What this all led to was a very
simple, and yet very profound,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.450 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%
The cell is an
information processor

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.890 align:middle line:84%
because the membrane
reads the environment

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:90%
and adjusts the biology.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The nucleus of the
cell, with its genes,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.200 align:middle line:84%
represents a hard disk,
and the genes are programs.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Our old belief system is that
the nucleus and its programs

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:40.490 align:middle line:84%
were read-only memories, so
that whatever the genes are,

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.170 align:middle line:90%
that would be our fate.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.380 align:middle line:84%
However, the new insights
offered, revealed,

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that the nucleus of the
cell was not read-only.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It was actually read right.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the cell
was a programmable device.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You could put it
into an environment,

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:84%
it would read the
environment, and then

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.840 align:middle line:84%
adjust the expression
of the genes

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.210 align:middle line:84%
to match the needs
of that environment.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So taking genetically
identical cells

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and putting one
set into a culture

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:84%
with certain
environmental conditions

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.930 align:middle line:84%
cause the cell to program
itself as a muscle cell.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And a genetically
identical cell,

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.870 align:middle line:84%
put in yet another environment,
reading the constituents

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
in that environment, would lead
to the expression of a bone

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:90%
cell.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the cells are
programmable in response

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.840 align:middle line:90%
to environmental information.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And one last piece, just to
tie it together for all of us

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to understand, is that if you
put a culture dish of cells

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.110 align:middle line:84%
into an adverse environment,
then what would happen

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.610 align:middle line:84%
is that those cells
would actually

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:90%
get sick and start to die.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you take that
very same culture dish

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and move it into a
healthy environment,

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:84%
the same cells would immediately
recover and start to perforate

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:90%
and the cultures will flourish.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The relevance about
all this is that we

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:84%
go back to the nature
of a human being

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
containing 50 trillion cells,

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:04.130 align:middle line:84%
the human body is essentially
a skin-covered Petri dish.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:84%
If you take your
human Petri dish body

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and put it into an
adverse environment,

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.400 align:middle line:84%
it will cause the
cells to get sick

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and to actually begin to die.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you take that
same skin-covered body

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a
healthy environment,

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.370 align:middle line:84%
the cells will rapidly recover
and begin to flourish again.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So the important reality is that
our state of health or disease

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.154 align:middle line:84%
is really a reflection of the
environment that we live in

00:46:28.154 --> 00:46:29.695 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
that we perceive.

00:46:29.695 --> 00:46:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't trust me.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.122 align:middle line:10%
He goes, I will torment you.

00:46:44.122 --> 00:46:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And I swear to God, that's
what ended up happening.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been tormented
by this relationship.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In each one of us, there
are 46 human chromosomes,

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.390 align:middle line:84%
among which there are nearly
three billion base pairs

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.350 align:middle line:90%
of DNA.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:07.000 align:middle line:84%
That means there are three
billion strands inside of us

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.600 align:middle line:84%
to store our
personal information.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.270 align:middle line:84%
If we can rewrite
our own hard drive

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:17.170 align:middle line:84%
by reorganizing our thoughts,
feelings, and higher

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:22.090 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, we can reprogram
our own personal blueprint

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:25.990 align:middle line:90%
to attain any goal we desire.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:30.250 align:middle line:84%
As our personal energy signature
broadcasts this new message,

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:34.450 align:middle line:84%
we will discover new people
in our coincidence meetings.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.080 align:middle line:84%
We will also gain new
knowledge to apply

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
towards our own enlightenment,
relationships, careers,

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.430 align:middle line:90%
and life purpose.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Scientific studies have
shown, the heart is not only

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
center in the body,

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:55.550 align:middle line:84%
it is the most intelligent for
having the ability to receive

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:90%
precognition.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.520 align:middle line:84%
If we can create a coherence
with our minds and hearts

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.860 align:middle line:84%
center, we can access our
intuition more frequently.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:10%
>> One interesting study that
was done here at the Institute

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:10%
of HeartMath, with our chief
researcher, Dr. Rollin McCraty,

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.230 align:middle line:10%
was a study on intuition,
the intuitive response.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And in that study,
they had test subjects

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:10%
that were placed in
front of a computer,

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.496 align:middle line:10%
and they were wired up.

00:48:23.496 --> 00:48:24.870 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
at brain waves.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.703 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at
galvanic skin response.

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at readings
from the heart rate variability

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.570 align:middle line:90%
analysis, and things like that.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Test subject would push a button
and there would be a delay

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.643 align:middle line:84%
before the picture would appear
on the screen of the computer.

00:48:36.643 --> 00:48:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And the computer was
randomly selecting pictures.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:84%
No one knew, no one could
know, what the computer

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:42.994 align:middle line:90%
was going to select.

00:48:42.994 --> 00:48:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of the pictures
were pleasant

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.170 align:middle line:90%
and some were horrific.

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.180 align:middle line:84%
What we found was,
and in many cases,

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.320 align:middle line:84%
the bodies started responding
to the upcoming picture,

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.840 align:middle line:84%
responding in the way it
would normally to the upcoming

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.900 align:middle line:84%
picture, about six seconds
prior to the picture

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.450 align:middle line:84%
actually showing
up on the screen.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Six seconds prior,
the body began

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to do what it would do
if the picture was there.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very complicated
study, a very detailed study.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.310 align:middle line:84%
It was published in two parts
in the "Journal of Complimentary

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.560 align:middle line:90%
and Alternative Medicine."

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:84%
The data analysis showed
something very, very

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.530 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It showed that
whenever spots began,

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that the first part
of our physiology that

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.990 align:middle line:84%
was doing sort of the intuitive
or precognitive response,

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:28.350 align:middle line:90%
was actually the heart.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The heart was responding
before the brain.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:33.022 align:middle line:84%
It began to go through a
deceleration process that

00:49:33.022 --> 00:49:34.730 align:middle line:84%
would be compatible
with the picture that

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:36.011 align:middle line:90%
was going to come up.

00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:84%
About a second and a
half later, the brain

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.910 align:middle line:84%
began to do what it does
in regards to that picture.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But within the human system
at the physiological level,

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:84%
measuring that intuitive
response to an upcoming event,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.640 align:middle line:84%
it was the heart
that responded first.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.044 align:middle line:10%
And as I read the
summary of that study,

00:49:53.044 --> 00:49:55.460 align:middle line:10%
I found it fascinating, because
what the summary basically

00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:00.030 align:middle line:10%
said is that it appears as if an
upcoming event is significant,

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:10%
or emotional, that
we have a tendency

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.400 align:middle line:10%
to be able to sense that,
or to respond to it,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.290 align:middle line:10%
before it actually occurs.

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:08.990 align:middle line:10%
And that our biology
has the capacity,

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:10%
and it does, in many ways,
scan for the future events.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly scanning
for future events.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But that is something
we're not aware of.

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.545 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that it's there
we don't know that we do it.

00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But the punch line is that it
would be very useful for us

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to develop that, and it
has a lot of utility,

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of practicality in
how we navigate our lives.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just
one study beginning

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to decode something
that's remained mystical,

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.180 align:middle line:90%
or vague, which is intuition.

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.767 align:middle line:90%
What is intuition?

00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think, certainly, there's
a lot more to go in that area.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But this is one
study that indicates

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is a response, that
the body itself is actually

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.760 align:middle line:84%
scanning for future events,
and that the first responder

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.370 align:middle line:84%
in that entire process
is not the brain,

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.770 align:middle line:90%
but in fact, it is the heart.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that our whole
biosystem begins to shift,

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.120 align:middle line:10%
in terms of what we,
in sports psychology,

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:06.390 align:middle line:10%
have been referring to
as being in our zone.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So when a person learns to open
into that more quantum attuned

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.780 align:middle line:84%
way of being aware
and being present,

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:20.030 align:middle line:84%
it's like, instead of
focusing in narrow band,

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.660 align:middle line:84%
problem-focused,
fear-based ways,

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.320 align:middle line:84%
where we're looking
at some kind of threat

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and focused entirely
on a problem,

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and all our internal
organs begin to contract,

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and thus, our emotional system
begins to go into overreaction.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:84%
When we're feeling
emotive, when we're

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.730 align:middle line:84%
being within that zone
space, our internal organs

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.200 align:middle line:90%
begin to open up.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.880 align:middle line:90%
They begin to relax.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Our awareness field, instead
of being narrow bound focused,

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.820 align:middle line:90%
starts to broadband focus.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And what studies have shown
is that in that state,

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.630 align:middle line:84%
we actually begin to
process way more bits

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of information per moment.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in that
state, we have the experience

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.210 align:middle line:90%
as though time is slowing down.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
from time and motion

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.810 align:middle line:84%
studies in movie
projection, that when

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:17.720 align:middle line:84%
we feed more frames of
information per moment

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:84%
through a projector,
it creates the illusion

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:90%
of time slowing down.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is often what
people experience

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.310 align:middle line:84%
when they're in that zone
state of more quantum field

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.350 align:middle line:90%
present attuned awareness.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.290 align:middle line:84%
They start to feel
like they can make

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:36.530 align:middle line:84%
much more effective
decisions in a kind

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.650 align:middle line:90%
of ongoing, flow-like way.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We've all had a taste of what
it's like to be in this zone.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It's those magical
times when you

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.340 align:middle line:84%
have a few hours, a
few days sometimes,

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.760 align:middle line:84%
even sometimes a few weeks,
where it seems like you just

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.860 align:middle line:90%
can't do anything wrong.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes up roses.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.880 align:middle line:84%
You're in the right
place at the right time.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The right information
comes to you.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel like
you're being guided

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.550 align:middle line:90%
to make the right decisions.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of what
we're talking about,

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of becoming more
quantum level attuned.

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1992, Professor Walter
Schempp discovered how atoms

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:21.230 align:middle line:84%
communicate with each other over
any distance through the field.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:23.960 align:middle line:84%
He discovered in the
atom, when electrons

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.730 align:middle line:84%
are in a higher frequency shell,
or orbit around the proton,

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:31.760 align:middle line:84%
the atom emits light
waves, carrying

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:84%
intelligent information, similar
to the way when we are talking

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and communicating,
our brainwaves

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.820 align:middle line:84%
go into a higher
frequency wave state.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.930 align:middle line:84%
He found when the electron
jumps to a lower frequency

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:48.110 align:middle line:84%
wavelength, the atom
receives photons

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:50.450 align:middle line:84%
carrying intelligent
information,

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:54.290 align:middle line:84%
as if they are listening,
just as when we are listening,

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:57.500 align:middle line:84%
we go into a lower
frequency brain wave state.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The timing of when electrons
jump shells to higher or lower

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:06.710 align:middle line:84%
frequency orbits is completely
random and cannot be quantified

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.940 align:middle line:84%
by any mathematical
predictable formula,

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:13.650 align:middle line:84%
likened to random
human behavior.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.850 align:middle line:84%
There are several other
behaviors in quantum mechanics

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that remind physicists of
human random consciousness,

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.450 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
models demonstrating

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:26.780 align:middle line:84%
repeatable and reliable
mathematical timing,

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:31.790 align:middle line:84%
such as the sun rising every
day at the precise expected time

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and the nine planets
orbits around it.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:39.470 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum universe, finding
precise timing and repetition

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of events is very difficult
in certain functions

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.310 align:middle line:90%
of the atom and its components.

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Niels Bohr and
Heisenberg presented

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to Einstein at the 1927
5th Solvay Conference

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.110 align:middle line:84%
on quantum mechanics, that
the minds of the researchers

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:01.700 align:middle line:84%
were affecting the angular
momentum of the electron's spin

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.740 align:middle line:90%
around the proton.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:84%
This was because
different data came

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.340 align:middle line:84%
in when different
researchers were

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.320 align:middle line:90%
conducting the experiments.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The data was always
random and could not

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.320 align:middle line:84%
be quantified in a
repeatable and reliable

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.990 align:middle line:90%
mathematical formula.

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:22.100 align:middle line:84%
"As far as the laws of
mathematics refer to reality,

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.980 align:middle line:90%
they are not certain.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And as far as they are certain,
they do not refer to reality."

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Albert Einstein.

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.090 align:middle line:10%
In Richard Feynman's
book, "The Strange Theory

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.180 align:middle line:10%
of Light and Matter,"
he tried to quantify

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.650 align:middle line:10%
the behavior of the timing
of which light particles,

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.960 align:middle line:10%
photons, emanating
from a light source,

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.400 align:middle line:10%
would reflect through
several layers of glass

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.860 align:middle line:10%
and bounce back to detectors.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Light particles do
three things when

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.490 align:middle line:90%
they strike a glass target.

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:58.670 align:middle line:84%
One, they either travel
through the glass sheet.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Or two, they react and scatter
inside the glass sheet.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Or three, they bounce
back to give us

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.810 align:middle line:90%
a picture of the sheet of glass.

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Feynman shined his light
source through several sheets

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of glass, allowing
light particles

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to choose to bounce
off of or react

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:19.880 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of
various layers of glass.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:25.130 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to see if there was a
quantifiable formula for which

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.650 align:middle line:84%
photons would bounce
back and which

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.930 align:middle line:84%
ones would travel
through the glass,

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:33.560 align:middle line:84%
or penetrate deeper and bounce
off another sheet of glass,

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.370 align:middle line:84%
or scatter and
react inside of it.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Or deeper yet, travel through
all the sheets of glass.

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the
color of white,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and various other
parameters, there

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.160 align:middle line:84%
was no way to quantify the
strange behavior of light

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The white particles, photons,
always behave randomly as

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.690 align:middle line:84%
to what they would choose to do,
just as in human consciousness.

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Could human intention
be so powerful

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that it could tell
particles of light, photons,

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to penetrate through
several layers of glass,

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.540 align:middle line:90%
and even solid barriers?

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:22.350 align:middle line:84%
PhD psychologist
Stanislav O'Jack

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:84%
has demonstrated his
power of intention

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.920 align:middle line:90%
over the film plane of a camera.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.830 align:middle line:10%
His intention is so
powerful, he found

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:35.790 align:middle line:10%
he can cause a photograph
to appear while the lens

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:40.410 align:middle line:10%
cap on the camera is blocking
the lens and the film plane

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:43.450 align:middle line:10%
from receiving light.

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:46.350 align:middle line:10%
He has done this
hundreds of times.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:49.290 align:middle line:10%
He has also been able to
take pictures with film

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:54.680 align:middle line:10%
and cause invisible spiritual
phenomena to appear.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.610 align:middle line:10%
His film and photographs
were analyzed by Kodak film

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:04.520 align:middle line:10%
laboratories to be authentic and
not caused by double exposures

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.730 align:middle line:10%
or trick photography.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Several abnormalities
that began to occur

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.140 align:middle line:10%
in the photographs,
people became transparent,

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:18.200 align:middle line:10%
or they disappeared,
light aberrations.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then entities, which appear
to be humanlike in some form,

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:29.900 align:middle line:84%
but not as we would say it
was definitely humanoid.

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.500 align:middle line:10%
And these apparitions
went on over a period

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.980 align:middle line:10%
of about four years.

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:10%
It's '74 to, oh, it's
longer than that.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:49.260 align:middle line:10%
'74 to 1981-- over
5,000 photographs

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.410 align:middle line:10%
with a 22% anomalous
factor, in regards to that.

00:58:53.410 --> 00:59:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> As Stanislav O'Jack took a
mystical photograph of the 1972

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Seals and Crofts concert, a
large luminous face appears,

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:12.650 align:middle line:84%
overlooking the band
onstage with Cher.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Then what appeared to be a
band of divine beings of light,

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:22.280 align:middle line:84%
pointing, and perhaps even
dancing, to their music,

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.930 align:middle line:84%
gazed into our world without
us ever even knowing it.

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Could beings of light,
and even angels,

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.010 align:middle line:84%
have listened to
this spiritual music

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.880 align:middle line:90%
of Seals and Croft and Cher?

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Could such beings have
even inspired their music

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.110 align:middle line:90%
to be born?

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:51.290 align:middle line:10%
>> He took pictures with the
lens cap on the camera so that

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:55.890 align:middle line:10%
the radiations that eventually
were registered on the film

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:59.390 align:middle line:10%
went right through the lens
cap, and the lens cap will block

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.482 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic radiation.

01:00:01.482 --> 01:00:05.240 align:middle line:10%
So it definitely was
different radiations

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.790 align:middle line:10%
than electromagnetism,
and that's

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.150 align:middle line:10%
why I've called these
things subtle energies.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:12.020 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean they're weak.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.470 align:middle line:10%
It means they're subtle,
in the sense that they

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:17.420 align:middle line:10%
are very different from
the energies associated

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.940 align:middle line:10%
with the four fundamental
forces that we

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.890 align:middle line:10%
know from orthodox science.

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Claude Swanson's
Synchronized Universe model may

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:29.330 align:middle line:84%
help explain how we can see
into the invisible dimensions

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and explain
visions and apparitions,

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and how we can interact
with those dimensions,

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly, to
prove that they are part

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.900 align:middle line:90%
of our reality.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I developed what I call the
Synchronized Universe model

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:52.120 align:middle line:10%
as a way of trying to expand
current physics to account

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.380 align:middle line:10%
for a lot of these
psychic phenomena,

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.980 align:middle line:10%
paranormal phenomena, besides
the types of things we've been

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.290 align:middle line:10%
talking about, which involve
communication, psychically,

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:04.340 align:middle line:10%
and affecting things
at a distance.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
You also have other
abilities that the yogis have

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated, certain
adepts in China,

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the Qigong masters
have demonstrated,

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
things like walking
through walls, levitation,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
teleportation, things that,
in the West, we laugh at

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and we call them
science fiction.

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there are
people who have

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated reliable abilities
to produce these effects.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So our science needs
to be able to account

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.030 align:middle line:90%
for how this is possible.

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Synchronized
Universe model

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
says, basically,
that matter is not

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
what we thought it was, and
not like little billiard balls,

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
or even little quantum
points moving around,

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that when we say there's
a particle at some places,

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
a solid matter, what
that really involves

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
is an energy exchange between
that charge, or that particle,

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
particles of the universe,

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that things are moving very
rapidly on a very small scale.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a scale smaller than
the size of the electron,

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
down to more than the
plank scale, which

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is the basic smallest scale
that physics tries to describe.

01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
At that scale, there's
a synchronization

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that has to happen,
that particles only

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
see each other when their
velocities are lined up

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.550 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
In other words, at
a very small scale,

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
all the particles are
moving very rapidly

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the system, at
a very small scale,

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
this is part of why we have
special relativity, part

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
of our current physics.

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:39.380 align:middle line:10%
At very high
speeds, the particle

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.620 align:middle line:10%
only can kind of look at the
direction that it's traveling.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.530 align:middle line:10%
So if it emits a photon, it
has to be in the direction

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.710 align:middle line:10%
that it's traveling
at that instant.

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.775 align:middle line:10%
Off in the distance would
be some other particle.

01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to interact
mutually, back and forth,

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that particle also has to
have a velocity lined up

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:57.600 align:middle line:90%
with the first one.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So the primary interactions
of this very small scale

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
would involve particles
with velocities

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
that are aligned at that
moment of interaction.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
A moment later,
their velocities have

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
changed because they received
an impulse from one to another.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And what this leads to is
the only stable solution

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
of this system is when
the particles end up

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
being synchronized
with each other.

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The ones that
interact consistently,

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
on the average over
time, are the ones

01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that take on little orbits
at very small scale,

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
down to the plank level,
which are synchronized.

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
You can have many,
many other systems

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:39.185 align:middle line:84%
of particles that have
some other synchronization.

01:03:39.185 --> 01:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
frequency of oscillation,

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.965 align:middle line:84%
or a different phase during
some other part of their orbit

01:03:44.965 --> 01:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking in
a different direction.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Those particles would
not, on the average,

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.710 align:middle line:90%
see the first set of particles.

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So they would be
invisible to us.

01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Or we might see them
occasionally as quantum noise.

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:02.180 align:middle line:10%
That may well be the
origin of quantum noise.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.270 align:middle line:10%
So you end up with
a system, which

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:08.510 align:middle line:10%
you could think of like a
stack of sheets of paper.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And one sheet of paper is
like our physical universe.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The particles on
that sheet of paper

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are
synchronized with each other.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
We call that physical reality.

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:21.289 align:middle line:84%
That's what our current
physics tries to explain.

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
That's where our
laws are applicable.

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
But you can have many,
many other sheets

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
of paper with these
other parallel systems

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that are synchronized a
little bit differently.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, what raising the gauge,
and paranormal phenomena,

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and torsion and
these other forces

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that I've been talking
about, what they do

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
is they shift our
little sheet of paper.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So now we start to move down
and dip down and interact

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
with other parallel systems,
and that's what happens.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
When you can start now, instead
of being limited to a four

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
dimensional reality,
your dimensionality

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.917 align:middle line:84%
now could be five, six,
or seven dimensions

01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
as you interact with
other parallel systems.

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
strange things

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
become possible that
were not possible before.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> According to this
Synchronized Universe model,

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
when our own frequency
synchronizes with a parallel

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
universe, or dimension,
it allows us to proceed it

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a vision,
powers of levitation, miracles,

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, enlightenment,
and even healing.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are made of atoms
and subatomic particles.

01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
99.9% of our body
weight is comprised

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
of protons and
neutrons, which are then

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
made of hexagons of six quarks,
each made of dual pairs.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Among the quarks
are the mysterious

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.840 align:middle line:90%
strange and antistrange quark.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
They are called strange
because they have the ability

01:05:55.450 --> 01:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
to randomly just disappear from
the core of the atom and then

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
strangely reappear.

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
There is no mathematical model
to quantify the timing of when

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and why they will do this.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection to the
behavior of this strange quark

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:15.970 align:middle line:90%
and human consciousness?

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that we are also made
of a significant percentage

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
of strange quarks,
that portion of us

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is dematerializing and
rematerializing at random

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:29.410 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
No one has been
able to determine

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
where the strange quarks
travel to, other than the fact

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that they disappear into
other dimensions and reappear.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Do they travel to other
dimensions to gain information,

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.870 align:middle line:90%
or to communicate at a distance?

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
This behavior demonstrates
that part of our consciousness

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.050 align:middle line:84%
does travel into
other dimensions.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Can this help
explain communication

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
at a distance and
mental telepathy?

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
In the 1970s, President Carter,
the CIA, and the Air Force

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
used two psychics
trained in remote viewing

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to locate a lost Russian
Tu-22 bomber, which

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:14.350 align:middle line:90%
no other forces could find.

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewers gave blind
latitude longitude coordinates

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that led Air Force officials
to point their satellite

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
cameras deep into the
jungles of Africa,

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
precisely where the
Russian Tu-22 had crashed.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:35.110 align:middle line:10%
>> The significance of the case
where Carter talks about how

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:39.150 align:middle line:10%
remote viewers were used to find
the missing bomber who had gone

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:43.240 align:middle line:10%
down in the jungle shows that
remote viewing can be very

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.180 align:middle line:10%
accurate and can be useful.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.090 align:middle line:10%
His comments about the
case were a little bit

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:50.710 align:middle line:10%
of an oversimplification.

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There was more than one remote
viewer actually involved.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They do it several times
to check one another.

01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
remote viewing, number one,

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.690 align:middle line:90%
can be very accurate.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And number two,
it was really used

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
for important cases over
an extended period of time.

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
claim that it's finished

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.576 align:middle line:84%
and there's no more
remote viewing going on,

01:08:12.576 --> 01:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that's what they
said before they

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
admitted that this
program was there, too.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can make your own
conclusions about that.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
consciousness really

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
can be used to give us
information that might

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:28.830 align:middle line:90%
otherwise be unobtainable.

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Later, in 1979,
congressman Charles Rose,

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:36.819 align:middle line:84%
then chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Intelligence

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Evaluation, reviewed the US
government's secret psychic spy

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
program.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
He then warned that if the
Russians had this ability

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.448 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't pursue it further,
we would be in serious trouble.

01:08:52.448 --> 01:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there was certainly
plenty of evidence that the out

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
of body programs were going
on, the remote viewing programs

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.130 align:middle line:90%
were going on.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:03.470 align:middle line:90%


01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:07.279 align:middle line:84%
What has been made public is the
20 year remote viewing program

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that was started by
the CIA in the '70s

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.939 align:middle line:84%
that physicists had put off and
a couple of the people started.

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And they found out from
their early experiments,

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
they could go into
laboratories in Russia.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
laboratories was

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.689 align:middle line:84%
at Semipalatinsk, which
the CIA at that time

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:31.850 align:middle line:90%
had been unable to look into.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
They saw a building, large
structures, a lot of activity,

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
but they could not tell
what it was being used for.

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:42.470 align:middle line:10%
And so one of the
first successes

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.870 align:middle line:10%
that started the
program was when

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:47.600 align:middle line:10%
a man named Pat
Price remote viewed

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.880 align:middle line:10%
the inside of the facility.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.250 align:middle line:10%
He saw overhead cranes.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:55.160 align:middle line:10%
He saw overhead
cranes moving along

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.380 align:middle line:10%
overhead outside of
the building that

01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.900 align:middle line:10%
had railroad tracks on
each side of the building.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.080 align:middle line:10%
He saw these huge
steel spheres that

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.310 align:middle line:10%
were being cut with special
types of welding techniques.

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They were foot-thick
steel sections of spheres.

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
We had no way, at that time, of
welding such large structures,

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
but they developed a
technique to do so.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And by using his
remote viewing ability,

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.460 align:middle line:84%
he figured out that
these were going

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to become large underground
spheres to capture

01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:29.510 align:middle line:84%
the energy from explosions,
and then use the energy

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to make a beam weapon.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
This was part of the
Russian Beam Weapon program.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the
'80s, Ronald Reagan

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
started the Star Wars
program in an effort

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to counteract some
of this technology.

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
But the first inkling we had
that the Russians were involved

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
in this was Pat Price's remote
viewing back in 1974, '75.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> While the United States'
nuclear weapons program peak

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
in evolution was a 15
megaton nuclear bomb.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
The Russians were far superior
testing a 50 megaton hydrogen

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
bomb on October 30th, 1961.

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Was Russian psychic espionage
into the United States'

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.820 align:middle line:84%
secret weapons program
instrumental in allowing

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.190 align:middle line:90%
them to gain the advantage?

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Today, with the
Cold War at its end,

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Russian psychic research is
used for mostly peaceful means.

01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin Korotkov
is a professor

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
of physics at St. Petersburg
Tech University in Russia.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
He's the inventor of
the world's first camera

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that can see deep into the
human aura's energy field

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and information band.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It is called the GDV.

01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The computer software
reads the data

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that GDV provides on an
individual's auric field,

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and can see breaks
in the energy field,

01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
early signs of damage to
organs, and changes in the field

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
due to higher states
of consciousness,

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the amplitude of energy
coming out of all seven energy

01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
centers, how well the seven
energy centers communicate

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and even
mental telepathy and healing.

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:18.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So it was really a very
interesting fact because we

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:24.560 align:middle line:10%
were able to organize research
laboratory, research center,

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.820 align:middle line:10%
outside of the city
in some remote place.

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.640 align:middle line:10%
We took a house.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.960 align:middle line:10%
In this house, we put
all possible groups

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.640 align:middle line:10%
that we were able to
think of at that time.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.790 align:middle line:10%
And we had been
selecting and inviting

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:46.760 align:middle line:10%
people who was really
talented and clever,

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.220 align:middle line:10%
and talented psyche people.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we trained them how
to operate with each other,

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with different
processes of communications,

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and we've been
measuring this process.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was many sessions
like this, several years.

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting results.

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And ever since, we published
secret reports on this.

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's never been
published in any journal.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.525 align:middle line:84%
But we have proven that
telepathic communication

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:23.810 align:middle line:90%
with people is really possible.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was done on very
precise scientific basis.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But our approach was different
from approach of Russell Targ

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:38.390 align:middle line:90%
or some other social scientist.

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:42.800 align:middle line:84%
First step was to
select specific people,

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.950 align:middle line:84%
to find out people
who can do something

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and who communicate
with each other.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:52.790 align:middle line:10%
And I am absolutely sure that
really effective communication

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:55.100 align:middle line:10%
come between people
who are really

01:13:55.100 --> 01:14:00.780 align:middle line:10%
attuned to each other, who
have these very, very special

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.110 align:middle line:10%
integument to each other.

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.970 align:middle line:10%
It may be man, woman.

01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:06.140 align:middle line:10%
It may be man, man.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.590 align:middle line:10%
It may be woman, woman.

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:09.650 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.200 align:middle line:10%
It's not a gender difference.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:19.670 align:middle line:10%
It is a topic of, I would say,
spiritual interconnections.

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they have
it, then they may

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
be trained how to
interact with each other.

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So from our point of view,
when we've done this experiment

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and we are doing this
experiment up till now,

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
it is very important
to select people,

01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to train them, and
attune to each other.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Then it's maybe
effective communication.

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we receive messages from
others without even knowing it?

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.965 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the study to
show, is it possible to send

01:14:54.965 --> 01:15:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and quantify, measure
energy of healing,

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:03.670 align:middle line:90%
loving energy to sending?

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:08.540 align:middle line:10%
So if we sent loving
energy to another being who

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:14.590 align:middle line:10%
is not directly in front of
you, but in another space,

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:16.460 align:middle line:10%
will they receive it?

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And if they receive
it, how does it show?

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:15:21.431 --> 01:15:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That was the purpose.

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was done with a team
of researchers in Slovenia.

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%


01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So here, we see that you
have got the person who

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:38.180 align:middle line:90%
is sending energy.

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the right side,
the sending of energy.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And on this side is the
receiving of energy.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.430 align:middle line:10%
So from the right side,
when you talk about,

01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:49.880 align:middle line:10%
because the emotional heart is
on the right, it is sending.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.840 align:middle line:10%
So there is a little burst.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.575 align:middle line:10%
And of course, these
bursts are captured.

01:15:53.575 --> 01:15:55.215 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's severed
from the body.

01:15:55.215 --> 01:15:57.730 align:middle line:10%
This burst is leaving the body.

01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:58.606 align:middle line:10%
>> It is.

01:15:58.606 --> 01:15:59.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, that's amazing.

01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:03.420 align:middle line:10%
>> And the receiver
is receiving it.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And look at the
shape of that, too.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> How far away are they
physically from each other?

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Two buildings.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Two buildings?

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Two buildings.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So this burst of energy
traveled to buildings and went

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.640 align:middle line:90%
to--

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This person, who
was the receiver.

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is documented,
scientifically,

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.240 align:middle line:90%
as biophoton emissions.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If we attempt to send someone
we are tuned into a message

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
with our mind,
will they hear it?

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Will they receive it?

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Vertical, we have
instruments, on both people,

01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:45.310 align:middle line:90%
both sender and receiver.

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And they physically situated
in a different place.

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:54.290 align:middle line:10%
And it may be a different place
in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Or Moscow to St. Petersburg.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Or Himalaya to Moscow, then
Paulo to Moscow, Venezuela

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:03.240 align:middle line:90%
to Moscow.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So we did a lot of
experiments of this kind.

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
In any situation,
we have time that is

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.410 align:middle line:90%
related to astronomical time.

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's all now possible
by GPS to relate all this.

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:26.090 align:middle line:10%
And we were able, at the
emerging moment of sending,

01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:27.210 align:middle line:10%
emotion.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.310 align:middle line:10%
Because we're
sending not images,

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:34.740 align:middle line:10%
not some pictures, not letters,
but we are sending emotions.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And they aim to detect the
emotions on the other end.

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So we are measuring sending
and response from very physical

01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:middle line:90%
measurements.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:54.218 align:middle line:84%
This is electrophotography,
electrophotonics,

01:17:54.218 --> 01:17:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and balancing platform
so we can really

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
detect the movements of
sending and receiving.

01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And in all our experiments,
it didn't matter,

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.490 align:middle line:90%
that it is no time sheet.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Not?

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:09.140 align:middle line:90%
0?

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> 0.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Instantaneous action.

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.274 align:middle line:90%
Instantaneous effect.

01:18:12.274 --> 01:18:23.230 align:middle line:90%

>> As new science builds
a strong case for mental

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
telepathy that is faster
than the speed of light,

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
how will this instantaneous
communication at a distance

01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:38.750 align:middle line:84%
change our views and knowledge
about how powerful each

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and every one of us really is?

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>> That after all our
experiments of telepathy,

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.510 align:middle line:90%
it became clear, the principle.

01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:51.950 align:middle line:84%
You can contact any
person in the world

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
if you can attune yourself
to this particular person.

01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course it
needs some training.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It needs some imagination.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.800 align:middle line:84%
You should be trained
how to use it.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But in principle, it's
not very difficult.

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like, for
example, to make phone calls.

01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:17.395 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's boring, to
press buttons and it's busy,

01:19:17.395 --> 01:19:20.040 align:middle line:90%
line in again and it's busy.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So when I need to
contact someone,

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I just contact this
person in mindset,

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.340 align:middle line:90%
and they ask person to call me.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And it works very well.

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So people usually call
and contact somehow

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.020 align:middle line:90%
and it works very brilliant.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Could a telepathic message
be sent from the moon back

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:50.060 align:middle line:90%
to Earth?

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, Apollo 14 astronaut
Edgar Mitchell believed

01:19:55.850 --> 01:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the powers of the human
aura and mental telepathy

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
were so profound, he
conducted an experiment

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.370 align:middle line:84%
while he was on his way
back to Earth from the moon.

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:10.010 align:middle line:90%


01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, one
of our team of two astronauts

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
who were the last group, I
think, to walk on the moon.

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the third group
to walk on the moon.

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
On his way back, decided to
do a psychic communication

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.990 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
He didn't tell his
superiors about it,

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
but he'd arranged with several
psychics on the ground back

01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:35.060 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth to
try to send them

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%
psychic messages about cards.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a set of cards
called the Zener cards which

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.130 align:middle line:90%
have patterns on them.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And during several intervals
on the way back from the moon,

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
he was 200,000 miles
or more from the Earth,

01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and some of those times he
would send these signals back

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:57.230 align:middle line:90%
to psychics on the earth.

01:20:57.230 --> 01:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
When he got back,
he compared to what

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.610 align:middle line:84%
he was sending with
what they picked up,

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and the answers that they had
received were accurate enough.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
They were well above
chance and they

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
were showing that
ESP was working, even

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.500 align:middle line:90%
over those large distances.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So at our present
time, it appears

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
as though we don't
know of any limits,

01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
in terms of distance or time
for psychic communication.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:27.787 align:middle line:90%
