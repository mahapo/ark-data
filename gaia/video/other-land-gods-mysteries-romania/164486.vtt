What do we know of this country?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:90%
In reality, very little.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
However, we've become aware

traditions and histories.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%

ancient sanctions,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
mysterious treasures, and
unusual archaeological objects

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%

the Earth with giants?

1,200 meters up--

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that's 4,000 feet--
a century that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
attests to the presence of
an ancient civilization,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
the Dacians.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%

established truth.

Sarmizegetusa, known as
the Romanian Stonehenge,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
is listed by UNESCO as
a World Heritage site.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Now in ruins, this
sanctuary was once

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
the ancient capital
of the Dacians,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the original
peoples of Romania.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
This military
supply fortress was

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
comprised of five terraces
that extended to more

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
than 30,000 square meters.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Inside are contained living
accommodation, stables,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and storage facilities, all
served by a complex water

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
supply system.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
The city temples did
not survive the wars.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Only fragments of undersides
rock proves their presence.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Archeological excavations attest
that the inhabitants enjoyed

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:90%
a high standard of living.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:10%
Here the buildings benefited
from modern installations

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:10%
a long time before the Romans
interfered with the Dacian

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:10%
culture.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But Sarmizegetusa was much
more than a simple city.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
The Dacians took their knowledge
from an influential priest,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Deceneus.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Initiated in Egypt to the same
degree as Thales, Pythagoras,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and Plato, some credit
him with the building

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.075 align:middle line:84%
of the city during
the first century BCE.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Sarmizegetusa was also the site
of an astronomical observatory.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It is said that the
priests mastered cosmology

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and established the
positions of the planets.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Their signs of the
stars governed decisions

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
relating to future wars,
the cultivation of the land,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and voyages to undertake.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The largest sanctum in the
citadel measures 30 meters,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
98.5 feet, in diameter and is
composed of three concentric

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
This astronomical temple
doubled as a calendar,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
reputed to have been one of the
most precise in all antiquity,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
with a margin of error of one
hour, 15 minutes, and three

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:90%
seconds per year.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Next to it, a circular
andesite flagstone

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
comprised of 10 spokes
acted as a solar dial

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that allowed the Dacians
to predict the solstices

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and equinoxes.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Historians know very
little about the Dacians

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and attribute to them a very
limited degree of knowledge.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Many affirmed that they did
not possess the written word.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This polemic affirmation
divides many researchers.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84%
According to some,
it is impossible

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
for a so-called
primitive civilization

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to have knowledge of
stars and science.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
However, one very
controversial discovery

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.825 align:middle line:84%
attests that they were not
as archaic as history states.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:10%
Discovered in 1875 under
the reign of King Carol I,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:10%
the tablets of Sinaia suggest
that the Dacians did, in fact,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:10%
possess the written word.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
500 of these tablets were found
at the end of the 19th century

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
during the construction
of the castle of Pelisor.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Originally fashioned
in gold, they

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
show three different
types of writing.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
One resembles a form
of ancient Greek,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
but the other two
remain unknown.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
To get the gold,
King Carol had copies

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.725 align:middle line:84%
of them made in lead before
melting down the originals.

by historians.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It is inconceivable
for them that they

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
could assemble three
different styles of writing.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.672 align:middle line:84%
More so, if we have not
discovered similar writings,

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%

been invented.

They cannot be authentic.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:84%
For historians, they
were just a joke.

of these tablets linked

to their containing a message

Dacians were not so primitive.

But what were they really?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
In Romania, the Dacian
people speak a lot about it.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But according to
historians, it is as

though they came from nowhere.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
To understand their origins,
we must go back to an era

where the Thracian territory
extended east to modern day

the Dacians, known as the
Getae by the ancient Greeks

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.289 align:middle line:90%
in modern day Romania.

00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, the most
logical explanation

is that the Emperor

00:26:09.637 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the presence of these
thorn bushes in the trenches

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
just a coincidence, or did
they put them there to hide

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
the excavations?

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Have we found what we
are looking for here,

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
or have we discovered more
than we were hoping for?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Some places bear witness
to crude excavations.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.629 align:middle line:84%
Some ceramics from
the Dacian culture

00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:31.795 align:middle line:90%
are scattered on the ground.

00:26:31.795 --> 00:26:57.142 align:middle line:90%

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It is while searching for
these ceramics that we made

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:90%
a macabre discovery.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to know
more about these bones

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and so asked at
the nearby church.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:84%
The priest who greeted
us said that he

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that there were
human remains buried there.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
He seemed annoyed, and
we were a little put

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:90%
off by his indifference.

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.840 align:middle line:84%
What heavy secret is
buried in Argedava?

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Are there other
bodies buried there?

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
This ancient city though is
not the only place in Romania

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
where the discovery of giant
skeletons has been reported.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Other similar discoveries
have been documented

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.420 align:middle line:10%
In opening this
sensitive file, we

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:10%
realize that there
are numerous witnesses

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:10%
to these giant skeletons.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:84%
One of them led us south,
on the River Danube.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:84%
In the southwest
of Romania, close

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to the border with
Serbia, a sculptor

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:84%
alleges to have seen one
of these giant skeletons

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:90%
with his own eyes.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:90%
He is called Nicolae Pascu Goya.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.180 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
1960s, he accompanied

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
an archaeologist
said to have found

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
a passage under the
Danube and discovered

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:84%
a village of disproportionate
dimensions there.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Now deceased, his
incredible testimony

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
was confided in
us by Uri Florio.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Six years ago, he worked
for a review magazine

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
on alternative subjects.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued by the
history of this old man,

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:90%
he decided to meet him.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
He won't easily forget
the 2nd of June, 2010.

from the interview with Nicolae

Pascu Goya.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
They were recorded
by Uri and his team

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.797 align:middle line:84%

death of the sculptor.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the sculptor,
the layout of the tools

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and the skeletons were
not insignificant.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
All were perfectly
arranged insomuch

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.169 align:middle line:84%
that they could be said
to have been exhibited.

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it is
difficult to believe

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:90%
in this story of giants.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Oral traditions are
abound with the existence

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
of a legendary people
of gigantic proportions.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:84%
We recall that it in the past,
in the province of Neamt,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
giants occupied the
Ceahlau Mountains,

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:84%
a sacred place that each year
attracts thousands of pilgrims.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:33:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:84%
In former times, the colossi
that inhabited these mountains

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.410 align:middle line:84%
were the ancestors
of the Dacians.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:84%
These peaceful beings
measured 2.5 meters,

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:84%
eight foot three inches,
and lived through breeding.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They were strong
and fair and had

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:84%
knowledge qualified as magic
by the men of the valley.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
However, one day
during a harsher winter

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.280 align:middle line:84%
than normal, a strange
illness decimated them all.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The Ceahlau Mountains
are a holy place

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and enclose the treasure
of the giant people.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It is said that only those
of a pure heart and soul,

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
exempt from sin, can
approach these riches.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.892 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.892 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Mount Ceahlau would
be the entrance

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of the house of the gods
once used by the Dacians

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to bring them closer
to their gods.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.210 align:middle line:84%
However, away from
the oral traditions,

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Mount Ceahlau is a
place of devotion.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Each year on the morning of
August the 6th, 1,000 believers

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.260 align:middle line:84%
start a pilgrimage
in order to take part

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:90%
in an unusual phenomenon.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
On the 46th morning after
the summer solstice,

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:84%
the sun projects a shadow
of a perfect pyramid.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It is formed by the
union of shadows

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of the peaks of
Panaghea and Toaca.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:84%
When the sun rises, it starts
by projecting the shadow

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:84%
at the peak of Toaca,
then encompasses that

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:84%
with the shadow of
the peak of Panaghea.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.100 align:middle line:84%
This fusion gives
rise to the hologram

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.699 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid of Ceahlau.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:39.300 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere within this area, the
shadow casts over the entrance

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to a kingdom of
unimaginable riches.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The more that we dive into
the myth of this area,

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:84%
the more we learn about
these giant people.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
In the center of
Romania, a monastery

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.876 align:middle line:84%
built on the side of a
small mountain shelters

00:35:01.876 --> 00:35:03.375 align:middle line:84%
the remains of one
of these colossi.

00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And there we saw the
giants, the sons of Anak,

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.580 align:middle line:84%
which came of the
giants, and we were

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:84%
in our own sight
as grasshoppers,

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and so we were in their sight.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:84%
In the small community
of Corbii de Piatra,

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.970 align:middle line:84%
a monastery arouses
interest in believers.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:56.582 align:middle line:84%
This assembly of partially dug
caves dates back to 1512 AD.

00:35:56.582 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Their uncommon
layout seems to have

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
been inspired by 10th century
Byzantine church halls.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It is thought that
the two altars inside

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
would have served both
Catholic and orthodox services.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:84%
On the exterior, on the
side of the rock face,

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
there are intriguing
holes and huge cracks.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Close to the entrance
of the monastery,

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:84%
an artificial cavity serves
as the priest's refectory.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
At the far end, there's an
alveolus in the form of a bell.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.784 align:middle line:84%
This curious opening
appears to have

00:36:27.784 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:84%
been dug in order that something
larger could be inserted.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
A little further on, we
find a local curiosity.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:84%
The monks of the
monastery sometimes

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:84%
like to lead tourists
on foot to something

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.275 align:middle line:84%
that some believe to be the
petrified remains of a giant.

00:36:45.275 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Imagine a village where
there's nothing else and this

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:10%
monk sends you to a yard which
is kind of next door to a very

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.890 align:middle line:10%
old, old house.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And behind the
house in the yard,

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:90%
there is a sedimentary wall.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And in this wall,
you can see what

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:15.080 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the perfectly
mummified body of a very

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:90%
tall person.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.970 align:middle line:84%
It's laying face
down like it fell.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And the legend says it's a giant
that fell when the flood came.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:84%
You can tell exactly the foot,
the ankle, the entire hip area,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and then the torso.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
The head of this thing
fell off the cliff

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.220 align:middle line:84%
when the water washed away
this supposedly mummified body,

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's in the grass.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> For those who believe they
are seeing the relic of a true

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:84%
giant, the attraction of
Corbii de Piatra appears like

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:90%
a sculpture built into the rock.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Some see the remains
of a leg, for others

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.870 align:middle line:90%
it is a work of nature.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:84%
However, these cavities
and holes in the wall

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
strengthen the idea that this
sculpture may not be natural.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:84%
At our feet, stones
that have broken away

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:84%
have a very
evocative appearance.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The part of the petrified
giant that fell in the grass,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
there's the skull, the
shape of a human head.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
came apart from
the skull as well.

is that one of the eyes

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:90%

I don't know, I would call it
an extraterrestrial being skull.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.260 align:middle line:84%
To better understand
this myth, we must dive

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.340 align:middle line:84%
into the Mesopotamian
poem, "Atra-Hasis."

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.700 align:middle line:84%
This tale teaches us of the
existence of the Anunnaki gods

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and their servants, the Igigi,
known also as the little gods.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Outraged by their
condition in life,

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.670 align:middle line:84%
the Igigi rose up
against their masters.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.040 align:middle line:84%
In order to put down
the revolt, the god Enki

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.020 align:middle line:84%
created man, the slave
to serve all the gods.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It was conceived in the
image of the Anunnakis

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and born from clay mixed with
the blood of a sacrificed god.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It was the goddess Mami who was
charged with the fabrication

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:90%
of this divine paste.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:13.680 align:middle line:84%
She needed it to make seven

three baked clay tablets

an animal with a corn,

Under the pretext that the
ceramics were too soft,

them in an oven.

the Tartaria signs were simply

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%

how people can do 18 kilometers
tracks on the mountain.

an unexplained vitality.

what has been said.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The Aiud artifact was

deep in a layer
of petrified sand

containing the bones of
a prehistoric animal.

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:09.260 align:middle line:10%
Its composition is a
derivative or Duralumin

that is unlike any
variant known today.

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The object does not correspond
to any piece of a Messerschmitt

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%

crashed in the area.

If we consider its
archaeological context,

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%

Why denigrate the knowledge

And why reject the

01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:53.294 align:middle line:84%
prove to be one of the biggest

civilizations and also with
certain edifications that have

01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:25.660 align:middle line:10%
been found around the world
a common knowledge that some

01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:30.060 align:middle line:10%
civilizations have
had on all continents.

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But there also exists within
a large number of cultures

01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:35.670 align:middle line:84%
a detail that suggests
that all these people had

01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:37.410 align:middle line:90%
a common reference.

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:38.835 align:middle line:84%
We note it in a
number of ceramics

and in multiple representations.

And what if it was the
beginning of an answer?

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.780 align:middle line:84%
We speak of a strange
and evocative face

01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that will be the distinctive
symbol of the past divinities,

01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
a strong symbol, witness
of a powerful authority

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and known on all the
continents of the planet.

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.891 align:middle line:84%
All these faces evoking
the owl have beady eyes

01:33:00.891 --> 01:33:02.099 align:middle line:90%
and pronounced eyebrows.

a significant aspect

of the Mesopotamian idols.

01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:13.640 align:middle line:84%
We believe all these
faces, these divinities

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:17.810 align:middle line:84%
could have had a great
influence on all cultures.

01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything we have is in the
writings, the ancient texts

01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:24.860 align:middle line:84%

and reinterpretation.

01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the light of
what they reveal to us,

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:31.640 align:middle line:84%
we are forced to recognize that
these past civilizations were

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.980 align:middle line:90%
remarkably imaginative.

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:38.370 align:middle line:84%
If, as the ancient writings say,
giants once trod on our planet,

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
we understand the
interest highly placed

01:33:40.130 --> 01:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%

all these discoveries.

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, this is one
of the issues here because we

01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:55.020 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough
archaeological research.

01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And the authorities should be
helped to get European funds

01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and find out some
more about what

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:05.182 align:middle line:90%
they have in their backyard.
