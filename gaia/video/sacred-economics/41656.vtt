>> Any time you want to
understand something,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:84%
why is such and such happening,
why is there a biodiversity

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:84%
crisis, or why are we
drilling for more oil when

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:84%
it's polluting the atmosphere
and causing oil spills, why?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:90%
And you ask why?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And down a couple levels of why,
you always get to the money.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I talk a lot
about the story of self

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:90%
that every culture has.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.782 align:middle line:84%
And it answers the
question what are you?

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:90%
What is it to be human?

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So it says that you're
this separate being

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
among other separate
beings in a universe that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
is separate from yourself
as well, like you're not me.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
That plant is not me.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:90%
That's something separate.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And this story of self
really creates our world.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.428 align:middle line:84%
If you're a separate
self, and there's

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
other separate selves out there,
and other species out there,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and the universe
is fundamentally

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
indifferent to you
or even hostile,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
then you definitely
want to control.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You want to be able to have
power over other beings

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and over these whimsical,
arbitrary forces of nature that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
could extinguish
you at any time.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:90%
This story is becoming obsolete.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming no longer true.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't resonate
with it anymore.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
generating crises

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that are insoluble from
the methods of control.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
clearing space,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
clearing the space for us to
step into a new story of self

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:90%
and a new story of the people.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:12.189 align:middle line:90%

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, money is an agreement.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have
value all by itself.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:10%
It has value because people
agree that it has value.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Economists will tell
you what money does.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.175 align:middle line:90%
It facilitates exchange.

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
You use it to count things
and keep track of things.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, you write some numbers
on a magical piece of paper

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.660 align:middle line:90%
called a check.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can cause all
kinds of abundant goods

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
to come to your house.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And you could even cause
misery for thousands of people

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:84%
if you are one of
the highest initiates

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
of the magic of money.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Scarcity is built
into the money system.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:10%
On a most obvious level,
it's because of the way

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:10%
money is created as
interest-bearing debt.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So anytime a bank lends money
into existence or the Federal

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Reserve creates money,
the money comes along

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
with a corresponding
amount of debt.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And the debt, because
there's interest on it,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is always greater than
the amount of money.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So it essentially throws
people into competition

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
with each other for
never enough money.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.323 align:middle line:84%
Growth is another thing that's
built into our money system.

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:10%
If you're a bank, you're going
to lend to the person who's

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:10%
going to create new goods and
services so they can profit

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:10%
and they can pay you back.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to lend
to somebody who doesn't

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:10%
create goods and services.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.988 align:middle line:10%
So money goes toward those who
will create even more of it.

00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But, basically,
economic growth means

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that you have to find
something that was once nature

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
and make it into a good.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Or it was once a
gift relationship

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and make it into a service.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
You have to find something
that people once got for free

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
or did for themselves
or for each other

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and then take it away and
sell it back to them somehow.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
By turning things
into commodities,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
we get cut off from
nature in the same way

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:90%
as we're cut off from community.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We look at nature with eyes
of it's just a bunch of stuff.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And that leaves us very
lonely and leaves us

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
with many basic human
needs that go unmet.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
money, you might try

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to fill this hunger
through purchasing,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
through buying things, or
through accumulating money

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, now we're
nearing the end of growth.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The planet can't sustain
much more growth.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the crisis that
we have today won't go away.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.147 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.147 --> 00:05:00.033 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I talk about
is the sense of wrongness

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:90%
that I had as a child.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I think most kids
have some sense of it

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that it's not supposed to be
this way, just for example,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that you're not supposed
to actually hate Monday

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and be happy when you
don't have to go to school,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.365 align:middle line:84%
like school should be
something that you love.

00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Life should be
something that you love.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We didn't earn any of the
things that really keep us alive

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:90%
or that make life good.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
We didn't earn air.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:90%
We didn't earn being born.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:90%
We didn't earn our conception.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
We didn't earn being
able to breathe.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
We didn't earn having a
planet that can provide food.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:90%
We didn't earn the sun.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think that on
some level, people

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:90%
have this inborn gratitude.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Because on some
level, we know that we

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:90%
didn't earn any of this.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
We know that life is a gift.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you know that
you've received a gift,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
then the natural response
is gratitude, the desire

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to give in turn.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:10%
In a gift economy,
it's not true the way

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:10%
it is in our money economy
that everybody's in competition

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:10%
with everybody else.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
In a gift society, if you
have more than you need,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you give it to
somebody who needs it.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:90%
That's how you get status.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's even where
security comes from.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:10%
Because if you build
up all that gratitude,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:10%
then people are going
to take care of you too.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And if there are no gifts,
then there's no community.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can see as society's
become more monetized

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:90%
that communities disappear.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:90%
People long for it.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But you can't just have
community as an add-on

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.558 align:middle line:90%
to a monetized life.

00:06:49.558 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually
need each other.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.090 align:middle line:10%
People desire to
enact their gifts.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And if they were free from
money, they would do it.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:90%
But money is so often a barrier.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:84%
People think, oh,
I'd love to do this.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:90%
But can I afford to do it?

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it practical?

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Money stops them.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
What beautiful thing
what would I do?

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:90%
What am I called to do?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Would it be to set up big
gardens for homeless people

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to take care of and
reconnect them to nature?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Would it be to clean
up a toxic waste site?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Like what would you do?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
What beautiful
thing would you do?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And why isn't it practical
to do these things?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.808 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't there money
in those things?

An economy that embodies
the principles of the gift

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is an economy that is simply
grounded in the truth.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The task before us
is to align money

with the true
expression of our gifts.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
It requires a very
different mechanism

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of money
and the circulation of money.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:10%
They include things like
negative interest, which

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:10%
reverses the effects of usury.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They include things like
the internalization of costs

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
no longer pollute

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and have somebody else or future
generations pay the costs.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:10%
They include a social
dividend, sharing

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:10%
in the wealth that
comes from what

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:10%
should be the commons,
the land, the aquifers,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:10%
our cultural heritage.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:10%
They include a relocalization
of a lot of economic functions.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They include all kinds
of peer-to-peer financing

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:90%
and the peer-to-peer revolution.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
What will it take to shift away
from the current money system?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the current money system
just works less and less well.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.425 align:middle line:84%
Growth can only be maintained
at a higher and higher cost.

00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Even our best efforts
can't keep the economy

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
growing as fast as it needs
to for the system to work.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And that creates further misery.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
People just can't
take it anymore.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Even the people on
top, even the winners

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
of this artificially-induced
competition,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:90%
they're not happy either.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not working
for them either.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we're going to
see a series of crisis moments,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
each one more severe
than the last.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:10%
And at each crisis moment,
we'll have a collective choice.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Do we give up the game
and join the people?

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Or do we hold on even tighter?

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:36.038 align:middle line:84%
It's really up to us to
determine at what point

00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:90%
this wake up point will happen.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.632 align:middle line:90%
Was this all a big mistake?

00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And it sure seems like it was
sometimes when you look around

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
at just the hoarders that
have taken place on this Earth

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.663 align:middle line:90%
and that are ongoing right now.

00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And some people think, I just
don't want any part of this.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Civilization was a huge mistake.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I came to see this whole journey
of separation not as a mistake,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
but as part of a larger process.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:10%
It started, I think, with
the environmental movement

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:10%
in the 1960s.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That was its first awakening
into mass consciousness.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And the astronauts
went up and experienced

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:90%
the pinnacle of separation.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And the photos that got beamed
down, even today, it still

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:90%
evokes love in us.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're falling
in love with Earth.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
That's one part of our
transition into adulthood.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.830 align:middle line:84%
The other part is the
coming of age ordeal

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
when the old world falls
apart and a new world is born.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:90%
A child plays.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
A child plays and
develops his or her gifts

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't apply them toward
their true purpose yet.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what humanity
has been doing, playing

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:84%
with our gifts of
technology and culture

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and developing these gifts.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Now we're coming into adulthood.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's time to apply
them to our true purpose.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, I think
that'll be simply heal

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
the damage that's been done.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of healing
that needs to be done.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
impossible actually.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
You could say
that, really, we're

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
in the business of creating
a miracle here on Earth.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying it's
something that is

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.993 align:middle line:84%
impossible from an old
understanding of reality

00:11:39.993 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:90%
but possible from a new one.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's necessary.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.213 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, anything less than
that isn't even worth trying.

00:11:48.213 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:90%
