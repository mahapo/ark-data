a prominent religious
scholar named

Jalal ad-Din Rumi was suddenly
separated from his teacher

and spiritual friend.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Verses of poetry began pouring
out of him, remarkable poetry.

the words down.

The Sufis are an
ancient spiritual order,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and according to many Sufis,
the essential truths of Sufism

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:90%
exist in all religions.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>The Sufis are
a remarkable band

in the history of religions.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:90%
They are the mystics of Islam.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:10%
And as the mystics
of Islam, the Sufi

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:10%
we can connect with,
because they're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:10%
talking about these wonderful,
sublime truths which

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:10%
have a way of piercing directly
into the human heart, wherever

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:10%
it is.

visiting in all of the
great religions, really.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's part of
the nature of this kind

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:90%
of fluid imagination.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
It crosses boundaries.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
It penetrates and
it even slips by,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and it works by way of humor.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:10%
It works by way of
stunning imagery.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:10%
It works in many
different ways as

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:10%
if to keep bringing people
to some deep human well.

of the learning community.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
His life seems to have
been a fairly normal one

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
for a religious
scholar-- teaching,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
meditating, helping the poor--
until the late fall of 1244,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
when he met a stranger, a
wandering dervish, Shams

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:90%
of Tabriz.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Rumi's genius was triggered
by an actual human being,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
an encounter with this
mysterious figure,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Shams of Tabriz.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>>He was an intense,
fierce, mountain meditator.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Those kind of people, like
Thoreau magnified five times.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>The connection
between Shams and Rumi

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great
stories of learning

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and what we nowaday
call mentoring.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost of an
order beyond what people

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
mean when they mean
to learn from someone,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
because it means to almost--
what seemed to happen

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:90%
was a sudden knowing.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>One can see here
in Shams an older man

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
who is outside the orthodox
spiritual community who

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
comes in and helps
a younger man who

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is deeply embedded in that
orthodox spiritual community.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
kind of explosion.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>What Rumi says, he says, he
was raw, then he got cooked.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
And then he was burned.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:10%
And that means when his heart
only melted through his love

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:10%
for Shams, that this
new experience enabled

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:10%
him to understand what he
was talking about before.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:10%
>>And he took Rumi's
book knowledge and says,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:10%
now, you have to live what
you've been reading about.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:10%
Pushed all his books
into the fountain,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:10%
that's one story
of how they met.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And Rumi and he went off
into this practice called

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
conversation, or sohbet,
in which they disappeared

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
for evidently for
weeks at a time

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation between
the personal and the deep self.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.865 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is the poem "I'm
Not Saying This Right,"

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, might
mean that I might not

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:90%
say the poem right.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not saying this right.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
"You bind me, and I
tear away in a rage

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to open out into air, a
round brightness, a candle

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:90%
point, all reason, all love.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
This confusing
joy is your doing,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
this hangover your
tender thought.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:90%
You turn to look, I turn.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying this right.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm a jailed crazy who
ties up spirit women.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm Solomon.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
What goes, come back.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:90%
What goes comes back.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Come back.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:90%
We never left each other.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:84%
A disbeliever hides
all disbelief.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
But I will say his secret now.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
More and more awake,
getting up at night,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
spinning and falling
in love with Shams,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
falling with love for Shams,
spinning and spinning.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Falling in love with Shams.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Falling with love for Shams.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Falling with love for Shams."

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>And so Rumi became a poet
then, became a real poet,

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:90%
became infused.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:90%
The whole spirit came into him.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the great
love affairs of the world,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
the one between Shams and Rumi.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And they loved each
other, not sexually,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
but they loved each
other in the heart.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Why does it impress
people so much?

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.452 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a love
that is beyond gender,

00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
beyond age, beyond
sex, beyond species.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It is the essence of love.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:10%
>>Two oceans met each other
in the force of love of God,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:10%
because the earth
has many oceans.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:90%
All the time, they meet.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And ones happened to meet in
the land of Konya, Turkey,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:90%
700 years ago.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.648 align:middle line:84%
>>"When you feel your lips
becoming infinite and sweet

00:08:48.648 --> 00:09:03.701 align:middle line:84%
like a moon in a sky, when you
feel that spaciousness inside,

00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:08.148 align:middle line:84%
Shams of Tabriz
will be there, too.

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Something opens our wings.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.441 align:middle line:84%
Something makes boredom
and hurt disappear.

00:09:33.441 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Someone fills the
cup in front of us.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:90%
We taste only sacredness."

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>>The relationship
between Rumi and Shams

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:10%
is actually a reminder to us
that all relationships have

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:10%
that potential and that
when we fall in love,

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:10%
then we actually are entering a
spiritual domain of awareness.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Romantic lovers are confused.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a very spiritual
state, to be confused.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Rumi says himself.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:84%
He says, label me and
define me, and you'll

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:90%
starve yourself of yourself.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Nail me down in a
box with cold words,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and that box will
be your coffin.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't know who I am.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm in astounding,
lucid confusion.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the state of love.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a lot of jealousy
among Rumi's students

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:90%
over this.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Jealousy is one of the main
impulses in the human race,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So no one knows
exactly the truth,

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
but some feel that what happened
is that the students killed

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Shams, hid the body.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Rumi then went out
in the backyard,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and there was a pole there.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And in his grief, he kept
going round and round

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and round and round the pole,
and this is the beginning

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.709 align:middle line:90%
of the whirling dervishes.

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was done
out of grief, which

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:90%
is terrifically interesting.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
That's how all that
great poetry started,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
was in grief, the thing
that we avoid the most, hmm?

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, he would
begin to speak the lines,

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:90%
speak them out.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
They'd all appear in rhyme
and meter, perfectly done.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when he came out, the
students would say, oh, my god.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:90%
That was tremendous.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Write that down.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:90%
No, he said.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:90%
No, let's keep dancing.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:90%
That's only words.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Rumi says that everything
is for the beloved.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything is for the friend.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
of that is that there

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
is a presence that
we feel in the beauty

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:90%
that we see outside of us.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:90%
We feel it in a November sunset.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We feel it in a child
sleeping, in a child dancing,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:90%
playing soccer.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.265 align:middle line:84%
We feel it in a group of friends
making supper on Sunday night.

00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
He would say that feeling
is a presence that

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is both outside of us and
tending us and inside us.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
When we feel the
jewel-like quality

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of our own inner awareness,
that also is the friend.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And this inner outer presence
is addressed directly

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
in many of Rumi's poems.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
When he says that
wonderful pronoun "you"

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and you don't quite know who
it is, it's that presence.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
"When it's cold and raining," he
says, "you are more beautiful,

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and the snow brings me
even closer to your lips.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
The inner secret, that
which was never born.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You are that freshness,
and I am with you now.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain the
goings or the comings.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
You enter suddenly,
and I am nowhere again,

00:14:02.420 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:90%
inside the majesty."

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:90%
"I. You.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.595 align:middle line:90%
He.

00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:41.395 align:middle line:90%
She.

00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:90%
We.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
In the garden of
mystical lovers,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:59.343 align:middle line:90%
these are not true distinctions.

00:15:59.343 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.427 align:middle line:90%
I. You.

00:16:05.427 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:90%
He.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:90%
She.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:90%
We."

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>I feel very grateful
to Coleman Barks

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
for having introduced me to
a world that I knew existed,

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that I yearned
for, that there was

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
an agony of wishing
in my heart, but I

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%
didn't know how to find it.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I had found it through other
means, through other poets,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.382 align:middle line:84%
but never with the intensity
and passion of Rumi.

00:16:51.382 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So I owe a great
debt of gratitude

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to Coleman Barks to
bringing me to that world.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>We know Rumi
through his poetry.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:10%
But in a sense, it
isn't his poetry,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:10%
because his poetry
was in Persian, Farsi,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:10%
and we read him in English.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And the difficulties,
the problems,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:84%
also the mysterious
connection that

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:84%
occurs, but also a
distance in translation,

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
is an abiding factor
for all translators,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.212 align:middle line:90%
but especially for poets.

00:17:36.212 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:10%
>>The first time I
ever heard of Rumi

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.225 align:middle line:10%
was at one of Robert
Bly's conferences

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:10%
in 1976 when he handed me a
book of scholarly translations

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:10%
by AJ Arberry and he
said, these-- these poems

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:10%
need to be released from
their cages, you know.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I began rephrasing
Arberry's English.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of that,
a sequence of coincidences

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
happened, and I met a Sufi
teacher, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:90%
And he told me to do this work.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And if I had not sat in his
presence for about nine years

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
on and off, I would have
no idea what Rumi was about

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:90%
or what he did.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe in both
translations and versions.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:10%
In a translation,
one has to know

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:10%
the language-- for
example, Spanish

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:10%
when you translate Neruda.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And then Neruda's contemporary,
and so you can feel the turns.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the sorrow,
where it is in the sentence,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and which words have tremendous
sorrow, even in Spanish,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:90%
and continue them.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you follow the
emotional mood of that line.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And then as a translator, I'm
responsible for the accuracy.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I still may make many mistakes.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I will always find a speaker
who knew Spanish and English

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
in the cradle, because that's
where the sounds are first

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:90%
heard.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
A version is a
different thing for me.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:90%
I found Kabir.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.447 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were so
fantastic that I thought, well,

00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
what did this sound like
if it were written today?

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:90%
So I made a guess at the lines.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:90%
And they're not accurate.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:90%
You're making a guess.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing it
up to modern times.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You're putting in, so-- but
the aim of those translations,

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
the aim of versions, is
bringing in poets so unusual, so

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
amazing, that you'd rather
have an inaccurate translation

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:90%
than none at all.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I work with scholars
who give me literal versions

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:90%
of poems from the Persian.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The more literal,
the better for me.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So John Moyne and evidently
Reynold Nicholson's translation

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
of the "Masnavi"
is very literal.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I take what they give me,
which is literal English,

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and then try to make a poem
that's valid in American right

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:10%
So I put it into
our tradition which

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:10%
is most attuned to
spiritual questions,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:10%
and that is the free
verse of Whitman

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:10%
and Emily Dickinson
and Gary Snyder.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
musicality of the Persian,

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
we don't try to
reproduce that at all.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's densely rhymed within words
and within the middle words,

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's almost
unreproducible in English.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.314 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING PERSIAN]

00:21:32.314 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's quite difficult to
understand, and easy as well.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>The more translators
work on a text, the better.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:10%
Because every version
gives you something else,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:10%
because it's through the
eye of that particular poet

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:10%
or translator.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
He sees more this word
or more that version.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:10%
>>But somehow, the cork comes
out of the bottle again,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:10%
and the genie is
out, so to speak.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:10%
You know, a reference to an
old story where it's uncorked

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:10%
and the spirit of the
thing comes to life again,

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:10%
which has certainly happened
through Coleman Barks, Robert

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:10%
Bly, and the other translators.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Rumi can keep and should
keep a lot of translators busy,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
because he is a kind of universe
with a lot of different moods

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and modes, and I may be
missing a lot of them.

We have now been pulled out.

it'll always have
in it that grief

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%

can't make the flute music

And then it can make
language when it's separated.

Therefore, language is a
proof that we're separated.

He would cup his hand around

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:84%
They're in concert with the
galaxies and the molecules

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
that go like this.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've always
loved about the Sufis.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.510 align:middle line:84%
They say that the
great world is inside.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:84%
This world that looks
so huge and magnificent

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:90%
is the microcosm.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:90%
The macrocosm is our inner life.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It just reverses science.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the new science is
saying something like that.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The inner world
is the giant place

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and the world, the
outside world that we see,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:84%
is the language that we
use to speak of the inner.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>If you look deeply
enough, actually,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.100 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of
science itself,

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
we might discover that what
Rumi and other great seers

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and sages and the wisdom
traditions were saying

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:90%
was actually true.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:10%
At the heart of
creation, there is

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:10%
only that feel of love, that
ultimately even our material

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:10%
success comes from the ability
to love and have compassion,

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:10%
comes from the capacity to
experience joy and ecstasy

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:10%
and share it with others.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.406 align:middle line:84%
>>"Inside water, a
water wheel turns.

00:37:00.406 --> 00:37:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:08.289 align:middle line:90%
A star circulates with the moon.

00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.445 align:middle line:84%
We live in this night
ocean, wondering.

00:37:16.445 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:90%
What are these lights?

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.681 align:middle line:84%
I am so small, I
can barely be seen.

00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.484 align:middle line:84%
How can this great
love be inside me?

00:37:52.484 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Look at your eyes.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.948 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
They're small, but they
see enormous things."

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Rumi says, "On
resurrection day,

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.870 align:middle line:90%
your body testifies against you.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Your hand says, 'I
stole money.' Your lips,

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:33.640 align:middle line:84%
'I said meanness.' Your feet,
'I went were I shouldn't.' Your

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:84%
genitals, 'Me, too.' These
voices will make your praying

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
sound hypocritical, so let the
body's doings speak openly now

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.870 align:middle line:84%
without your saying a word,
as a student walking behind

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.270 align:middle line:84%
a teacher says, 'This one
knows more clearly than I

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:84%
the way.'" That's an
amazing thing at the end,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that your body in certain ways
knows your way to the spirit

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.080 align:middle line:90%
better than your mind does.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And the body forgives
a great deal, you know?

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:14.180 align:middle line:10%
>>Rumi gives the way to
live better, to love more,

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.600 align:middle line:10%
to be more comfortable
in this world.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.080 align:middle line:10%
That you have a lot of
difficulties for everything,

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:10%
but with Rumi, you
feel more safe.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:90%
You love it.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You see the world in the
other ways, with love,

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:90%
and it opens your eyes.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Ready?

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:01.430 align:middle line:90%

00:40:29.235 --> 00:40:34.150 align:middle line:90%
You have said what you are.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.486 align:middle line:90%
I am what I am.

00:40:35.486 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Your actions in my head, my head
here in my hands with something

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.024 align:middle line:90%
circling inside.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I have no name for what
circles so perfectly."

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I heard a Sufi say once-- he
asked me what religion I was,

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and I just threw up my hands.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, I don't know.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.630 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's good.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:28.480 align:middle line:84%
The universe is--
love is the religion,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and the universe is the book.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.124 align:middle line:84%
So just read it,
your experience.

00:41:33.124 --> 00:41:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The signs of God
are in the world,

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and the world is in your heart.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:90%
But I love books.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>The manuscript of nature.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Inayat Khan talks about the
sacred manuscript of nature

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.724 align:middle line:90%
is the only scripture.

00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are just
hooked on books, you know?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:04.563 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:10.425 align:middle line:84%
"Spring, and everything
outside is growing.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Even the tall cypress tree.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.360 align:middle line:90%
We must not leave this place.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.802 align:middle line:84%
Around the lip of the cup
we share, these words.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.832 align:middle line:90%
My life is not mine.

00:42:37.832 --> 00:42:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:47.698 align:middle line:84%
If someone were to
play music--" OK, OK.

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>I couldn't hear my bayan
in there for some reason very

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:51.110 align:middle line:90%
much--

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>I'll tell you a little story
about my granddaughter, Briony.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Here she is.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.675 align:middle line:90%
This is the beloved.

00:43:00.675 --> 00:43:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We have an organization
that we belong to,

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Briony and I. It's called Club.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And we meet every Monday
night after dinner,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and we do science experiments,
and we draw pictures.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we were going up
to her room in the new house

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to move in to soon,

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing in that
room but just an office desk.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Some students had been
renting out the house,

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.079 align:middle line:84%
and there's just this
metal office desk.

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And we were going
to sit on the floor

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:84%
there and draw
pictures for Club.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And she reached into
the desk and pulled off

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
a bit of adding machine
tape and ripped it off,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and she said,
Granddaddy, this is

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.260 align:middle line:90%
your permanent ticket to club.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, I never had a
permanent ticket before.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:90%
So I put it in my pocket.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:10%
And while we were
drawing pictures,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.600 align:middle line:10%
I pulled it out
and noticed that it

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.640 align:middle line:10%
had this very careful
calligraphy on it.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
adding machine roll,

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.830 align:middle line:84%
some student had copied out
the entire book, every poem

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in "Birdsong," these little
poems on the adding machine

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.380 align:middle line:90%
roll.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And she had ripped that off,
the first three and 1/2 poems,

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.678 align:middle line:84%
and given it to me as my
permanent ticket to Club.

00:44:28.678 --> 00:44:47.944 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.944 --> 00:44:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>There's this old
Celtic thing that there's

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
very little difference
between a song and a poem,

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:59.120 align:middle line:84%
between a poem and a story,
between a story and a prayer.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:10%
So that any time someone
is singing a song

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.810 align:middle line:10%
or telling a story or telling
or reading poetry to a child,

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:10.360 align:middle line:10%
they're also inviting
the child into a prayer.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's never
a need to take that

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.600 align:middle line:84%
down to the level
of the child at all,

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.870 align:middle line:84%
because something in the
child already knows all this

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:90%
and is waiting to hear it again.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So that parents or teachers that
give great poetry or stories

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to children are feeding this
old soul that's in the child

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and are reassuring
the child that they've

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.610 align:middle line:90%
come to the right world.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
That, yes, it may be
confusing, and the world

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.560 align:middle line:84%
may be increasingly chaotic,
but this is the world

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:90%
where those words are said.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>I think if we
bring back poetry

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:50.870 align:middle line:84%
into the lives of children,
we will transform the world.

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:53.160 align:middle line:10%
We look for all
kinds of solutions

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.970 align:middle line:10%
for our everyday problems.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:01.602 align:middle line:10%
Most of the solutions
are purely materialistic.

00:46:01.602 --> 00:46:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
want to take care

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:84%
of the elderly, better
old folks' homes

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:90%
with more money in them.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.020 align:middle line:84%
If you want to take
care of inner cities,

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:84%
pour in the funds over
there, and it'll solve.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
crisis of our age.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And even if we do see
poverty over there,

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that's the expression of
a deeper impoverishment,

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and that impoverishment is the
soul and the spirit screaming

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:90%
for nourishment.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And that nourishment
can come from poetry.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Poetry, as TS Eliot said, is
a raid on the inarticulate.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.680 align:middle line:10%
>>On the level of 1
to 10, it's about a 2

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:49.760 align:middle line:10%
to read great works on
the spirit from the page.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.150 align:middle line:84%
On a level of 1 to
10, it's like a 9

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to hear a human being speak
it, especially one you love.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
That brings the spirit inside
the house, inside the family,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:90%
inside your genetic line.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Mmm, it's gorgeous.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So I would rather have
someone read to my children

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.670 align:middle line:84%
three poems than for them
to read 30 on the page.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>To read a poem
privately is a beautiful--

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.040 align:middle line:84%
can be a devotional,
prayerful thing.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But to have the poem
fall on the drum

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:90%
of the ear, that's different.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Etheridge Knight, the great
African-American poet,

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.785 align:middle line:84%
used to say, the
words from my mouth

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:37.330 align:middle line:84%
are beating on the
drum in your ear.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:90%
So don't think this is casual.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know why he should
come back and be so prevalent

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.830 align:middle line:90%
700 years from his lifetime.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.080 align:middle line:90%
It may be a simple thing.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.530 align:middle line:10%
It may be it's because he's
telling a truth that we

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:10%
are ready to hear.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And he tells it so clearly
and with such gentleness

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and with such elegant
images that we

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.920 align:middle line:90%
delight to hear his stories.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.215 align:middle line:84%
>>When something is true, it
can live 700 years or more.

00:48:25.215 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:10%
We read Homer or we read
people who are older than Rumi,

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:37.940 align:middle line:10%
and their beauty is just as
new today as it was then.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>We're hard to understand
for ordinary people.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:49.620 align:middle line:10%
But they can feel the smell, the
fragrance, or feel the touch.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Another saying that's a
connection with the soul.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Even 700 years later, they
can touch the human hearts.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.280 align:middle line:90%
And they do, and they will.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Rumi is like bread.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
caviar that you can

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:16.590 align:middle line:84%
have it once a while
or never in your life.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But Rumi, like a bread,
you will have it once,

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:25.880 align:middle line:84%
twice, three times, four
times, five times, all day, OK?

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:10%
And then for that, you pass
really every day with Rumi,

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.140 align:middle line:10%
not once a day.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.890 align:middle line:90%
I pass now as well.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I pass maybe two hours, three
hours, like this with Rumi,

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and I feel in paradise.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:90%
I fly with Rumi.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.610 align:middle line:90%
I go to the sky.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.195 align:middle line:84%
I will forget that
I'm on the earth.

00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:53.000 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>He said, I go into
the Christian church,

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and I go into the
Muslim mosque, and I

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
go into the Jewish synagogue,
and I see one altar.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:10.540 align:middle line:84%
He saw a single
impulse to worship

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.960 align:middle line:90%
at the core of all religions.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
When he died, members
of every faith in Konya

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:22.950 align:middle line:84%
came to his funeral
honoring him,

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:28.040 align:middle line:84%
as they felt a way of
deepening into their own faith.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>That is the reason
everyone was there.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe every nation, they
love their own prophets.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Every order, they
like their own sheiks.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But everyone loved
Mawlawi Jalal ad-Din Rumi.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>He says, "I'm not Christian,
not Jew, not Muslim, not Hindu,

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.355 align:middle line:90%
not Buddhist."

00:50:55.355 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, "I belong
to the beloved.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I have seen the
two worlds as one,

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and that one call to and know
first, last, outer, inner, only

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that breath-breathing
human being."

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.508 align:middle line:84%
"This we have now
is not imagination.

00:51:48.508 --> 00:51:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:59.200 align:middle line:84%
This is not grief or
joy, not a judging state

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.640 align:middle line:90%
or an elation or a sadness.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.975 align:middle line:90%
Those come and go.

00:52:05.975 --> 00:52:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the presence
that doesn't.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's dawn, Husam, here
in the splendor of coral,

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:33.723 align:middle line:84%
inside the friend, in the simple
truth of what Hallaj said.

00:52:33.723 --> 00:52:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:84%
What else could
human beings want?

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.050 align:middle line:90%


00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:46.251 align:middle line:84%
When grapes turn to wine,
they're wanting this.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:55.460 align:middle line:84%
When the night sky pours by,
it's really a crowd of beggars,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.073 align:middle line:90%
and they all want some of this.

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:59.623 align:middle line:90%


00:52:59.623 --> 00:53:10.640 align:middle line:84%
This that we are now created
the body cell by cell,

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.270 align:middle line:90%
like bees building a honeycomb.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The universe and the human
body grew from this, not this

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.729 align:middle line:84%
from the universe
and the human body.

00:53:22.729 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:31.195 align:middle line:84%
This that we have now
is not imagination.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:42.620 align:middle line:84%
This is not grief or

or an elation or a sadness.

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Those come and go.

This is the presence

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.310 align:middle line:90%
It's dawn, Husam.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:10.154 align:middle line:84%
