00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:10%
>>I first saw "A
Course in Miracles"

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:10%
on someone's coffee
table in I suppose

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:10%
1977, something like that.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:90%
And I read the introduction.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And the introduction is a
kind of astonishing thing.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I have it here.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The introduction says, "This
is a course in miracles.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
It is a required course.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Only the time you
take it is voluntary.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Free will does not mean that you
can establish the curriculum.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It means only that
you can elect what

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
you want to take
at a given time.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
The course does not aim at
teaching the meaning of love,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
for that is beyond
what can be taught.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It does aim, however,
at removing the blocks

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to the awareness of
love's presence, which

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:90%
is your natural inheritance.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of love
is fear, but what

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
is all-encompassing
can have no opposite.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
This course can therefore
be summed up very

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
simply in this way.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Nothing real can be threatened.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Nothing unreal exists.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Herein lies the peace of God."

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I saw that, I read
it, and I thought

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that was the most
amazing piece of writing.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.306 align:middle line:84%
To pick up a book and
have the book tell you

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.335 align:middle line:90%
it's a required course.

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:02.213 align:middle line:90%
You go, who was it?

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Who is telling me that this
book is a required course?

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%
I was so intrigued by that.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>I read one page.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And that one page of reading,
and I heard for the first time,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
a little inner voice had
said, physician, heal thyself.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.319 align:middle line:10%
This is your way home.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:10%
And I had the most
amazing experience

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.204 align:middle line:10%
of feeling a sense of
oneness with the whole world,

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:10%
that there was
absolutely no separation,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:10%
that there was only love.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:10%
And a real feeling that I
was to be of service to God.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.853 align:middle line:84%
My whole life would
be changed, and it

00:02:27.853 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
would be a life of giving and
a life of being of service.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.726 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand
that, but it

00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
was a very deep,
penetrating feeling.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I became a student of the
course, fought it all the way.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't deal with the thickness
of the course, let alone

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.605 align:middle line:90%
its Christian terminology.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:43.355 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's something
about the course

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
that just compelled me to go on.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>The spiritual genesis of
the international bestseller

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
"A Course in Miracles" is both
extraordinary and inspiring.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
The self study three book course
was dictated by an inner voice,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and it has profoundly changed
the lives of countless people

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
the world over.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Spread mainly by word
of mouth, its principles

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
have thus far been known
only to its students.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
But now its
transformational teachings

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
of love, forgiveness,
inner peace and wisdom

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.392 align:middle line:90%
will be explored.

00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Communicating the correct
meaning of the course

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.055 align:middle line:84%
rests largely with Dr.
Kenneth Wapnick, president

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Foundation for
"A Course in Miracles."

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:10%
In a recent
television interview,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:10%
he gave an enlightening
overview of the course.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:10%
>>It's a form of
spiritual psychotherapy

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:10%
that comes to us in
a Christian context.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:10%
As you mentioned at the
beginning, its author is Jesus.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's a Christianity
that has practically nothing

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to do with the traditional
teachings of 2,000 years.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
It certainly has nothing to do
with the Jesus of the Bible.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Its principal message
is forgiveness,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and that the way that we
remember our identity as God's

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
children and realize that
in his eyes we are all one

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:90%
is to forgive each other.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It basically is a self-study
course in the sense

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.809 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need
anyone outside.

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
The teacher, or the
guru, as it were,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.125 align:middle line:84%
would be Jesus or
the Holy Spirit,

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:90%
who guides us day by day.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.522 align:middle line:84%
Our lives in this world are
seen as a classroom basically,

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
in which we learn
the Holy Spirit's

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:90%
lessons of forgiveness.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, as I
mentioned, it's by undoing

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.865 align:middle line:84%
all of the feelings
of inadequacy,

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
our feelings of
guilt, our anxieties,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.884 align:middle line:84%
which is what
forgiveness brings about,

00:04:28.884 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that the love of God, which
is present in all of us,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:90%
is allowed to be remembered.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:10%
>>There is a massive effort
going on in this society,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:10%
and I think
throughout the world,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:10%
to retrieve some lost
part of ourselves.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And "A Course in Miracles"
is part of that effort.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>"A Course in Miracles"
contains a whole philosophy

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:90%
for living in our times.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The "Course" was born when an
inner voice spoke to Dr. Helen

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Schucman in 1965 while she was
working at Columbia University.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Helen was a highly respected
research psychologist

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and associate professor
who worked with Dr. William

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Thetford, a professor
of medical psychology

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
at the prestigious
Columbia University's

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
College of Physicians
and Surgeons.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:10%
In her unpublished
autobiography,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Helen, who died on
February 9, 1981,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:10%
described her reactions to her
job and the highly stressful

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:10%
situations that existed there.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I was a
psychologist, educated,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
conservative in theory
and atheistic in belief.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I was working in a prestigious
and highly academic setting,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and the job was
ghastly at first.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The hospital didn't provide
space for our projects,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and when we were finally housed
in the new research building,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it was the most
difficult situation

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:90%
of my professional life.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The work was oppressive
and carried out

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
in an atmosphere of suspicion
and competitiveness,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and interpersonal harmony
was depressingly lacking.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Then something
happened that triggered

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
a chain of events I could
never have predicted.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:10%
>>We had worked together
for a number of years

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:10%
actually, from 1958
until the summer of 1965,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:10%
with a good deal of
improvement in terms

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:10%
of the organization
of the psychology

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:10%
department at the hospital.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:90%
But we weren't really at peace.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I gave
Helen a little speech.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
This was in June of 1965 before
we were going to a meeting.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, what
I said is, there

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
must be a better way of living
and working in the world,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of handling our personal and
professional relationships

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and problems, and I'm
determined to find it.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:84%
This was kind of a
long speech for me,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and I remember feeling
at the end of this

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that Helen probably
was going to laugh.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But to my amazement,
quite the contrary.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're
absolutely right, Bill.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll find this
other way together.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of a joint commitment,

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:90%
which the two of us made.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
The summer of 1965 was
an extraordinary summer

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
for both Helen and me
in a number of ways.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Helen began to have
a great deal of what

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
you might call heightened visual
imagery, or dream sequences.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
She began to experience this
with considerable clarity.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And I suggested that she
write down these experiences

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
as they occurred because
they seem to have something--

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
they were saying
something very important,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:84%
even though we didn't know
exactly what that was.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.126 align:middle line:84%
One of those sequences
involved being in a boat.

00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>The boat was moving
slowly but easily

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
along a very straight
little canal.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
There was just enough breeze
to help the boat along.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if there is
buried treasure here,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I thought to myself dreamily.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.422 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be
surprised if there were.

00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Then I noticed a long
pole with a large hook

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
on the end lying on
the bottom of the boat.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Just the thing, I
thought, dropping the hook

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
into the water and reaching the
pole down as far as I could.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
The hook caught something
heavy, and I raised it

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:90%
with difficulty.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It was an ancient
treasure chest,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
the wood worn from the
water, and the bottom

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.515 align:middle line:90%
covered with seaweed.

00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing in the
chest but a large black book,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
like the spring binders used for
holding manuscripts or papers

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.780 align:middle line:84%
On the spine, one word
was written in gold.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:90%
The word was Aesculapius.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The word was familiar,
but I could not

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:90%
remember what it meant.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
When I looked it
up, I found that it

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:84%
was the name of the
Greek god of healing.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw the same book once
more a few nights later.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:84%
This time, there was a
string of pearls around it.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
This psychic phase
ended abruptly

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:84%
with a particularly
clear picture episode

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in which I knew I had made
an irrevocable choice.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself entering a cave
cut into a rock formation

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.265 align:middle line:90%
on a bleak, windswept sea coast.

00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
What I found in the cave
was a large and very old

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:90%
parchment scroll.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Its ends were attached to
heavy gold-tipped poles,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and the scroll was
wrapped around them

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
so that they met in the
middle of the scroll

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.265 align:middle line:90%
and were tied tightly together.

00:11:13.265 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I managed to untie the ends
and open the scroll just enough

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the center panel, on
which two words were written,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:90%
God is.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Then I unrolled the scroll
all the way, and as I did so,

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
tiny letters began to appear
on both sides of the panel.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
The silent voice which
I had heard before

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
explained the situation
mentally to me.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the left side, you

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:84%
will be able to read the
past, said the voice.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
right side, you

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:90%
will be able to read the future.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But I hesitated only a
moment before rolling up

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the scroll sufficiently
to conceal everything

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:90%
except the center panel.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I am not interested in reading
the past or the future,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I said with finality.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.878 align:middle line:90%
I will just stop with this.

00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The voice sounded both
reassured and reassuring.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:90%
You made it that time, it said.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.645 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And that, it seemed, was that.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:10%
>>Helen prided herself as a
research psychologist, not as

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:10%
someone who heard voices,
who had heightened

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:10%
visual imagery,
who experienced all

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.460 align:middle line:10%
of these psychic
events that occurred

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:10%
throughout the summer of '65.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:10%
It was extremely
distressing to her.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
She kept feeling that maybe
she was losing her mind.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Certainly she couldn't
reconcile all of this activity

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:84%
with her scientific
predilections.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And this became a particularly
acute problem for her

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
as the summer and
early fall began.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
One night she called me, and
this was in October, and said,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
you know that inner
voice refuses to go away.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It keeps saying, this
is a course in miracles.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Please take notes.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:90%
What shall I do?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Suppose it's crazy.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Suppose it doesn't
make any sense.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Suppose it's flipped.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was obviously
going through a great deal

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
of anguish and
agony at that point.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:90%
I said the only obvious thing.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you take
down whatever it is?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
You can read it to me tomorrow
morning in the office,

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and if it doesn't
make any sense,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
no one else ever has
to know about it.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But at least we'll
know what it is.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we did.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:90%
The next morning, Helen came in.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And as she read that
beautiful introduction

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to the text, which says
nothing real can be threatened.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing unreal exists.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Herein lies the peace of God.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious that we
were tuning into something

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that could hardly be
regarded as crazy, no matter

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:90%
how unexpected it was.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>A major contribution
of miracles

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
is their strength
in releasing you

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:84%
from your false sense of
isolation, deprivation,

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.571 align:middle line:90%
and lack.

00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%
A miracle is never lost.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It may touch many people
you have not even met

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and produce undreamed
of changes in situations

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:90%
of which you are not even aware.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Miracles are natural
signs of forgiveness.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Through miracles, you
accept God's forgiveness

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:90%
by extending it to others.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I would feel the writing coming
on almost daily, and sometimes

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:90%
several times a day.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Evenings turned out to be a
favorite time for dictation.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I objected bitterly to
this, and often went to bed

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
defiantly without
writing anything.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
But I could not sleep.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I got up in some
disgust and wrote as directed.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I never knew when I started
a sentence how it would end,

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas came
so quickly that I

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
had trouble keeping
up with them.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Helen could turn it
on or off at any time.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:10%
She could stop in the
middle of a sentence

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:10%
without even going back to
reread what she had written

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:10%
and continue when
she had a moment.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
She could have a research
conference in mid-sentence.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:90%
It made no difference at all.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The flow of the
material continued

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
without any altered state.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Helen at no time was
in a trance or anything

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:90%
remotely resembling a trance.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.076 align:middle line:84%
But as I read the material, I
recognized that Helen in no way

00:16:20.076 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
could have written
this material.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It was totally alien to her
background, to her interests,

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and her mode of
conceptualizing abstract ideas,

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.591 align:middle line:84%
that there's no way
she could've done this.

00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Where did the
writing come from?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I did not understand the
calm but impressive authority

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:90%
with which the voice dictated.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It is largely because of the
strangely compelling nature

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
of this authority that I
have referred to the voice

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
with a capital V. At several
points in the writing,

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the voice itself speaks
in no uncertain terms

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:90%
about the author, Jesus.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
My own reactions to
these references,

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
which literally
stunned me at the time,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
have decreased in
intensity and are now

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.439 align:middle line:84%
at a level of wonder
and acceptance.

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
The name of Jesus Christ
as such is but a symbol,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
but it stands for love
that is not of this world.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:28.622 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.622 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
This course comes from
him because his words

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.705 align:middle line:84%
have reached you in a language
you can love and understand.

00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The name of Jesus is the
name of one who was a man,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
but saw the face of
Christ in all his brothers

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.765 align:middle line:90%
and remembered God.

00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Is He the Christ?

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, along with you.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>The first part of the
material that we worked on

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:84%
lasted for almost three
years and ended up

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:90%
as a 622-page volume.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
When the text was finished,
Helen felt, as I did,

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that that was the completion
of our assignment,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and that we had plenty
to do to simply try

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to learn those concepts and
apply them in our lives.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
However, after a period
of perhaps nine months,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Helen got increasingly restless.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, she
began to take down

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
the "Workbook for Students,"
which consists of 365 lessons,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:90%
one for each day of the year.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning of
the second part of the course.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That took approximately
2 and 1/2 years,

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of that, we again
thought that we were finished.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And after a number
of months, again,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of not being quite sure
what would happen next,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the third and final
volume was announced

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:90%
as the "Manual for Teachers."

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So the total period of time
was approximately seven years

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
from the time we began with the
text, including the workbook,

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and finally the
manual for teachers.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:10%
>>I first met Helen and
Bill in the fall of '72,

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:10%
and then I saw the "Course" for
the first time in May of '73.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:10%
Then after, we spent a
great deal of time together.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think what impressed
me first about Helen and Bill

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.947 align:middle line:84%
was despite all the
conflict that they

00:19:47.947 --> 00:19:50.280 align:middle line:84%
had with each other and the
difficulties with the course

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
or resistances to the
course, that there's

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.566 align:middle line:84%
underlying commitment that they
both had made, to see to it

00:19:57.566 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that the purity of the
course and its message

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
would never be changed, and
would always remain pure.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that always
was extremely impressive to me.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.636 align:middle line:84%
Helen and I spent a great
deal of time together.

00:20:08.636 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We had dinner almost every
night, she, her husband Louie,

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and myself.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And we spent a great deal of
time going over the manuscript,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
making sure that its
published form would

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:84%
be exactly the way
Jesus wanted it.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And Helen herself was
an extraordinary woman.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
She would go from moments of
real kind of other worldliness,

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
where her whole
face would change.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And she would tell me afterwards
that in those moments,

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
she was like beyond even
Jesus, beyond the relationship

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.795 align:middle line:84%
with Him, beyond
hearing His voice.

00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It was like being
in the presence

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
almost of an ageless,
timeless wisdom.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.889 align:middle line:84%
And then within seconds,
she'd go right back down,

00:20:47.889 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
worrying about where
her husband was,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
how come he was
late for supper, and

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
concerned about
all mundane things.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:10%
>>I was teaching at New
York University in 1975

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:10%
and feeling full up
with an exciting career

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:10%
in what we then called
experimental parapsychology,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:10%
or consciousness
research, meeting

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:10%
very interesting people,
traveling, speaking.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling a
sort of emptiness.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know why.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
One night I locked myself
in the bathroom in my home,

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and I went to pieces.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I could say it was
a form of surrender.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I called out from the
bottom of my heart,

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
won't someone up
there please help me?

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:90%
And I meant it.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Within a very short
time, I received the help

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I sought, but not in
the form I anticipated.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
A few days after, I was
asked by a good friend

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to accompany him to
meet two professors

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of medical psychology
at Columbia University

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
School of Physicians
and Surgeons.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I went with him, not
knowing what to expect

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.630 align:middle line:90%
or why the meeting.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed as if
I was supposed to go.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of mood
continued as Bill took us

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
inside the university,
where we had lunch with Bill

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and his associate,
Helen Schucman.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I found her to be a very
clever woman, very intellectual

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and well spoken, quite
articulate, and a bit sharp.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was intimidated.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation was going
in all different directions.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit bemused, I
found myself turning to Helen

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and saying to her, you're
hearing an inner voice,

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
know what I meant.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:90%
But she seemed quite startled.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I beg your pardon.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And Bill tried to
soothe the situation.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, Helen, let's
go back to our office,

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
this in private.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And the two of them took
me back to their office

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
and closed the door.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And she handed me the text
with its introduction.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I took it from her,
and I put it on my lap,

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.730 align:middle line:84%
as the others were
talking among themselves.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And I looked down at it.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I opened up the black binder.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to
the introduction,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and I read, "This is
a course in miracles.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a required course."

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
question in my mind

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that I was being
given a miracle,

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:90%
and that I'd asked for it.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>In New York,
Judith Skutch-Whitson

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
spent a great deal of
time with Helen Schucman,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and she quickly recognized
the profound importance

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:90%
of the course.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
This became a turning
point in Judith's life,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and she soon helped establish
the nonprofit Foundation

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
for Inner Peace and found a
way to publish the course.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Tolerance for
pain may be high,

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:90%
but it is not without limit.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, everyone begins
to recognize, however dimly,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:90%
that there must be a better way.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
As this recognition becomes
more firmly established,

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a turning point.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
This ultimately reawakens
spiritual vision.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>>I can't even imagine
what my life would

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:10%
have been if I had not found
"A Course in Miracles."

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:84%
When I first picked
it up at my apartment,

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I started reading
it voraciously.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Then it was really time for me.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And I felt, as so
many people have said,

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:90%
that I had come home.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't have that
"A Course in Miracles"

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
gave me is a deep
sense that faith in God

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is inseparable from
faith in other people.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
means to me in my life.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a continuous
reminder that my temptation

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to find guilt in my brother
is an attack on myself.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
That was what so moved
me the first day I ever

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
read a page of the
"Course in Miracles,"

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's the message
that most moves me today.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Trials are but lessons
that you failed to learn,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:90%
presented once again.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So where you made a
faulty choice before,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:84%
you now can make a
better one, and thus

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:84%
escape all pain
that what you chose

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:90%
before has brought to you.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
In every difficulty, all
distress and each perplexity,

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Christ calls to you and gently
says, my brother, choose again.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>As an actor, I've played
many roles in my career.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:10%
But in my life, I've only
played one, which is the victim.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm always victimized
by something or someone.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to look for a
way out and an explanation

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:90%
to all this.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I picked up about every
possible path and technique

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual supermarket,
and nothing worked.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So six years ago, the "Course"
was translated into Spanish,

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and I picked it up and
started a little bit.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there
was something there.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The "Course" would teach me that
victimization feelings are not

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
a fact, but an interpretation
you are putting to them.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But what is more important,
it would teach me

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
how the presence of love
within me I can call for help.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Which I did, and
nowadays I experience

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
a very strong presence
of love next to me.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I feel victimized
by something or someone,

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I can call for help.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And He teaches me it's
not an attack, but just

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
the silly things we do to
each other when we are afraid.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:90%
We are all afraid.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And that has changed my
life because now, I'm

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:84%
not desperate or
alone anymore, and I

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
feel a deep sense of peace that
nothing ever gave me before.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>All my life, I've
always felt a sense

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
of emptiness and alienation.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I never really understood
it because I've always

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
been somewhat successful
in terms of the world.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to fill up
this sense of emptiness

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
through causes, through civil
rights, and the peace movement.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Africa in the
Peace Corps for two years.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a Ph.D., and I
traveled all over the world.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
these experiences

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.320 align:middle line:84%
actually was a disappointment
because it just

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
didn't do what I thought
it would do for me.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
About nine years ago, I was
working with people with AIDS,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and I loved the work.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It was very challenging
and intense.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But one day I began to realize
that I couldn't continue

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
giving hope to my clients
because I felt hopeless myself.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, there
must be a better way.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Soon after that, I found
the "Course in Miracles,"

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't at all what
I thought it would be.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But it really
taught me that I do

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
have an inner teacher
inside me, and I

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
don't have to go to things
outside to fill that need

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and that emptiness.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to use
people to meet my needs.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I've also seen
that relationships

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
with people in my
family and my friends

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and my whole purpose toward
work, which as a university

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
professor has changed
because all of these

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.359 align:middle line:84%
are used as a classroom to
get closer to the love of God.

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that the most important
thing the "Course" has taught

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
me is that I no longer have
a sense of hopelessness.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:10%
>>I see, in my own life,
a tremendous growth,

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:10%
especially over
the last few years

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:10%
since I've been studying
"A Course in Miracles."

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:10%
That I've come to
a point that I am

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:10%
at least able to see the
baggage I'm dragging behind me,

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:10%
and realizing that it's
my choice to release that.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And that in releasing
those illusions-- and they

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.470 align:middle line:84%
are illusions, because
the past is over.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
It can touch us not.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And the future is not-- nothing
exists but the present now,

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:90%
this wholly instant now.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And once one gets that, there's
just a tremendous power.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Because you are defenseless.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:84%
There is no need to feel
vulnerable to the world

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480 align:middle line:90%
that you're joined with.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
healing process,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and I think when we
mirror that to each other,

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:90%
it's nonstoppable.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Part of my work as a
clinician in this county

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
was consulting with
oncologists with children

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.745 align:middle line:84%
who had very serious
illness and were dying.

00:29:31.745 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:10%
And I noted that many
of these children

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes asked the
doctor or nurse--

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:10%
this is way back now in
1975-- about their thoughts

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.185 align:middle line:10%
about dying, and their
fears about dying.

00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes the
nurse and the doctor

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.500 align:middle line:90%
would just change the subject.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred
to me, there need

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
to be a place where
kids can really

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.582 align:middle line:84%
talk and have an
honest reaction.

00:29:48.582 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes,
those same kids

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
would find the person
who is the most

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:84%
honest was the woman who
was scrubbing the floor.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And she'd give an
honest response.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I gave a lecture
back in New York

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:84%
on the prevention of
cancer and talking

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
about some of the things I was
doing on a one-to-one basis,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.635 align:middle line:84%
maybe utilizing
"Course" principles.

00:30:06.635 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And what occurred
to me was I was

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.702 align:middle line:84%
to start-- it was
in my meditation

00:30:09.702 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
on the plane coming
back-- I was to start

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.005 align:middle line:84%
a center that would make use
of the "Course" principles

00:30:14.005 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and allow me to look
at death differently.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.636 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
children would teach me

00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:90%
these spiritual principles.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.982 align:middle line:84%
And I was just to be the
catalyst for setting it up.

00:30:21.982 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I set it up really based
on the course principle.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Not saying to children,
look, I have a better way

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:27.834 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with this
than someone else,

00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:90%
but I'd like your help.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Can we be colleagues
with each other

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:84%
about a different way
of looking at the world?

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.234 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it would be
possible, if you got together

00:30:37.234 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:84%
with other children
and could talk

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
with them about
their problems, you

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
could end up helping
each other far better

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.510 align:middle line:84%
than doctors and
nurses and teachers.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:90%
And so we started in that way.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The name Center for
Attitudinal Healing

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:84%
actually makes use of
many of the principles

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.200 align:middle line:90%
of the "Course of Miracles."

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Because what is
attitudinal healing,

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
except letting go of the
negative thoughts of fear

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and anger and attack
thoughts, and having them

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:84%
being replaced with love
that's always been there.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.203 align:middle line:84%
So this is what, really,
attitudinal healing's all

00:31:02.203 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I began going around talking
about love and God, some things

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.350 align:middle line:84%
that we don't talk
about in medical school.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But the majority
of doctors, they

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:84%
became very skeptical, very
concerned, very wondrous.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was that the
families that we were seeing,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:84%
children who had catastrophic
illness, that there

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
was such rapid shifts
in their feelings.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:10%
Their whole family structure
had changed so rapidly

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:10%
that these very physicians
that were very skeptical

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:10%
began to refer people to us.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
has been helpful for me

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.688 align:middle line:90%
is a quote from the "Course."

00:31:32.688 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:90%
It says, "I'm not a body.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm free, for I am
still as God created me.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The peace of God is
everything that I want.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The peace of God is
my one goal, the aim

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of all my living
here, the end I seek.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:84%
My purpose, my
function, and my life,

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
while I abide where
I'm not at home."

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And children at the Center have
really been greatly helpful

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
to me at taking another
look at the body

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the difference
between life and death.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.626 align:middle line:84%
One child, who had sickle
cell anemia, named Kerry,

00:31:58.626 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I was asking him about what
he thought about death.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
He'd come close to
death many times.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
Jerry, I think what

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.746 align:middle line:84%
happens when you die is that God
has really created a library,

00:32:08.746 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're a book
in His library.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And what He does is he loans
this book to your parents,

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's on a loan basis.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.585 align:middle line:84%
And when the due
date is up, that book

00:32:16.585 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:90%
comes back into God's heart.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.816 align:middle line:84%
So you're never really
separate from God,

00:32:19.816 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and when your
time's up, you just

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:90%
go home to the heart of God.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, what a
beautiful way of looking at it.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>I came to UC
Berkley around 1967

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.470 align:middle line:84%
in its very turbulent
years at the school,

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of racial strife.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And around 1968, '69,
I took a lot of courses

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in sociology, psychology,
political science.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And every-- the theme in all
of them was blacks were poor.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Blacks were deprived.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Blacks were the
wretched of society.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I began to look at
life, the society,

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:90%
with anger and frustration.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.184 align:middle line:84%
And around that same
time, there was a group

00:32:59.184 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of people who called
themselves the Nation of Islam.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
taught black supremacy.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And I lived this doctrine.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:90%
I ate it.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I slept it.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really socialize
with whites for seven years.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So I went over to JFK, and I was
like, this is the very first--

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been on a campus
or in a white environment

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.002 align:middle line:90%
for seven years.

00:33:22.002 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a lady there
named Judy Skutch,

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and she was introducing
a set of books

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:90%
titled "A Course in Miracles."

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And when Judy read
this introduction,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I had this experience
that I hadn't

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
experienced since I was a child.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I was one with
everything in the room.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.605 align:middle line:90%
I felt totally at peace.

00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And something deep inside of
me said, this a tool for you.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>>When I first read in
"A Course in Miracles,"

00:33:54.740 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:10%
the ideas that our home
is in God's presence,

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:10%
that we are spirit
and not the body,

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:10%
that we have been created as one
with each other and our source,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.774 align:middle line:10%
I just knew it was true.

00:34:12.774 --> 00:34:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I'd had the experience.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:19.219 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need validation of the
experience to know it was true.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:23.239 align:middle line:84%
But I did need an intellectual
system to help me apply it.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.949 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I first
noticed about the course,

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:29.120 align:middle line:84%
that I could start
with a lesson a day

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to start to unlearn
the mistakes that

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
had been programmed
into my mind.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:84%
That I could remember
more clearly that indeed

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:90%
I am spirit.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, I'm
at home and totally safe.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to go any
place to find safety.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
anyone different.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I just have to
remember who I am.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:90%
>>That's an outside change.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:90%
What's inside began to change.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I began to see the
love that was there

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:90%
between-- from human to human.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I began to experience that.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I began to get new friends who
were not-- that didn't just

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:10.070 align:middle line:84%
look like me, who were
white, who were Hispanic.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Color became-- was not an
issue in my relationships.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I began to see that all
men are created equal.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And unless we see that, we're
not going to experience peace.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I began to see that--
anytime I see myself

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:84%
as being above
another human being

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.710 align:middle line:84%
or below another
human being, I'm

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.590 align:middle line:90%
not going to experience peace.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Two of my favorite quotes
from the course are two lessons.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.580 align:middle line:10%
Number 134, which is if I
defend myself, I'm attacked,

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.770 align:middle line:10%
and the other is 185 or
285, which is my mind

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.980 align:middle line:10%
can change all
thoughts that hurt.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.260 align:middle line:10%
These I have found a
tremendous practical value

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:10%
in going through life.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And I've also found that, in
dealing with other people,

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:10%
and especially when we go
into the prisons and deal

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.410 align:middle line:10%
with people who are in prison,
that these two lessons are

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:10%
very pragmatic, very
practical, and are

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:10%
of tremendous value
to those people who

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:10%
have found themselves
in that situation.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:10%
>>The "Course" started letting
me get peace, letting me relax.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And I started experimenting
with the lessons

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:10%
that I was picking up and
trying them out on people.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:10%
And I started getting
real warmth and closeness

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.010 align:middle line:10%
and in touch with people.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:90%
When they hurt, I hurt.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Not out of sympathy,
but out of empathy.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I could understand more
clearly, having experienced

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:84%
the pain and the degradations
and the things that

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:90%
go on in prison.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And not pointing fingers
that that's their fault.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:90%
They did that to me.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Society did that to me.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.769 align:middle line:90%
The jury did that to me.

00:36:58.769 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:90%
The judge did that to me.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I was real clear now
that I did that to me.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.026 align:middle line:84%
I allowed myself to
become unconnected.

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I allowed myself to be unloving
and unavailable and resentful

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:90%
and bitter and things like that.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And once I got that, then
it was real clear that it

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:24.540 align:middle line:84%
was OK to tell somebody that,
you know what, I love you.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And be in prison
at the same time.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>>What the "Course"
does for a lot of people

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:10%
is to get them to
know, recognize,

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.486 align:middle line:10%
almost instantly, that
they are not acting the way

00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:37.360 align:middle line:10%
they want to, and they
can change their minds

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.651 align:middle line:10%
because they are aware of that.

00:37:38.651 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is as much
of a help as anything.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it stops you
from going in a direction

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that you inherently
really don't want to do.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be conflicted.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to be conflicted.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.370 align:middle line:84%
They want to be loving,
and they want to love.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It stops you from
being conflicted,

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.344 align:middle line:84%
which is what it does to
an awful lot of people

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:01.240 align:middle line:90%
who study this course.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:10%
>>A lot of the "Course"
is about living

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:10%
in the world in a different way.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:10%
Also, a lot of it's about guilt.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Two of the things,
obviously, that

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
cause the greatest degree
of guilt in all of us

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.396 align:middle line:90%
here are sex and money.

00:38:14.396 --> 00:38:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And while the "Course"
takes positions on nothing--

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:84%
the "Course" is not
a system of behavior.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.810 align:middle line:84%
The "Course" is a
system in mind changing.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Really, I think, what it has
taught me regarding those two

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:84%
subjects, is that sex and money
are neutral things in which I

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.050 align:middle line:90%
invest my meaning.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Like everything else
in the world, the body,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
the world itself, sex, money,
whatever else it would happen

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to be, each thing only has the
meaning that my mind gives it.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:84%
If I make sex a very
important thing to me,

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and make it something
that I need,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving power to sex
that sex doesn't have.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
If I make money something
very important to me,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.230 align:middle line:84%
which I did for a good
portion of my life,

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.494 align:middle line:84%
then I make money something
that it really isn't.

00:38:59.494 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think the easiest
way to say it is this.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:05.602 align:middle line:84%
The "Course in Miracles" teaches
you to live in the moment.

00:39:05.602 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
In order to live
in the moment, you

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:90%
have to do a couple of things.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You must forgive so
that you can trust.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You must have no
defense so you don't

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.549 align:middle line:84%
feel that you're
going to be attacked.

00:39:15.549 --> 00:39:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But assuming that you can
go through the sequence

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:84%
of no defenses,
forgiveness of your brother

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:84%
for what he didn't do
to you, and then trust,

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and you can live
in the moment, then

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.150 align:middle line:84%
all those things
become meaningless.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Money becomes meaningless
because living in the moment

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:90%
is the whole point.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Money is a
future-oriented thing.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Sex becomes something that
you do or you don't do.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.267 align:middle line:84%
If it's there and you
should do it, you do it.

00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:84%
If it's not there, and you
don't do it, you don't do it.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't become
something that's

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
more important
than it should be.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately for us way
back for the story of Genesis

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
on through the
world, sex has become

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.336 align:middle line:84%
something that's almost
like the serpent.

00:39:50.336 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:90%
We should hate the serpent.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.251 align:middle line:90%
We should hate sex.

00:39:52.251 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We should feel guilty
when we have sex.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:84%
We should feel guilty if
we have too much money.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.710 align:middle line:84%
We should feel guilty if
we have too little money.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.050 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of absurd.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think what the
"Course" taught me to do

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is to take one step back from
those emotion-ridden things

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that the emotion
that's in there I put in there,

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and I can subtract it out.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.057 align:middle line:84%
And then in doing so, I
can see it in balance.

00:40:14.057 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think if there's anything
that the course would teach us

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:84%
over a long period of time
is to become in balance.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.050 align:middle line:10%
>>I encountered "A
Course in Miracles"

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:10%
at a very critical
time in my life,

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:10%
when I was Chief of the Foreign
Affairs and National Defense

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.660 align:middle line:10%
Division of the
Library of Congress,

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.740 align:middle line:10%
and had 150 professional
men and women

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.820 align:middle line:10%
working for me and
for the Congress

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.190 align:middle line:10%
to clarify major issues
of defense policy

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.340 align:middle line:10%
and foreign policy.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very rich and full
life, a very useful career,

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:84%
you might say, as far
as informing congress

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.270 align:middle line:84%
about different ways of looking
at foreign defense policy

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.210 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
at precisely the time

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.310 align:middle line:84%
when, from an outsider's
perception of me,

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:84%
my life seemed to
be most useful,

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:90%
it had the least meaning.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Several quotations
became my guide.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, in a
sense, the one that

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:24.940 align:middle line:84%
was most startling for me
was the quotation, do not

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.930 align:middle line:90%
seek to change the world.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Instead, change
your mind about it.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, given the fact that my
entire professional life had

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.104 align:middle line:84%
been dedicated to leaving
the world a better place,

00:41:37.104 --> 00:41:39.270 align:middle line:84%
in effect changing some of
the things that I thought

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
were wrong with the world, and
my technique for doing that

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:50.070 align:middle line:84%
was to try to understand
economics, politics, strategy,

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.940 align:middle line:84%
psychology, sociology,
the Chinese language.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a great deal
of education that

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:90%
aimed at being more useful.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Yet, as time went on,
I became very clear

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that, as they say in Washington,
where I stand on an issue

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:90%
depends on where I sit.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So when I read this first
quote in the "Course,"

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
it was something, that as
people say in California,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.110 align:middle line:90%
really resonated with me.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:90%
It sounded true.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>The journey to God is
merely the reawakening

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge of
where you are always,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.722 align:middle line:90%
and what you are forever.

00:42:31.722 --> 00:42:34.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It is a journey without
distance to a goal

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:38.990 align:middle line:90%
that has never changed.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
You dwell not here,
but in eternity.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:51.240 align:middle line:84%
You travel but in dreams
while safe at home.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.440 align:middle line:10%
>>I think it is the vision
of universal innocence

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.880 align:middle line:10%
that makes the
"Course in Miracles"

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.900 align:middle line:10%
attract so many people.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.290 align:middle line:84%
That's not an easy
spirituality, by the way.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy
spirituality at all.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It merely is a message that
until and unless we are willing

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
to see the innocence in
others and ourselves,

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:84%
we cannot experience
the peace of God.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.040 align:middle line:84%
The "Course in Miracles"
says that heaven is not

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.320 align:middle line:84%
a condition or place, but
an awareness of our oneness.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And we are one in our innocence.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the way that we err,
the ways that we make mistakes,

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Your mistakes are
different than my mistakes.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.055 align:middle line:84%
But your innocence is
the same as my innocence.

00:43:50.055 --> 00:43:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>You have but two
emotions, love and fear.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
One you made, and
one was given you.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Each is a way of seeing,
and different worlds

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.236 align:middle line:84%
arise from their
different sights.

00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:84%
See the love of God in you,
and you will see it everywhere

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:30.633 align:middle line:90%
because it is everywhere.

00:44:30.633 --> 00:44:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:39.640 align:middle line:84%
With love in you, you have
no need except to extend it.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>>The "Course" is predicated
on two belief systems.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:10%
One is real.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:10%
The other is false.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.460 align:middle line:10%
The false belief system
is one the ego adheres to.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is that we're born into
this world in physical bodies

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:84%
in a world that is real,
the physical, and things

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.610 align:middle line:84%
happen to us, and sometimes
we experience happiness, once

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:84%
in a while joy, very often
depression and anxiety,

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.460 align:middle line:84%
certainly disease,
and always death.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the system of
thought that the ego loves,

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:middle line:84%
the ego adheres
to, the ego exults,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and the ego wants
us to believe in.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.260 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there's a belief system

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that God is our reality, we
are created in God's image

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.960 align:middle line:84%
as spirit, not
the physical body,

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are love, that a
property of love is light,

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and that we are eternal.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.450 align:middle line:90%
We cannot be hurt.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:38.545 align:middle line:90%
We're inviolate.

00:45:38.545 --> 00:45:41.250 align:middle line:90%
We can't be destroyed.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:84%
When one puts it that way,
who but an insane person

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.980 align:middle line:90%
would want to choose the ego?

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things I've learned
from working with clients

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in psychotherapy
is that they tend

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to get better when they
take responsibility

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:90%
for their experience.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:10%
And the "Course" speaks
to this very directly.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:10%
It says simply, I am
responsible for what I see.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.130 align:middle line:10%
I choose the feelings
that I experience,

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.630 align:middle line:10%
and I decide upon the
goal I would achieve.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
seems to happen to me I

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.570 align:middle line:84%
ask for and receive
as I have asked.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's quite a
challenge, if we're

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.460 align:middle line:84%
going to accept
that at face value.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it gives
us a sense of direction.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It points out to us that we
need to take responsibility

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:84%
for the feelings we have
and that if I'm angry,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.200 align:middle line:90%
at some level, that's a choice.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It may be out of defensiveness.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.070 align:middle line:90%
It may be out of fear.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But that basically, I
can choose whether I

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:84%
want to release that anger, to
work it through and move on,

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.220 align:middle line:84%
or whether I want to remain
stuck in it, so to speak.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
sometimes a problem.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Because in
psychotherapy, we often

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.090 align:middle line:84%
emphasize the importance
of expressing anger,

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but we forget that
that's not an endpoint.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.980 align:middle line:84%
When a person feels
like a victim,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.020 align:middle line:84%
it's maybe very appropriate
for them to get angry about it.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's also appropriate
for them to release that

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.060 align:middle line:90%
and to move on.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So that in order to get in
touch with our creativity,

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to be truly creative rather
than reactive in our lives,

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.380 align:middle line:84%
we need to get beyond
the position of victim

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and the position of adversary
and angry reactivity

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
into a more creative view of
what's possible in our lives.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:30.450 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>You may believe that you are
responsible for what you do,

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.595 align:middle line:90%
but not for what you think.

00:47:35.595 --> 00:47:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.170 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that you are
responsible for what you think,

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:50.000 align:middle line:84%
because it is only at this level
that you can exercise choice.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.250 align:middle line:84%
What you do comes
from what you think.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:57.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Do not try to look beyond
yourself for truth,

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.330 align:middle line:84%
for truth can only
be within you.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:08.110 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:10%
>>My interest in the
"Course of Miracles"

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.490 align:middle line:10%
began some years ago
when I was doing research

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.610 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
California on meditation

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.220 align:middle line:10%
and different
schools of religion.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.500 align:middle line:10%
And someone showed me
a copy of the "Course,"

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.340 align:middle line:10%
and I reacted with
great skepticism

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:27.800 align:middle line:10%
and refused to look at
it for a couple of years.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.540 align:middle line:10%
Until when I finally did,
I was quite surprised

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.210 align:middle line:10%
and surprisingly impressed,
particularly by two things.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:84%
One was that I found there was a
psychological system within it,

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.010 align:middle line:84%
which was very sophisticated
and on a par, in many ways,

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:47.400 align:middle line:84%
with some contemporary
thinking in Western psychology.

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing that
surprised and impressed me

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:53.140 align:middle line:84%
was that it became
clear that this seemed

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:57.810 align:middle line:84%
to represent an example of the
underlying perennial wisdom,

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:02.260 align:middle line:84%
which seems to lie at the core
of the world's great religions.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.380 align:middle line:10%
>>The course was
intended for self-study,

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.640 align:middle line:10%
and it has been translated
into many languages

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.050 align:middle line:10%
by the foundation.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.530 align:middle line:10%
But it is here, in
Roscoe, New York,

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.810 align:middle line:10%
at the Foundation for
A Course in Miracles,

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.330 align:middle line:10%
that co-founders Kenneth
and Gloria Wapnick

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.500 align:middle line:10%
offer classes for
students who desire

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.470 align:middle line:10%
to pursue the "Course" in depth.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:20.970 align:middle line:10%
>>It's called "A
Course in Miracles"

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:25.140 align:middle line:10%
because it's the miracle that
is the central process whereby

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.390 align:middle line:10%
our minds are healed.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:10%
The "Course" teaches
us that the problem

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.647 align:middle line:10%
is that we've forgotten
that we even have a mind.

00:49:30.647 --> 00:49:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And so there's like
a veil of amnesia,

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.610 align:middle line:90%
which has fallen across us.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.675 align:middle line:84%
And we live in this
world, living our lives,

00:49:36.675 --> 00:49:39.252 align:middle line:84%
as Thoreau said, in
quiet desperation,

00:49:39.252 --> 00:49:40.960 align:middle line:84%
never really knowing
what the problem is.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So we live lives of pain, of
suffering, of love and hate,

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.997 align:middle line:90%
of ups and downs.

00:49:46.997 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
But never knowing that the
source of all of our problems

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:84%
lies in a choice that
our mind has made.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:53.555 align:middle line:84%
And what the "Miracle"
does is restore to our mind

00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:56.940 align:middle line:84%
the awareness that
we do have a mind,

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.497 align:middle line:84%
and that within this mind
is a power of choice.

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So where before we
have chosen the ego

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.009 align:middle line:84%
thought system of attack
and guilt and fear,

00:50:04.009 --> 00:50:06.300 align:middle line:84%
now we can choose the thought
system of the Holy Spirit

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
forgive and how to love.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The central concept of "A Course
in Miracles" is forgiveness.

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful
line which really summarizes

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:84%
this that says the holiest
spot on all the Earth

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is when ancient hatred
has become a present love,

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.180 align:middle line:84%
that thee holiest spot
on Earth is not a place.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not a church.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It is not a shrine.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the altar within our
minds when we choose, finally,

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to forgive somebody
against whom we've

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.550 align:middle line:90%
held a terrible grievance.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And by asking Jesus
for help, we're

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:39.870 align:middle line:84%
able to shift the way
that we see this person.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of his
becoming an ancient enemy,

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.520 align:middle line:84%
he now suddenly becomes
our friend and our brother

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and our companion back home.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.430 align:middle line:10%
>>I think the "Course"
is so important

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:54.710 align:middle line:10%
because it has a different
type of spirituality

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:56.650 align:middle line:10%
than other paths
because you don't

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.715 align:middle line:10%
have to leave the
world or your situation

00:50:58.715 --> 00:51:01.500 align:middle line:10%
or your family or your job.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.337 align:middle line:84%
You can stay right put where you
are and practice the "Course."

00:51:04.337 --> 00:51:05.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go off to a mountain

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.200 align:middle line:90%
or an ashram or a monastery.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the main teaching of
the "Course" is forgiveness.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you practice these
lessons of forgiveness

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:17.180 align:middle line:84%
as you go along with
the "Course" day by day,

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
minute by minute, in your life,
in your job, in your family.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have, as the
"Course" teaches us,

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.810 align:middle line:84%
a right mind, where
there is a correction

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:29.400 align:middle line:84%
for each wrong-minded thought
of the ego thought system.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And so as I'm going
through my day,

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and I feel myself
getting upset and angry,

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I have an internal teacher
that the "Course" says

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.370 align:middle line:84%
is either Jesus or the Holy
Spirit, and I can ask for help.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And in that instant, I
can shift my perception--

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
"Course" calls a miracle--

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and I can have that anger
changed to a new perception

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and let it go
through this process

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:84%
that the "Course"
calls forgiveness.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.710 align:middle line:10%
>>When I started to read
"A Course in Miracles"

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:01.220 align:middle line:10%
and recognize that to
forgive is to overlook,

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.670 align:middle line:10%
that selective
remembering helped

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.590 align:middle line:10%
in the process of forgiveness.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.010 align:middle line:10%
To choose only the
thoughts of love

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:16.150 align:middle line:10%
and forget those of aggression,
fear, denial, anger.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:84%
That in that attitude, based
upon a spiritual concept

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that we are not our bodies,
but we are, in truth, spirit.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.960 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
could understand

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.990 align:middle line:84%
what the "Course" meant
when it said to forgive

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.690 align:middle line:90%
is not to condone.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not to make
error real, but rather

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that what you
thought someone has done to you

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:48.010 align:middle line:90%
has never in truth occurred.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Has never in truth occurred
was so startling to me.

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Because of course it occurs.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:90%
We see it every day.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.020 align:middle line:90%
We experience it every moment.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, it's saying,
in the metaphysical reality,

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:04.840 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual truth, in God's
world, it has not occurred.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Only by shifting our thought
from the ego's thought system

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to that of God can we dare
to accomplish forgiveness.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:17.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the bad news.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.770 align:middle line:84%
The good news is we have a
friend, the voice within us,

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the eternal forgiver, the
higher guide, the higher self,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.660 align:middle line:90%
anything we choose to call it.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's that, that
great transformer within,

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that helps in the
process of forgiving.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So it became then
very, very specific,

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.890 align:middle line:84%
the guidelines I was
given for forgiveness.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Number one, recognize
I had a problem,

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.470 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't feeling peaceful,
and that I was holding

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.770 align:middle line:84%
a negative feeling
about someone.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Recognize it.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Bring it to the surface.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Confront it.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.950 align:middle line:90%
All within myself, of course.

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And the second, recognize
that I wanted peace,

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:04.180 align:middle line:84%
that I really wanted
to see it differently,

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.720 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to change my mind.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to hold this
grudge, this grievance,

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.440 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Number three, know that I
couldn't accomplish this

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.840 align:middle line:90%
by myself.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, my small
self, my ego self.

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Number four, turn it
over to the higher self.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Say, take this mess.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle it.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I really surrender it to you.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I ask you to take it from me and
to show me what true vision is.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that happens,
one can be sure

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that the situation
is transformed,

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that one does see
with different eyes.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:90%
I call it realize.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I begin to realize what that
other human being is to me.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:51.320 align:middle line:84%
More than a brother or a
sister, more than a friend,

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:90%
that person is myself.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.720 align:middle line:84%
In that sense, I am not
my brother's keeper.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I am that other.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:03.550 align:middle line:84%
No one can do
anything to one's self

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:07.790 align:middle line:84%
when one is looking at the
world through one's higher self.

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes a system of
such safety and protection

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.840 align:middle line:90%
that it has great dividends.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.026 align:middle line:84%
>>The "Course" has
a very unusual way

00:55:17.026 --> 00:55:18.400 align:middle line:84%
of defining
forgiveness, and that

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is that you forgive your brother
for what he has not done,

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.030 align:middle line:84%
not for what he
has done, which is

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:25.790 align:middle line:84%
the usual way of
looking at forgiveness.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And what that means on
one very important level

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:31.800 align:middle line:84%
is that what I accuse you
of, what I hold against you,

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.490 align:middle line:84%
is that it's because of you
that I no longer experience

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.160 align:middle line:90%
the love or the peace of God.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.610 align:middle line:84%
That before you
came into my life,

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or before you said or did this
awful thing, I felt wonderful.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden, my life has
crumbled, and it's your fault.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.000 align:middle line:84%
What the course helps us to
understand, on the other hand,

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.520 align:middle line:84%
is that there's no one and
nothing in this world that

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.810 align:middle line:84%
has the power to take
God's peace away from me,

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:53.220 align:middle line:84%
except my own mind
if I choose to see

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.960 align:middle line:90%
myself as separate from it.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
what I forgive you for

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.230 align:middle line:84%
is that you have not taken
the peace of God away from me.

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what I have to
do is to forgive myself

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:84%
because it was my mistaken
choice that caused me

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.560 align:middle line:84%
all the pain and not
something you have done.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And what allows us to do
this is the role of Jesus

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.780 align:middle line:84%
or the Holy Spirit, that
basically what Jesus says to us

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.450 align:middle line:84%
in our minds is take
my hand, use my eyes,

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and look at your brother
the way that I see him.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll see that
this person is just like you.

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.120 align:middle line:84%
He shares the same
insanity you do.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.180 align:middle line:84%
He's part of the
same faulty thought

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.580 align:middle line:84%
system that you are part
of, and that he also

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.060 align:middle line:90%
yearns as you do to return home.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And so rather than seeing
my brother or my sister

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:84%
as separate and
different from me,

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I see them as people
walking along the same road

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.310 align:middle line:90%
back to heaven as I am.

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's the love of
Jesus which really

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.060 align:middle line:90%
helps us make that shift.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:52.847 align:middle line:84%
>>What could you want
forgiveness cannot give?

00:56:52.847 --> 00:56:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you want peace?

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness offers it.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you want happiness, a quiet
mind, a certainty of purpose,

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of worth and beauty
that transcends the world?

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.955 align:middle line:90%


00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:21.171 align:middle line:84%
Do you want care and safety and
the warmth of sure protection

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:21.670 align:middle line:90%
always?

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.490 align:middle line:84%
All of this
forgiveness offers you.

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Forgive the world, and you will
understand that everything that

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:35.610 align:middle line:90%
God created cannot have an end.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And nothing he did
not create is real.

00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:47.980 align:middle line:84%
In this one sentence is
our course explained.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>There certainly does appear to
be a spiritual awakening going

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:52.340 align:middle line:90%
on in our age.

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, if you contrast the
'90s with the '40s and '50s

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.660 align:middle line:84%
when I grew up, things are
certainly much different.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.910 align:middle line:90%
God is no longer a dirty word.

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Angels are spoken about freely.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Miracles are talked about.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly feel
that the "Course"

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.907 align:middle line:84%
is like an integral part
of that new movement.

00:58:08.907 --> 00:58:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And on that line, I think
it's extremely important

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:13.199 align:middle line:84%
to mention something that
the "Course" says of itself

00:58:13.199 --> 00:58:14.990 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the "Teacher's Manual."

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is that it's not
the only spiritual path.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:18.588 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it says
that it's only one

00:58:18.588 --> 00:58:21.505 align:middle line:84%
path among many thousands
of the universal course.

00:58:21.505 --> 00:58:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's
extremely important

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to mention so that people don't
believe that the "Course" is

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.330 align:middle line:84%
just another dogmatic
set of teachings,

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:32.092 align:middle line:84%
and that we're seeing the
birth of a new church.

00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus in the
"Course" says also

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.924 align:middle line:84%
that he's not the
only person who

00:58:34.924 --> 00:58:37.930 align:middle line:84%
has awakened from the dream, and
that he's not the only helper,

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that there are dozens
and dozens and dozens.

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.832 align:middle line:84%
But he is one major symbol
for us in the Western world,

00:58:43.832 --> 00:58:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and "A Course in
Miracles," I think

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:48.074 align:middle line:84%
is a major expression of
his teachings to all of us.

00:58:48.074 --> 00:58:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Beyond the body, beyond the
sun and stars, past everything

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.920 align:middle line:84%
you see and yet
somehow familiar,

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:04.870 align:middle line:84%
is an arc of golden
light that stretches

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:09.410 align:middle line:84%
as you look into a great
and shining circle.

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And all the circle fills
with light before your eyes.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:21.600 align:middle line:84%
The edges of the
circle disappear,

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and what is in it is no
longer contained at all.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.540 align:middle line:84%
The light expands and
covers everything,

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:35.070 align:middle line:84%
extending to infinity,
forever shining,

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and with no break
or limit anywhere.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Within it, everything is
joined in perfect continuity.

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Nor is it possible to imagine
that anything could be outside.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.762 align:middle line:90%


00:59:51.762 --> 00:59:54.780 align:middle line:84%
For there is nowhere
that this light is not.

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:03.040 align:middle line:84%
What is a miracle,
but this remembering?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.325 align:middle line:84%
And who is there in whom
this memory lies not?

01:00:09.325 --> 01:00:14.060 align:middle line:84%
The light in one
awakens it in all.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
it in your brother,

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
you are remembering
for everyone.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:01:19.830 align:middle line:90%
