the origin of these

the existence of aliens.

started to unleash themself

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in full force, and I started

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
many people,
because this I think

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:90%
is actually my first experience.

I wanted to be going
to bed, and I was

going to sleep, I thought, hm?

00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a blue light
coming through the blinds.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
wonder what that is,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and I just went to
sleep immediately.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.182 align:middle line:84%

if I had stuck in an outlet.

like electrocuted, practically.

finally stopped, and I got up,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to shake
it off, and I just

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%

something just not right

me really physical,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
to go to the bathroom, which
wasn't nothing unusual,

at this being that was standing

stop this.

lying down on the
couch and a white light

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
hitting me in the forehead and
feeling paralysis and waking up

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
the next morning and
being very afraid and very

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:84%
freaked out and somewhat
traumatized, to use that word,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:90%

I thought you were crying.

I mean I felt like
he was visibly shaken

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
enough that there were
tears in his eyes,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%

him like that before.

to sleep, and again,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
tickle in the back of my
head like a little finger.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.064 align:middle line:90%
That was all it took.

00:08:49.064 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
[GASPS] And I just kind
of froze, and I think

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I stopped breathing
for a minute.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I got really
panicked, and then boom.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Blackout.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Wake up again.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes later.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Arms now down to my side,
body paralyzed with this very

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
physical, electrical feeling
running up and down it--

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:90%
not just paralyzed, can't move--

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
electricity running
through my body.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Vroom, vroom.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
vroom.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Totally scared, going, what
in the hell is going on now?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't open my eyes, and I feel
a footstep on end of the bed.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.815 align:middle line:90%
I have big down comforters.

00:09:29.815 --> 00:09:30.841 align:middle line:90%
It's squishy.

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
What in the hell could
be on the end of the bed?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Is it-- is it a cow?

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean the brain just goes
through these really weird

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not a cow.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it a dog?

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it a cat?

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't have a dog.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a cat.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it a baby?

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a baby.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it a mouse?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:90%
No, it's too heavy for a mouse.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.115 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going through
all the physical things

00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:90%
that-- what can be on my bed?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And as my brain is just
going 90 miles an hour

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
running through the Rolodex
of possibilities that are all

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.374 align:middle line:90%
coming up, eh, not that.

00:09:55.374 --> 00:09:58.289 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:58.289 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there's contact.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's sort of a wave
of calm that followed it,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and I stopped breathing so hard.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:17.025 align:middle line:84%
And it says, now you
can open your eyes.

00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I almost wanted
to pass out again.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.329 align:middle line:84%
My eyes finally open, and I
can peripherally see my room

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:90%
around me in the ambient light.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I always had light
on in the house.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this
thing, and the first thing

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that I can get to even come
to my mind is Jesus Christ,

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:90%
you look like a fucking bug.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Having had that experience
and having it just mark me,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:54.519 align:middle line:84%
so having it brand
to me like that,

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:90%
my life will never be the same.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>After that initial experience,
for the next several nights,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember just being
kind of freaked out like,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:90%
what was that?

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Like that is the strangest
experience I've ever had.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of
going about our daily

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
lives, going back to
managing the hotel,

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.622 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was
a few weeks later--

00:11:23.622 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
might have been two
or three weeks later.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem like a
long period of time,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
but within a few
weeks' time, I remember

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
lying in bed again and waking
up, being startled, and feeling

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
something at the side of the
bed and being totally terrified

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and trying to wake Jamy up.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And Jamy couldn't wake up--

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and feeling some kind of
energy go into my lower spine,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and it felt like it was just
sucking the life out of me.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And then passing out again
and waking up in the morning,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
waking up with marks behind my
ears, behind my ear, and again,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
being visibly--

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.966 align:middle line:84%
being very shaken emotionally
about what my experience

00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:90%
was the night before.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>I had enrolled in graduate
school back here in Boston,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and Peter was at
acupuncture school.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
So again, we were--

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
we had come back here to
plan a way to work together.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean everything was in service
of our looking at our lives

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:90%
vocationally together.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Jamy, you're all coordinated.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>I know.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.692 align:middle line:84%
>>It was probably in the
middle of my second year

00:12:41.692 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
of three-year training
at the New England

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
School of Acupuncture,
one of my classmates

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
was telling the story of how he
was working at Cambridge City

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Hospital as an
administrative assistant,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
psychiatrist there,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.193 align:middle line:84%
who was working with
people who thought they

00:12:55.193 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:90%
had been abducted by aliens.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's a combination
of adventurousness.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking for
excitement, adventure,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and a certain naivete.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I don't
always see the minefields.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>I think he is intelligent,
highly intelligent.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I think he's very gifted.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:90%
He writes very well.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Won a Pulitzer Prize for
writing a very good book.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:84%
You can't be chopped
liver and get

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to be a professor of
psychiatry at Harvard.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:10%
You have to be very good,
and he has, I think,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:10%
jeopardized his reputation among
a lot of serious-minded people

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:10%
for behaving the way he has.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Carl Sagan says gratuitously
on the basis of nothing,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:90%
this is hallucinations.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote an article on that.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do any work.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.072 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what does he know
about hallucinations anyway?

00:13:57.072 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
In 1989, a psychologist asked me
if I want to meet Budd Hopkins.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, who's he?

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, he's an
artist in New York City, who

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:84%
works with people, who have
had the experience of being

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:90%
abducted by aliens.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, come on.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%
You know, you believe this?

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
He told me about people from
all over the country, who

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't know each other, who
were reporting virtually

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.932 align:middle line:90%
the same story.

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm a clinical
psychiatrist,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:90%
so I work with data.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Your data is the people
you're working with.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
That data operated like
sulfuric acid to my worldview.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean it just didn't
compute at all.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean my smart ass mind
couldn't do anything with that.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Then he asked me if I wanted
to see them myself in Boston

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:90%
as part of my practice.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how much
I hesitated about that.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean I don't remember.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I think I agreed to
it pretty readily.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But I sort of knew I was
embarking on something.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And then they began to come.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>It was pouring rain that day.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:90%
It was just really pouring.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.282 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we went
into John's office,

00:15:26.282 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
specifically, you know, we

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:90%
go into this regular hospital.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we introduced
ourselves to John,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
took some basic
information about us.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
He turned to Peter and said,
so do you want to tell me

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.494 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I can remember John going,
just lean back, just like that.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.372 align:middle line:84%
So Peter leaned back, and John
asked him like one question,

00:15:47.372 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
something like, why don't you
tell me what happened to you,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Peter?

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
Peter closes his eyes

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:90%
and just starts crying.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>And I had this
well of emotions

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%
come boiling out of me.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And this was--

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I had gone there just
out of curiosity.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping John would
tell me, oh, these

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:90%
are just dreams, nightmares.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
In my wildest dreams,
I never thought

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
that I would walk in there and
walk out of there thinking, oh,

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:84%
my god, I have to
possibly think that I've

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.008 align:middle line:90%
had contact with aliens.

00:16:21.008 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>I learned about Karin
around early August of 1996.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:90%
She wrote a letter to me.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:84%
She said, not only
are we not alone,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:90%
but we're really not alone.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.493 align:middle line:90%
And I liked that.

Karin's life was
where she would go

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
was regulated by what she
calls pops, and she would

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.355 align:middle line:84%
get a pop, which would
mean, suddenly, she

00:16:56.355 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
would decide to leave wherever
she was and go somewhere else.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a mixture of
impulsivity and intuitiveness.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>And within a month or
two, I was in Boston,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
and then that's when my
relationship with John began.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
We pretty quickly got into
working with the experiences,

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and all of my sessions,
probably almost without fail,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
were really, really intense.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>She has a remarkable
capacity to look at herself,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to face head on her
experiences, her emotions,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%

them, if you help her.

>>And he asked me, when
was the first time that you

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:90%
made contact with these beings?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And my brain went all
the way back to when

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I was just a little kid.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I think I was about
two and 1/2 years old.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:84%
My mom had presented me with
a new bubble gum machine,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:90%
and I loved it.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I was playing by
a dry creek bed,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and it was just next
to the house, all

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
by myself with the
bubble gum machine.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little
being that was sticking out

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:84%
from behind the tree with
really large black eyes that

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted to ask me a
question-- would I

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:90%
be willing to go with him?

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
We got into this sort
of egg-shaped thing,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and I looked up to see
this other being coming in

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
with a little boy, and he
was leading by the hand.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And the little boy
seemed to be older than I

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:90%
was by a couple of years.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And he-- the being
with the little boy

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
walked him up to
just in front of me.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was asked if I would be
willing to share my bubble gum

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%
machine with him.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And I handed it over.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:56.275 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we were being
introduced for the first time.

00:18:56.275 --> 00:18:58.025 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember too
much more after that,

00:18:58.025 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:90%
but we were separated.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And when the egg opened again,
I was back by the creek bed.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.305 align:middle line:84%
The very next thing
I remembered was--

00:19:11.305 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
as if there had been no cut in
the frame, was all of a sudden,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I was mid-stride running
in toward the house.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find
my bubble gum machine.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:10%
>>So I went back out,
and we looked for it,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:10%
and we just couldn't
find it anywhere around

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.192 align:middle line:10%
on the edge of the
creek or whatever.

00:19:28.192 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of clueless.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.678 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was it
was really gone.

00:19:30.678 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:90%

regression session,

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:84%
where I laid on the
table or laid on the bed,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and John counted me
back and 10 to one

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and asked me to do some
deep breathing relaxation,

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and then asked me to
go into the memories

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
again and see what
else was there.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.106 align:middle line:84%
>>Journey into the unknown,
and see where it goes.

>>I'm sitting in my bed,

It's outside my window.

00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:90%
They're standing there.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.446 align:middle line:90%

down, surrounds us.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And we just float up.

>>I'm in the ship.

all these things.

else that needs to come out.

>>OK.

00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:90%

tell me there's a reason for

You know, tell me I
was abused as a kid.

Tell me, you know,
there's a reason here

you know what I just realized?

Your mother is from England.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, but you know what?

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:90%
She has a green card, right?

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say, yes.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so she's
an alien, right?

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>John was really up front.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't
have to do this.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm here if you want
to explore this.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll work with you through this.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
place where I just

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
knew I had to do it to
put my own demons to rest.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>I exhausted the psychological.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to the
spiritual, you know.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And then I was into--

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I was into it's really a
manifestation of the divine.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Really, the aliens
may not-- maybe

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
you have to say
that they're alien,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they're really--
maybe it's really God.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
different theories.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:90%

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.055 align:middle line:90%
holds up scientifically.

00:32:28.055 --> 00:32:31.499 align:middle line:84%
Ah, at last, we can explain
this in a conventional way.

00:32:31.499 --> 00:32:32.915 align:middle line:84%
The fact that
people aren't asleep

00:32:32.915 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:84%
when it happens--
that, they overlook.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems to me the most
obvious and elementary thing

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that any rational
person would want to do

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is to try to verify that
objectively by seeing,

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:90%
were there any witnesses?

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>There was, I think,
in February of 1992,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in New York, and I was
traveling with three women

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.746 align:middle line:90%
coming back to Boston.

00:32:55.746 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a Saturday
night, and we decided

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.444 align:middle line:84%
to stay over outside of
New Haven, Connecticut.

00:33:00.444 --> 00:33:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.925 align:middle line:90%
Sunday morning, we got up.

00:33:06.925 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
The three women I was with
decided to go for a walk,

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't feeling good, so
I decided to stay in the house.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I found myself nodding
out in the chair.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Next thing I know, I wake up.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I look at my watch.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly like an hour
and five minutes later,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.415 align:middle line:84%
and the three women come
rushing into the house

00:33:24.415 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, my god, Peter.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Did you see the UFO?

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.227 align:middle line:84%
We just saw a UFO
over the house.

00:33:28.227 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:90%
You know, let's call the police.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's report this right away.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:36.915 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea what to
think or what to expect.

00:33:36.915 --> 00:33:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was
totally freaked out,

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
because these women, these
three people I was traveling

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.720 align:middle line:84%
with had no idea about
my work with John,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.827 align:middle line:84%
had no idea of my
memories, had no idea what

00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:90%
I was going through.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I had never talked about it.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
They came in and said
they just saw a UFO.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:90%
They were all freaked out.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:90%
They had never seen a UFO.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:84%
To this day, I've
never seen a UFO.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:84%
A few days later, all
these memories and feelings

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:84%
came up of actually having a
being coming into that room

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and taking me out and
going up into the ship,

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:84%
while the three women
were on this walk,

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:84%
while there was
nobody in the house.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm curious why anybody--

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean you or anybody else--

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
would want to
somehow find a kind

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of Western conventional
explanation for this anyway.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean there isn't a culture on
the planet that doesn't take it

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:84%
as perfectly routine that
there are visitations

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:84%
coming from outside of us
beings of all kinds, energies

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:10%
>>People have always
everywhere believed

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:10%
that there is a parallel
world to ours, which

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:10%
is inhabited by what the
Greeks call daemonaes, daemons.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, traditionally,
the parallel world

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:84%
was a world of fairies or elves,
as the Anglo Saxons is called.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I see no reason to
suppose that, you know,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:84%
the aliens aren't connected with
just traditional daemons, who

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:90%
everyone's always believed in.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
me that, you know,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
our culture, modern
Western culture

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is eccentric in
not believing this.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The thing about daemons
is that people always,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:90%
always believe in them as real.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can't say they're
not literally real,

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and you can't say they're
only metaphorically real.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
both, because they

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.561 align:middle line:84%
belong to a worldview, which
doesn't make that distinction.

00:35:41.561 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The aliens, like us, must
be made of two things--

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
spirit and matter,
which is soul and body.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:36:00.270 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But aliens must
be superior to us,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:84%
because their soul is not
as attached to the body.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, where is it
written that only one planet is

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
inhabitable, for heaven's sake?

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to see for myself if
this happens in other cultures,

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and if so, how
they interpret it.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We decided to go to
Brazil, but in truth, we

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
could have gone
just about anywhere.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.334 align:middle line:84%
>>This phenomenon is
happening all over the world.

00:36:38.334 --> 00:36:42.206 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:51.000 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>The Brazilian
worldview I think

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:84%
is different from the
American, because maybe we

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:84%
see things more emotionally
or more from our hearts.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Brazil is more open to
other realities like spirits

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and the paranormal phenomena,
but the alien phenomena,

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:84%
when it started in Brazil,
was difficult to believe in it

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.250 align:middle line:90%
or even to accept it.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:10%
I met John Mack at the Abduction
Study Conference held at EMIT.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:29.740 align:middle line:10%
And for me, it was very
important to see a psychiatrist

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.330 align:middle line:10%
from the United States, who
was researching abduction

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.750 align:middle line:10%
with a different country for
me and a different culture.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I arrived to the
similar conclusion.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Why me?

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Choose somebody else.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't need this, you know.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I have a family.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I have a job.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I have a normal life.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do this.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.372 align:middle line:90%
You know, why?

00:37:52.372 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
It happened when I
was 10 years old when

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the middle of the
night, saw this blue light,

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and it came out to me
and to inside my head.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I went to see what it was.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I saw that big,
big, big spaceship.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.572 align:middle line:90%
And then I was--

00:38:14.572 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see anything more.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.770 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what happened next.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.100 align:middle line:84%
About three years ago,
I had this vision.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It came, and I could
only see his face.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.120 align:middle line:90%
He was all light.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:84%
That was the only time
that I saw him, actually.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
He told me that he would need
my help to come to this planet.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
He would need my
body to stay here.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.690 align:middle line:90%
He's Ishta.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.850 align:middle line:90%
He's from another planet.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he's on a
mission to come over here.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.800 align:middle line:90%
And I guess a lot of them come.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:84%
They use these humans
to get to know what

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:90%
is happening on this planet.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I think he wants
to take my life.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I really don't
care, because he's

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.530 align:middle line:90%
much more powerful than I am.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>When I started
research in 1980,

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.982 align:middle line:90%
I had this great question.

00:39:24.982 --> 00:39:26.565 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if those
people are crazy

00:39:26.565 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:84%
or if those people are
really having an experience.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.670 align:middle line:84%
After dealing with the
process all the time,

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:84%
the only thing I can say-- we
don't know what make it happen,

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:90%
but it's happening.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And those people can become
crazy from the experience.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
creating the experience,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.240 align:middle line:90%
because they are crazy.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.500 align:middle line:90%
This is very clear to me now.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:90%


00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>My mother told me when I
was four or five years old,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I used to get out of my bed
and go out to the backyard

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.260 align:middle line:90%
to watch the stars.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.530 align:middle line:84%
She would come outside and say,
boy, what are you doing up?

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And I always used to
say, I don't like here.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to
the place I came from.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.490 align:middle line:84%
About three or
four months ago, I

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.760 align:middle line:84%
had a problem in my right
ear, and as a musician,

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:84%
an ear problem is the worst
thing that could happen to me.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Every kind of sound or
voice on the right ear

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:84%
sounded to me like
a metallic sound.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I went to an ear doctor,
who checked my ear

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and told me everything was fine.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:84%
That night, near dawn,
when I tried to get up,

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:84%
There was a familiar sensation
to me, and I said to myself,

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:84%
there's something
weird going on.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I immediately felt a
presence in the bedroom.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:90%
My wife next to me was sleeping.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I tried to call to
her to wake her up,

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't
even move a finger.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.160 align:middle line:84%
With a lot of effort, I
was able to open my eyes,

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and I could see
two small beings.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.390 align:middle line:84%
One was standing at
the foot of my bed,

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and the other by my left side.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger one
that I couldn't see,

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I only saw its shadow.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I felt them put a pointed object
in my right nostril, which

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.570 align:middle line:90%
all the way to my skull.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:26.740 align:middle line:90%
And something was done there.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
They took that pointed
object out of my nose,

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the two little
beings quickly leave.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.210 align:middle line:90%
The bigger one said, be calm.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Be calm, and vanished.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I started moving my fingers
and tasted something like oil

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.960 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had any problems
with that ear since.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So it is really a
fantastic phenomenon,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:90%
which is not totally explained.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe anymore that
these beings are necessarily

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:03.160 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial aliens
from another planet

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.245 align:middle line:84%
or visitors like
in science fiction.

00:42:05.245 --> 00:42:08.890 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I think they may be something
else, maybe spiritual beings

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.223 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:42:15.223 --> 00:42:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>We don't know
really what they are.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't know even in what
way reality this is happening.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And even if this is just
a projection in the mind,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.900 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.380 align:middle line:90%
But follow the same pattern.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the most
characteristic element

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:90%
is the perception of light.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And the light seems to
have a certain power in it.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.014 align:middle line:84%
>>And I was going down
to sleep, I thought, hm,

00:42:46.014 --> 00:42:48.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a blue light
coming through.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>I woke up with the light.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.682 align:middle line:90%
>>I wonder what that is.

00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And I just went to sleep.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>The light was very bright
and very blue, very, very blue.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>White light hits
me in the forehead,

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.835 align:middle line:84%
and I find myself
like paralyzed.

00:43:00.835 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>The light seems to
contain within itself

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
some kind of special energy
that can move people.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The light comes
and over the person.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Often, they really do feel
that their physical body

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.500 align:middle line:90%
is taken.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.834 align:middle line:84%
>>They feel they are
being taken by the light.

00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>They're not in
the room anymore,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and they are floating is
the word they usually use.

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I have memories of feeling
myself very clearly, you know,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.540 align:middle line:84%
being floated out
of the living room.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>And then I felt myself being
lifted up and out and watch

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:84%
myself go through the
French doors and through--

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Onto the deck of our house.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>They get taken up into
some kind of a craft.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>And kind of being
lifted up into the ship.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>And up into the
bottom of the ship

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't very far
away in this pink, peach,

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.810 align:middle line:90%
sort of orangish-reddy light.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>A classic kind of
in a beam of light.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.452 align:middle line:84%
>>Sometimes there will be humans
working alongside the aliens

00:43:59.452 --> 00:44:01.276 align:middle line:90%
or the typical humanoid grays.

00:44:01.276 --> 00:44:03.025 align:middle line:84%
>>They go to about the
middle of my chest,

00:44:03.025 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:84%
so it's about probably
four, four and 1/2.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>It had this gray head.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Their grayish skin color.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Pointy chin, these
large, liquid black eyes.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Kind of pear-shaped heads
with large, large eyes,

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.990 align:middle line:90%
almond-shaped eyes.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.567 align:middle line:84%
>>No nose that I could
really tell, no lips.

00:44:20.567 --> 00:44:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Just sort of a slit for a mouth.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Kind of snakeskinnish,
kind of like that very smooth

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.020 align:middle line:84%
or sharkskin or
kind of fish skin.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Beings, reptilian
beings, insect-like beings,

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.600 align:middle line:84%
praying mantis-like
beings, and then procedures

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.360 align:middle line:84%
occur, which involve
examinations, poking.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>I was on a table in the ship,
and they shoved this needle

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.090 align:middle line:90%
into my belly.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my god, I'm
going to die from this pain.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.285 align:middle line:84%
>>Very distinct,
two puncture marks.

00:44:50.285 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.200 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't red and raised
like a normal bite,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.490 align:middle line:90%
spider bite would be.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall, it
healed very quickly.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.990 align:middle line:90%
It healed unusual.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>I woke up the next morning
from this really nasty

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.730 align:middle line:90%
experience of the puncture gun.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I had three puncture
marks in my belly leftover

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that healed in this really
strange way, very quickly,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.870 align:middle line:84%
like with three little
sunburn marks on them.

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>One night, I come
home, and I walk in,

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and Peter is sitting
in the living room.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:84%
There's this bottle of
whiskey next to him.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Now Peter doesn't drink.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.858 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, a glass
of wine or something,

00:45:36.858 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:84%
but this bottle of whiskey or
bourbon or something like that.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.430 align:middle line:84%
There's this ashtray
full of cigarette butts,

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and he doesn't smoke either.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And like the whiskey
bottle is like half filled,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and he was just like in a daze.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just walked in and was
like, oh, my god, what's wrong?

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.320 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was just like,
I can't handle it.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.680 align:middle line:90%
This is way too much.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.870 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going through is
just over the top, you know.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember wanting to share
it with him about my life,

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and he was like, Jamy, I
can't be there for you.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:11.590 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm like going through
too much myself.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
in relationships.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it does.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But usually, there are
things that somebody can name

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.490 align:middle line:84%
or something that
you can say, this

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.740 align:middle line:90%
is why he is going through that.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But what am I supposed
to say to people?

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, my husband thinks he's
been abducted by aliens.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.860 align:middle line:84%
He's had nine regressions
with a psychiatrist

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard University,
and he's not available.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:84%
He's not even in
his body anymore,

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even-- we don't
even talk to each other.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>But let's get into it.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:84%
What is this learning
that you're there

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.260 align:middle line:90%
for about the future?

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>It has to do with this the
one on my left, the woman,

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.000 align:middle line:84%
thinks she's going
to be my teacher.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.570 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be my
guardian or something.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.732 align:middle line:90%
She's going to watch for me.

00:47:05.732 --> 00:47:07.565 align:middle line:84%
There's something that's
going to transpire.

00:47:07.565 --> 00:47:08.632 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:47:08.632 --> 00:47:09.432 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:47:09.432 --> 00:47:11.770 align:middle line:90%
What'd you get?

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>That we're going to--

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:18.075 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.075 --> 00:47:19.186 align:middle line:90%
we're going to fuck.

00:47:19.186 --> 00:47:19.582 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:47:19.582 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>That we're going to fuck.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>You and this woman?

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Right then and there.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.404 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I mean that's what just--

00:47:27.404 --> 00:47:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Is there a desire that
came up for you then,

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:90%
or it's just a thought?

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it wasn't a desire.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.080 align:middle line:90%
It was a fear.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.913 align:middle line:84%
>>A fear that you're
going to fuck with her.

00:47:33.913 --> 00:47:36.840 align:middle line:90%


00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>God.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Everything just sank.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.803 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm going
to breed with her.

00:47:44.803 --> 00:47:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>That's what's happening.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.884 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:47:48.884 --> 00:47:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
shocking about that?

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.872 align:middle line:84%
>>John, what's so
shocking about-- it's not

00:47:56.872 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:84%
every day I wake
and have somebody

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:01.220 align:middle line:84%
tell me I'm breeding
with aliens, you know.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's shocking-- it's
shocking-- it's shocking,

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.110 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't
aware of it before,

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that I had no idea that
that's what was going on.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah?

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>A year ago, I figured
out or whatever, you know,

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I found out that my sperm
was being taken now.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But now to walk into a room and
to actually see the woman I've

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.020 align:middle line:90%
been--

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell if I
have been or if I'm

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.447 align:middle line:90%
supposed to make love to her.

00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>But why would you
need to make love to her

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.446 align:middle line:90%
if they've taken your sperm?

00:48:31.446 --> 00:48:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Why couldn't they do
it some other way?

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.866 align:middle line:90%
Because I mean, the sperm--

00:48:34.866 --> 00:48:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>It's about contact.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It's about-- it's
about connection.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, but they could
have taken your sperm

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and used that for
hybrid baby making

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.670 align:middle line:84%
without necessarily any
connection between you

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and the aliens.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that the future
holds connection between you

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and this female
being is separate,

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is additional
information, is it not,

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.840 align:middle line:90%
than simply taking the sperm?

00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.874 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:48:59.874 --> 00:49:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, yeah.

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
John, this is going
to sound bizarre.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>That's all right.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.967 align:middle line:90%
>>It feels like-- oh, man.

00:49:11.967 --> 00:49:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- I don't
know if I can take this.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It feels like
she's my real wife.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It feels like she's the person
that I'm really connected to,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.850 align:middle line:84%
like I want to say
on a soul level.

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>I was pissed.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I was really pissed, because
I didn't believe it, first

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.700 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It felt too-- and here I
am studying psychology.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It felt too psych-- like there
was some more psychological

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:90%
issue that was at hand.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So that was like the straw
that broke the camel's back.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like there was
some woman he was with.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:59.660 align:middle line:84%
This was like some experience
on another plane of existence

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:04.300 align:middle line:84%
that he had, a
relationship, that he had

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.800 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with someone.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with that?

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:11.479 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with it?

00:50:11.479 --> 00:50:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm trying to say that
I've had this experience

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that the only language
I have for it,

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.290 align:middle line:84%
the vocabulary that
I have to explain

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:23.750 align:middle line:84%
it is this deep, deep heartfelt
connection with this being that

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.610 align:middle line:84%
is on this other
plane that is alien.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>If being with the alien
female is your soulmate

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.460 align:middle line:84%
or if there's some longing to
be connected to something that's

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:84%
not here, then don't
be with me, because I

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:84%
want to be with someone
who wants to be with me

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and connect with
me in this plane,

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:84%
because the alien plane
isn't existing in my life.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:48.710 align:middle line:90%
So then what am I?

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Just an actor, a stand-in
until you get-- until you die?

>>Couple of years
into my experience,

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:05.010 align:middle line:84%
when I was sitting
in a room somewhere--

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it was a ship.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was another
place in another point in time.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:90%
It was very quiet.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:18.680 align:middle line:84%
The lighting was very dim, and
an elder being brought in--

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.710 align:middle line:84%
it was either three or four
of these little beings,

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and they looked very
sort of bluish in color.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:35.714 align:middle line:84%
And they walked over to me
and stood in front of me.

00:51:35.714 --> 00:51:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't have been
much bigger than this.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:39.505 align:middle line:84%
They were very-- they
were quite young still.

00:51:39.505 --> 00:51:42.610 align:middle line:90%


00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one being here
and touching it, touching

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.360 align:middle line:90%
the seat that I was on.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And another one was touching
my legs and another one

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:54.050 align:middle line:84%
touching my legs and
another one over here.

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I looked to the being
who had brought them

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:59.810 align:middle line:84%
in with this
question on my face,

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and the being communicated
that they were mine.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's sad to be
separated from them.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's
nothing I can do.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm just here.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in control of it
at this point in time.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.620 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is continue
to seek to understand it.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.774 align:middle line:84%

them, I would.

I've had about a year and a
half, two years of quiet now.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.920 align:middle line:90%
There's no way that I can--

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:84%
it seems that I can initiate
contact or make a return.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm just sort of left here.

grateful that I don't

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.270 align:middle line:90%
have these experiences anymore.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.180 align:middle line:84%
On another hand,
there's a part of me

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.250 align:middle line:90%
that misses the connection.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.340 align:middle line:90%
I wait and wonder.

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.381 align:middle line:84%
I wonder and wait,

the aliens were doing.

a sperm sample, you know,

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.920 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my 20s?

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, or is there
something much larger here?

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And what's the purpose of it?

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I find it hard to believe

just about you and me.

>>No.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, on one level, it is.

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.590 align:middle line:84%

Do I believe they

Yes.

Yes.

felt like if I didn't

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.050 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get on with my life.

It's that I have this pull here.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:20.106 align:middle line:84%
There's something inside of me
that knows that it's Scotland.

00:58:20.106 --> 00:58:23.720 align:middle line:84%

who had the bubble gum machine

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.669 align:middle line:90%
is of Scottish origin.

that somewhere there's

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:46.397 align:middle line:84%
this grown man now, hopefully
in Scotland, or thinking

00:58:46.397 --> 00:58:47.230 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's Scotland.

I think he has a
Scottish accent--

00:58:49.322 --> 00:58:53.200 align:middle line:84%
who has sitting on his mantle
somewhere this bubble gum

in a strange way

Let's say this person is here.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:15.040 align:middle line:84%
The point is that even
if I'm with someone,

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that still doesn't
solve my dilemma of,

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.740 align:middle line:84%
what am I supposed
to do here and now?

00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:25.610 align:middle line:84%
If I go down this path, meaning
if I stay here in Scotland,

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.680 align:middle line:84%
then my life could
unfold this way.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But if I make a decision in this
moment to go back to America,

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:35.090 align:middle line:84%
will it be that I never
come back here again,

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that I never live
out this reality,

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.660 align:middle line:90%
and is it really my choice?

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:41.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, is there a thing
as destiny, or is there not?

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.220 align:middle line:84%
These are the same
questions that everybody

And somehow it just seems made
a little bit more complicated

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.460 align:middle line:84%
or a little bit more
messy, because somehow, I'm

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.480 align:middle line:84%
always asking this
larger question,

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.092 align:middle line:84%
like what do the aliens
have to do with all this?

00:59:57.092 --> 00:59:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, what does
this experience

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:01.460 align:middle line:90%
have to do with all of this?

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard to know
where the experience ends and I

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.360 align:middle line:90%
begin, you know.

it's extraterrestrial,

whatever it might be.
