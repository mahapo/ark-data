JAY WEIDNER (VOICEOVER): Hi.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jay Weidner, and
welcome to "The Secrets

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of Alchemy-- The Great
Cross and The End of Time."

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Many people ask the
question, what is alchemy?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
This primeval science appears
to be a mysterious affair

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
conducted by our ancestors.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It has been
disparaged by moderns,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and outlawed by both
church and state.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:84%
The answer to this question
is long and involved,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and this series will go a
long way in answering it.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
The short answer is that
alchemy is a science that

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:90%
watches and observes nature.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It attempts to answer the
many mysteries of nature

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
by understanding, first,
the source of nature,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and finally, the outcome
of natural processes.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
In this program, we will
explore one of the greatest

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
alchemical secrets of
all-- the mystery of time,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:90%
and the cycle of the ages.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
From Plato to Pythagoras,
from ancient Greece, Egypt,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and Mesopotamia, our ancestors
knew, wrote, and discussed

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
this mystery, which then flowed
into the underground streams

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Unshackled by the
weight of modernity,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors
understood this mystery,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and applied it to
their daily lives.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.475 align:middle line:10%
My fondest hope is that
this program will help

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:10%
to revive this understanding.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Not just to erase the fog and
mist that surrounds ourselves,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors, and our history,
but also to revive in all of us

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the great hope and promise of
our destiny as human beings.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.815 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of our past,

The journey that would
change my entire life

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:90%
began in Los Angeles in 1986.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
did for fun in Los Angeles,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
when I lived there, I would
spend the weekends perusing

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
the various garage
sales that would

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
happen in the neighborhoods
around where I lived.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I did this mostly to find
odd volumes of books,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:90%
as I was a book collector.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
One Saturday morning, I
discovered a garage sale

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
in North Hollywood.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
An older gentleman had died,
and he'd left all of his books

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:90%
for sale.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious that the
person running the garage sale

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
had no idea what these
books were really worth.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Paying the $1.00 asking
price for the books,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I took them home that day.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the books that I
found at that garage sale

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
was a book called "Mystery
of the Cathedrals,"

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
by an author with the
strange name of Fulcanelli.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:84%
This book, "Mystery
of the Cathedrals,"

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
became the first book that
I read out of the stack

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%
of books I'd bought that day.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that the book was
about the architecture and art

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
of Gothic cathedrals,
I opened the book

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
up only to discover that,
instead of a book on art

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and architecture, I
discovered that the book was

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
actually about that strange
science called alchemy.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
alchemy was practiced

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
by men in their basements,
crazed by mercury vapors,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to change lead into gold
in some vain attempt to get

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:90%
rich quick.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But when I read this
book, I discovered

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:84%
that alchemy was something far
different than I ever imagined.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
What Fulcanelli was
saying in this book

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
was that the secret of
alchemy was engraved

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and embedded in the
architecture and the art

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:90%
of Gothic cathedrals.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.291 align:middle line:84%
The Gothic cathedrals were built
from about 1100 to about 1200,

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
500 cathedrals, approximately,
were built in around 100 years

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:90%
to 150 years.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Each cathedral took 70,
80, 100 years to build.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:10%
Thousands of people
would work on them--

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:10%
artisans and craftsmen,
carpenters, and masons,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:10%
building these cathedrals.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
biggest building projects

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
ever in the history
of the world.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
As big as the pyramids,
or maybe even bigger.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:10%
Not talked much about,
but these cathedrals

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.466 align:middle line:10%
are some of the most stunning
displays of craftsmanship

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:10%
ever in the entire history
of European culture.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.580 align:middle line:10%
Fulcanelli turns
the entire religion

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:10%
around the Gothic
cathedrals, and turns it

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:10%
into a science that looks
into the holistic aspects

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:10%
of our existence, for
that is what alchemy is.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:10%
As opposed to science,
which breaks things down

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:10%
into its smallest form,
alchemy looks at the whole,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:10%
and tries to bring
the whole down.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Science looks down into matter.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.475 align:middle line:90%
Alchemy looks up into spirit.

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And alchemists believe that
life-- what we are here

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
on this planet-- is really
a wedding, or a marriage,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:84%
between the lower
forces of material

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%
and the upper forces of spirit.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And that the human race,
and the human being,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate construct
in this marriage

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%
between these forces.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli is saying that the
Gothic cathedrals were built

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
by alchemists, and
he's telling us

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that the cathedrals themselves
were alchemical experiments.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
That the steeples
of the cathedrals

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
were drawing down
the forces of spirit.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:84%
That the well under
the cathedrals

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
was drawing up the material
forces of life-- Water.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
On the floor of the cathedral
these forces married,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and created a spiritual vortex.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:90%
There is no doubt.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Even historians such
as Daniel Boorstin

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
speak about how the building
of the Gothic cathedrals

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
was the transforming
moment in European history

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
when math, and a literary
sense, and where rationality

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and common sense
became the paradigm

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
of the new culture that
was being created out

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:90%
of the ruins of the Dark Age.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:10%
By 1991, after I'd moved to
Seattle from Los Angeles,

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:10%
I became extremely curious
about the "Mysteries

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:10%
of the Cathedrals," and
the secrets that it held.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
In Seattle, there was a
library called the Seattle

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Metaphysical Library.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I joined this
library, and I happily

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
discovered that
there were thousands

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of books,
all on esoteric matters.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Spending the next few
years perusing the shelves,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
searching for the mystery
behind Fulcanelli,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I uncovered many,
many salient facts

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that would affect the
investigation as it went on.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
In 1926, when "Mystery of
the Cathedrals" by Fulcanelli

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
was first published in Paris,
there was only 300 copies.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
This went out to
the rich people,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and the book became
more of a rumor

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:90%
than having anyone read it.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But the book was reprinted,
en masse, in 1957,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
translated into English, and
then printed en masse in 1959.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:84%
This new edition of
"Mystery of the Cathedrals,"

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:90%
contained a new chapter.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And this chapter was called
"The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye."

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
This fact turned my
attention towards

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:90%
this new additional chapter.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So as I sat down in 1991
and read "The Cyclic Cross

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of Hendaye," the penultimate
chapter in "Mystery

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Cathedrals," I realized
that Fulcanelli had inserted

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:90%
the chapter on purpose.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
That 1926 was not the time for
that chapter to be released.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But 1957, some 30 years
later, was perfect.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was perfect
because "The Cyclic

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Cross of Hendaye"
chapter describes

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:90%
a most extraordinary event.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It is saying-- this cross that
is in a churchyard in the south

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of France-- is saying that there
is going to be a catastrophe--

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
an apocalypse-- that
this age is going to end.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The cyclic cross of
Hendaye is a strange cross

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that sits in a churchyard
in Hendaye, France.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Hendaye, France, sits at the
southwest corner of France,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:10%
right across the
border from Spain.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
In the churchyard of
Saint Vincent's Cathedral

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
in Hendaye, France,
we find this strange

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
12-foot, obscure monument.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
The cross stands
about 12 feet high.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It has a pedestal that sits
about three and 1/2 feet high.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:84%
There are four carved drawings
on the facade of the pedestal.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:90%
There's a star on the east side.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
There's the fairy tale
moon on the north side.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:84%
There's the angry sun face,
with four six-pointed stars

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
on the west side.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the odd oval shape

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
with a cross in the center,
with an odd looking A

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:90%
in each of the quadrants.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the
odd-looking A has

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
the right angle crossbar, as
opposed to a straight crossbar.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
This is interesting, as it is
the symbol for freemasonry,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and may be why Fulcanelli
tells us in the chapter

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that the person who carved
the cross of Hendaye

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:90%
was a Master Mason.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Sitting on top of the pedestal
is a six-foot Greek column

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:90%
with 17 flutes.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And on top of the Greek
column is a Greek cross.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:84%
On the east side of the Greek
cross are the famous letters

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that were above Jesus
as he was on the cross--

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I-N-R-I-- which, in Latin,
means Jesus of Nazareth,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:90%
King of the Jews.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side is a Latin
inscription, pictured here.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
This inscription, although
broken as it reads, and we'll

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:84%
get into that later,
says, basically, in Latin,

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:90%
"Hail, O Cross, the only hope."

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's the cross of
Hendaye, not elegant enough

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to be moved to the Louvre,
or the British Museum,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
or the Metropolitan
Museum in New York.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So it sits here facing
the erosion of the sea,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:90%
and the cars rolling right by.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I predict the cross of
Hendaye will be completely

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:90%
eroded in less than 50 years.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
On the second page of his
chapter "The Cyclic Cross

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of Hendaye," Fulcanelli
tells us this

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
about the cross of Hendaye.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
"Whatever its age,
the Hendaye cross

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
shows by the decoration
of its pedestal

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that it is the
strangest monument

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of primitive
millenarism, the rarest

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
symbolical translation
of chiliasm,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:90%
which I have ever met."

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
To have someone with the
knowledge of Fulcanelli

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
telling us that this cross is
the rarest symbolic translation

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient Gnostic
tradition called chiliasm,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:90%
is extremely important.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Chiliasm is a Gnostic
doctrine concerned

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:90%
with the end of the world.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli is telling us
that this cross at Hendaye

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
is the rarest form of symbolical
meaning about our world

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
that he has ever seen.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was enough
to make me concentrate

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:90%
on the cross of Hendaye.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli clearly
ignores many of the things

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
on the cross of Hendaye, and
concentrates his attention

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:90%
to certain aspects of the cross.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
At first, I couldn't
understand this.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized later that
what Fulcanelli was doing

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
was forcing the curious reader,
the reader who was paying

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
close attention to
what he was saying,

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to go out and look
at the other things

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that he does not
mention on the cross,

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and understand what they mean.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And then come back
to him, and look

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
at what he is saying
about the cross,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and the particular aspects
that he points out.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the combination
of these two streams

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge gathering
have the tendency

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:90%
to initiate the reader.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a quite clever
way of getting the reader

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
think, which is one

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of the main purposes of
"Mystery of the Cathedrals,"

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and of alchemy.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the very first things
that he concentrates on

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
is the strange Latin inscription
that says, essentially,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
or ostensibly, "Hail, O
Cross, the only hope."

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
SHARRON ROSE: "Certainly it
is easy to recognize the well

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
known phrase, "O crux
ave spes unica"--

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Hail, O Cross, the only hope.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
However, if we were to
translate it like a schoolboy,

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:84%
we should not know the
purpose either of the base

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
or of the cross, and
we might be surprised

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:90%
by such an invocation.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
In reality, we should carry
carelessness and ignorance

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
to the pitch of disregarding
the elementary rules of grammar.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
"The masculine word 'pes'
in the nominative requires

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
the adjective 'unicus,'
agreeing in gender,

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and not the feminine form
'unica.' It would, therefore,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.655 align:middle line:84%
appear that the corruption
of the word 'spes'-- hope--

00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
into 'pes'-- foot-- by
dropping the initial consonant,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
must be the unintentional
result of a complete

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
lack of knowledge on the
part of our stone cutter.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But does inexperience really
justify such uncouthness?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:90%
"I cannot think so.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, a comparison
of the other motifs

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:84%
carried out by the same
hand, and in the same manner,

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
shows evident care to reproduce
the normal positioning--

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.100 align:middle line:84%
a care shown both in the
placing and in the balance

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:90%
of the motifs.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Why should the inscription have
been treated less scrupulously?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
A careful examination
of the latter

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:84%
shows that the letters
are clear, if not elegant,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and do not overlap.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
"No doubt our workman
traced them first

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in chalk or charcoal,
and this rough draft

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:84%
must rule out any
idea that a mistake

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:84%
occurred during the actual
cutting of the letters.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
However, since his
apparent mistake exists,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
it follows that it must
really have been intended.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
that I can think of

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
is that it is a sign
put it on purpose,

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
concealed under the appearance
of an inexplicable blunder,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and intended to arouse the
curiosity of the observer.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
"I will, therefore, state
that, in my opinion,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
it was with knowledge and
intent that the author

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
arranged the inscription of
his puzzling work in this way."

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER (VOICEOVER): What
Fulcanelli is telling us here

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the stone
cutter, the person

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:35.150 align:middle line:84%
who carved the inscription, the
Latin inscription on the cross,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:90%
made a mistake.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And this mistake would
be like carving the words

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:90%
"The United States" in stone.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The mistake would be taking the
D off of the end of "United,"

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.692 align:middle line:84%
and placing it at the
beginning of "States."

00:14:48.692 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
A completely ridiculous
mistake, and utterly untenable.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And Fulcanelli shows
us that it would

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
be impossible for
the stone cutter

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
to have drawn out the letters
and spent the hours doing that,

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and then spent the
hours cutting the stone

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
without ever knowing that he
was making this big mistake.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And as Fulcanelli says,
this was a mistake

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that was put here on purpose,
to alert the curious observer.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
SHARRON ROSE: "The letter S,
which takes on the curving

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
shape of a snake,
corresponds to the Greek chi,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and takes over its
esoteric meaning.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the helicoidal
track of the sun,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
having arrived at the
zenith of its curve

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:84%
across space at the time
of the cyclic catastrophe.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a theoretical image of
the beast of the apocalypse.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Of the dragon which, on
the days of judgment,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.654 align:middle line:84%
spews out fire and brimstone
on Macrocosmic creation."

00:15:44.654 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER
(VOICEOVER): Fulcanelli

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
then goes on to tell us
that he has translated

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:90%
the Latin inscription.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
By reading the
inscription in French

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and taking each of the syllables
and using them as a word,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Fulcanelli comes up with this.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
SHARRON ROSE: "It is written
that life takes refuge

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
in a single space, and we learn
that a country exists where

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
death cannot reach
man at the terrible

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:90%
time of the double cataclysm.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
As for the geographical
location of this promised land

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:84%
from which the
elite will take part

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.204 align:middle line:84%
in the return of the golden
age, it is up to us to find it."

00:16:20.204 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER
(VOICEOVER): Fulcanelli

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is saying here is that, while
he can translate the syllables

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
over to French and have it read
"it is written that life takes

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
refuge in a single space," he
is also telling us that there's

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:90%
more to the inscription.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:84%
That the inscription
is naming a country--

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
a country where the double
cataclysm, as Fulcanelli

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:90%
calls it, will not reach.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli gives us a
prescription for how

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:90%
to break the Latin inscription.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
As we will find out
later in this journey,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I use Fulcanelli's
prescription in this chapter

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to break the code of
the Latin inscription

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and reveal that, indeed, it
is talking about a country,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and a place, where the double
catastrophe will not reach.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
After the inscription
part in the chapter,

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli then
tells us about fixing

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the pole of the
northern hemisphere,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
and locating in time the
fatal period of the expiation.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:90%
He tells us that--

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
SHARRON ROSE: "It is this
which explains the inscription

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I-N-R-I-- Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews--

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
but which gives to the
cross its secret meaning.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Igne Natura Renovatur Integra.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
By fire, nature
is renewed whole.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
For it is by fire, and in
fire, that our hemisphere

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:90%
will soon be tried.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And just as, by means of
fire, gold is separated

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
from impure metals,
so scripture says

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the good will be
separated from the wicked

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.667 align:middle line:90%
on the great Day of Judgment."

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER (VOICEOVER):
Fulcanelli is telling us

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that there's going to be
an end of the world, a Day

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of Judgment, when the wicked
are separated from the good,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and the impure metals are
separated from the pure metals.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And this will be done by fire.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
While skipping over the pedestal
and its drawings of the sun,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
the moon, and the
star, Fulcanelli then

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
concentrates his chapter on the
oval with the strange four A's.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
He tells us that it is
a complete hieroglyph

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
of the universe composed of the
conventional signs for Heaven

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and Earth-- the spiritual,
the temporal, the macrocosm,

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and the microcosm, in
which major emblems

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
of the redemption cross
and the world circle

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:90%
are found in association.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
SHARRON ROSE: "'And before the
throne,' writes Saint John,

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
'there was a sea of
glass like unto crystal.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the midst of the throne,
and round about the throne,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:84%
were four beasts full of
eyes before and behind.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And the first beast
was like a lion.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And the second
beast like a calf.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And the third beast
had the face as a man.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth beast was
like a flying eagle.'

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
"This agrees with
Ezekiel's version.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
'And I looked, and behold,
a great cloud and a fire

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:90%
enfolding itself.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And the brightness was about it.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And out of the midst thereof,
as the color of amber,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:84%
out of the midst of the fire,
also out of the midst thereof,

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
came the likeness of
four living creatures.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
As for the likeness
of their faces,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
they four had the face of a
man, and the face of a lion

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:90%
on the right side.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And they four had the face
of an ox on the left side.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They four also had the face of
an eagle.' In Hindu mythology,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
the four equal sectors
of the circle formed

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
by the cross were
the basis of a rather

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:90%
strange mystical conception."

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER (VOICEOVER): He then
finishes his chapter with this.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:84%
SHARRON ROSE: "The age
of iron has no other seal

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
than that of death.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Its hieroglyph is the skeleton,
bearing the attributes

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of Saturn-- empty hourglass,
symbol of time run out,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and the scythe,
reproduced in the figure

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
seven, which is the number of
transformation, of destruction,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
of annihilation.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
The gospel of this
fatal age is the one

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
written under the
inspiration of Saint Matthew.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the gospel
according to science.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The last of all, but for us
the first, because it teaches

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
us that, save for a small
number of the elite,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:90%
we must all perish.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:10%
"For this reason the angel was
made the attribute of Saint

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:10%
Matthew, because science, which
alone is capable of penetrating

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:10%
the mystery of things, of
beings and their destiny,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.950 align:middle line:10%
can give man wings to raise
him to knowledge of the highest

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.604 align:middle line:10%
truths, and finally, to God."

00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
JAY WEIDNER
(VOICEOVER): Fulcanelli

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:84%
ends the chapter "The
Cyclic Cross at Hendaye"

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
telling us that the
age of iron will end.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And that somehow, the gospel
of science, which he attributes

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to Saint Matthew, is
how we can understand

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:90%
the progression of cycles.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is interesting that
Matthew has the words "Matth"

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, and I believe
that Fulcanelli is pointing us

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
towards the science of numbers,
the science of mathematics,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and telling us that through
the science of mathematics,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:84%
we can understand the nature
of the double catastrophe,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and the cycles of time.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things that
I discovered about this time,

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
in my research of
the cross of Hendaye,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
was the strange coincidence
of the panels on the pedestal

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and their relationship to the
tarot cards-- in particular,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:90%
four tarot cards.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Number 17 in the tarot
deck is the star.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And as shown here,
you can see that it's

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
an eight-pointed star, just
like the one at Hendaye.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Number 18 of the tarot
deck is the moon.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, just like at
Hendaye, we see a side profile

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:90%
view of a fairy tale-type moon.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.370 align:middle line:10%
Number 19-- again, notice
we're in succession-- 17, 18,

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.400 align:middle line:10%
19-- number 19 of the
tarot deck is the sun.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:10%
And again, notice the
sun face in this picture.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And notice there are 16
rays coming out of the sun,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:10%
just like there are 16 rays
coming out of the sun face

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:10%
in the cross of Hendaye.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.230 align:middle line:10%
Number 20 is the
Day of Judgment.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:10%
We see that the angel in the Day
of Judgment is holding a cross

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:10%
very similar to the
crossbar that is

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:10%
inside the oval with
the quadrants containing

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.070 align:middle line:10%
the four strange A's.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that there's
this odd relationship

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:84%
between the pedestal
of the cross of Hendaye

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and these four cards
of the tarot deck.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly enough, one of
the terms that Fulcanelli uses

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:10%
to describe the four
A's is that they have

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:10%
to do with the Day of Judgment.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:10%
Of course the Day of
Judgment is the fourth card,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:10%
and this is what the cross
of Hendaye is talking about.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Also, the two X's over the
Latin inscription on the cross

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:90%
above are for the number 20.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli definitely,
in the chapter,

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
says that there's a
relationship between the two

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:84%
X's and the odd
pedestal facade with

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:90%
the oval with the four A's.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So we can rest assured that the
fourth side of the pedestal,

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
the side with the
four A's, is pointing

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:90%
towards the Day of Judgment.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Four cycles of the Yugas, the
Golden Age, the Silver Age,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the Bronze Age,
and the Iron Age,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
culminate in a Day of
Judgment-- the end of the world.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:90%
A catastrophe.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The Iron Age has no other
hieroglyph than that of death.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Now that I had discovered
the tarot relationship

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
to the pictures on the
facade of the pedestal,

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I moved up the column
towards the Greek cross

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:90%
that sat at the top.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
On one side of the Greek
column are the letters I-N-R-I.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
These letters stand for
the Latin inscription Jesus

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:90%
of Nazareth, King of the Jews.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But they also stand
for the Latin term

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
which means, in fire,
nature is renewed whole.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
If one transliterated
the letters I-N-R-I

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:84%
into their Hebrew equivalents,
and then did a cabalistic

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.490 align:middle line:84%
analysis of those
letters, we'd find

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:90%
something very interesting.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
The four Hebrew words which
are associated with I-N-R-I,

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I is yod, N is nun, R is
resh, and I is yod again.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The numerical equivalents
of those Hebrew letters

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:84%
are, yod is 10, nun is 50, resh
is 200, and yod is 10 again.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.995 align:middle line:84%
When I added those up,
they added up to 270.

00:24:38.995 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I was
beginning to wonder about with

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli's writings on
the cyclic cross of Hendaye

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and what he was saying
about the cycles was,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to me that it was
very likely that the oval with

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
the four A's was really talking
about the 26,000-year long

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:90%
procession of the equinoxes.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
This is divided
up by astrologists

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
into 12 signs, or 12
months, of the great year.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Each of these 12
months is 2,160 years.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.568 align:middle line:90%
270 times eight equals 2,160.

00:25:17.568 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Eight is a predominant number
within the architecture

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and motifs of the
cross of Hendaye.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:90%
270 is a processional number.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Of course that
begs the question,

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:84%
what is the procession
of the equinoxes?

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to most people,
the stars are not fixed.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
While it might appear
that the same stars

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.210 align:middle line:84%
rise at the same time every
year, this is actually not so.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:84%
The earth revolves
around the sun,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:84%
but its vertical axis is
not straight north-south.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is tilted
at 23 and 1/2 degrees.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
This tilt is what
causes our seasons.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Just like a top wobbling
on the floor after it

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:84%
begins to lose its
momentum as it spins,

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:90%
the earth also has a wobble.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:10%
And this wobble
takes 26,000 years--

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:10%
or actually 25,920
years-- for it

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:10%
to go around once in the wobble.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
This wobble is also
backwards, against the motion

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:90%
of the night sky.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:90%
So the stars are not fixed.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And this was a great secret
to the esoteric scientists

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient world
in Egypt and Greece,

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:10%
and the alchemists of Europe.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:84%
For in this idea that the
stars were moving very slowly

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and the equinoxes were
passing through each sign

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
of the zodiac, taking
2,160 years to pass

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
through each
zodiacal month, they

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand that
there were great changes here

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the Earth as
the great zodiacal clock moved.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so if we started our
zodiacal clock at 12,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and that was Aquarius, then
each one, two, three, four,

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
all the segments on
our clock would be each

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:90%
of the 12 signs of the zodiac.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%
If we were starting at 12
o'clock, and that was Aquarius,

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
3 o'clock would be Taurus,
6 o'clock would be Leo,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
and 9 o'clock would be Scorpio.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.715 align:middle line:84%
These are the four great signs
in the vision of Ezekiel,

00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
and in John's apocalypse.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The four great signs--
the bull, the eagle,

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
which is Scorpio, the
lion, which is Leo,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and the human,
which is Aquarius--

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:90%
the man, or the water carrier.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So the ancients placed
great significance

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:90%
on these four quadrants.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And they seemed to point
out that when we pass

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
through the time period of
one of these four quadrants,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the changes here on the
Earth were much more

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:90%
severe than in other times.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, when we look back 13,000
years ago at the age of Leo,

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
according to this time clock,
we see the great extinctions

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:90%
of the woolly mammoth.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We see incredible
climatic changes.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
When we look 6,500 years ago
at the age of Taurus, again,

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:90%
we see great changes.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:90%
We see walled cities.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:10%
We see the city-states
first rising

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:10%
up across Sumeria, and Northern
Africa, and in the Middle East.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:10%
There does seem to be some
historical linkage to this idea

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.390 align:middle line:10%
that there were great
changes every time

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:10%
that the great processional
clock passes through one

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:10%
of these four quadrants.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're doing today.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We're passing through the
quadrant of Aquarius, which

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:90%
is one of the four quadrants.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli seems
to be telling us

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that the four ages
of the Yuga system,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and the four ages of alchemical
chronological time keeping,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:84%
are really based on this
idea of the procession

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the many things
that bothered me in 1994,

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
as the research continued, was
Fulcanelli's enigmatic phrase

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:84%
from the chapter on Hendaye--
the double catastrophe.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Fulcanelli refers to
a double catastrophe

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:90%
repeatedly in the chapter.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I still, to
that day in 1994,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
did not understand what he
meant by double catastrophe.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.101 align:middle line:90%
[WIND BLOWS]

00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I had discovered many
things about the other parts

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:90%
of the cross.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.430 align:middle line:84%
The Latin inscription had
completely bedeviled me.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew that Fulcanelli was
telling us that it described

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
a country, or a place
of refuge, where

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
man could go at the time of
the terrible double cataclysm.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea why the
workman who made the cross, why

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
he would take the S
from the bottom line

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and move it to the
top line, creating

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.285 align:middle line:84%
this jarring change
in the sentence, Hail,

00:29:44.285 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:90%
O Cross, the only hope.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Not really understanding what
to do after spending many hours

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.250 align:middle line:84%
working on it, I finally
drew the inscription out

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:84%
on a piece of paper and
carried it around with me.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I would open up the
paper and I would

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.130 align:middle line:84%
look at it in various
times when I was waiting,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.810 align:middle line:90%
and just stare at it.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.360 align:middle line:84%
One day, as I was
waiting for someone,

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I laid the paper out
on the seat of my car,

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:90%
and I began staring at it.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
As I stared at it, I
realized that the central X

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
in the top word could be a
symbol for the cross itself.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I separated the X from
the surrounding words,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and I came up with
four words, as you

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.540 align:middle line:90%
can see here in this diagram.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Split in this pattern, the
inscription looks like this.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:84%
From Fulcanelli's clues, we
know that the next step involves

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:84%
exchanging K's, or a hard C
sound, for S. Our inscription

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:90%
now looks like this.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:84%
This is not much better,
but we are making progress.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to
reciprocate the transformation,

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and turn the X into an S.
Now we have a simple anagram.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Exchanging the R and the C
on the left side of the S,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and rearranging the right
side with a few simple

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.650 align:middle line:90%
transpositions, and we have--

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Then finally, I did the same
transposition of the top word

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
on the left side,
including the extra S,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and the meaning becomes clearer.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:19.490 align:middle line:84%
The four words spell out
Cusco, Peru, Cave, Inca.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Or Inca, Cave, Cusco, Peru.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is clear and
simple in several languages,

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:90%
but there was another message.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.370 align:middle line:84%
When I uncovered this first
message that said Inca, Cave,

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Cusco, Peru, I went back
into the Latin inscription

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.970 align:middle line:90%
with renewed vigor.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I remembered that Fulcanelli
had talked about a single space.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:84%
A country being named where
life could find refuge.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
in this inscription

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd found a country, Peru,
and it had been named.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
What I did next was, I took
the top word, Ocruxaves,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and I displaced the S, according
to Fulcanelli's prescription.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I put the S at the
beginning of the word.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.300 align:middle line:90%
So now it read like this.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have three words read
outward from the central cross.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The first word is Ave. The
second word is the X, or cross.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And the third word
must be read backwards.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So instead of Socru, the
word now reads as Urcos.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The line now looks like
this-- Ave X Urcos.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Or, translating the Latin,
Hail (to the cross at) Urcos.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
At first I didn't
understand what this meant.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I looked up Urcos, and
could find no reference

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:90%
to it in the dictionary.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.970 align:middle line:10%
I then looked up the word
Urcos in my world atlas,

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:10%
and found that,
unbelievable as it

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:10%
may sound, 20 miles
away from Cusco, Peru,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:10%
is a town called Urcos.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Stunned by this
revelation, I realized

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that I had actually uncovered
the truth of the inscription.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It matched exactly
Fulcanelli's description

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of what the
inscription should say,

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'd followed
his prescription

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:84%
exactly, with the displaced
S and the hard C sounds.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I began a
massive research effort

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:90%
into the history of Peru.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Seattle
Public Library

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and checked out every book they
had on the history of Peru,

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and began reading everything
I could about Peru.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
That in itself is a
fascinating story.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things I
found-- I read the chronicle

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:90%
of Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the
men who had traveled

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:84%
with Pizarro on the first
expeditions to Peru from Spain.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Ayala had a drawing, and this
was the secret of the Incas.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see
from this drawing,

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:84%
there is the sun, looking
just like, or very similar to,

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:90%
the Hendaye sun.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a man in
a moon, looking

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
extremely close to the man in
the moon on the Hendaye cross.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
There is the star,
exploding outwards.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
the fourth one is

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:84%
an A-shaped hill, with the
words, "The caves at parati

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:90%
combo."

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:10%
I also learned at this
time, going through the Peru

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:11.380 align:middle line:10%
research, that there was this
incredible stories and legends

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:10%
about a tunnel system,
constructed by humans

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years ago, that ran
throughout the Andes Mountains.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
Pizarro believed these
rumors, and thought

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
that the Inca had
hidden tons of gold

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:90%
inside these caves and tunnels.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I was stunned by these rumors,
and believed that, if they were

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
true, these tunnels systems
could have been built

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:84%
by an ancient race to
hide from some kind

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of double catastrophe, of which
I still do not understand.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Once I broke the
Latin inscription,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.679 align:middle line:84%
everything else
followed quickly.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The struggle to understand
the cross of Hendaye

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:90%
began to become easier.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.315 align:middle line:84%
Once I showed the breakdown
of the Latin inscription

00:34:51.315 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and what it meant,
and how closely

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
it followed Fulcanelli's
prescription in the chapter,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:84%
people became excited,
and encouraged

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:90%
me to go on with my work.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of 1996, I met
a man named Nick Fiorenza.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:84%
He had just written a
paper called "The Erection

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Cross."

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
He asked me to read
the article, and I did.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, I
realized that Nick

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and several other
astrologers had

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
solved one of the major puzzles
of the cross of Hendaye.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.970 align:middle line:84%
What Nick and these other
astrologers had discovered,

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:32.270 align:middle line:84%
the line of the galactic access,
the Scorpio to Taurus line,

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:84%
would be at right
angles to the line

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.330 align:middle line:84%
of the procession of
the equinoxes, which

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:90%
are the Aquarius-Leo line.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
They also discovered
that this cross only

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:90%
happens every 13,000 years.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So the last time the great cross
occurred was 13,000 years ago.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:84%
What I realized in 1996,
when Nick Fiorenza showed me

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:84%
his work, was that the
pedestal of the cross

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:84%
was the point of
view from the Earth.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.930 align:middle line:84%
The sun, the moon, the
star, and the four A's,

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.380 align:middle line:90%
this was the Earth.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the cross
was the great cross that

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
happens every 13,000
years, and that this

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
was the outer event, taking
place outside the solar system.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I knew what the
cross stood for.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I understood that it was
discussing a relationship

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
between the great
cross in the sky

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and what would happen in
our local solar system

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:32.600 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I also began to
understand at that time

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.410 align:middle line:84%
why Ezekiel, in
the Old Testament,

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
was speaking about
the four great signs,

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:90%
or symbols, of the zodiac.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
great cross appeared,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
this would be the time
of the great apocalypse,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:90%
the great double cataclysm.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
John, in Revelation,

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:90%
is also talking about.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And this may also be what
the return of the cross,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:84%
or the return of Jesus,
may be talking about.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe even
Jesus was possibly

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
warning of this
time in the future,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
necessary for men

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to begin preparing for
the end of this time.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.060 align:middle line:84%
This great cross in the sky
was going to be happening

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:90%
sometime in the future.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was 1996,
and the astrologers

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.420 align:middle line:84%
weren't sure when the great
cross was going to happen.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Some said 1999.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Some said 2001.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Some said 2004.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of slop
in the measurements,

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and no one could quite tell.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Besides, the distance in a
26,000-year cycle is so vast

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:90%
that 20 years is but a sliver.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, using ancient
manuscripts and symbols,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.150 align:middle line:84%
it is easy to see
why there might

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
be so much slop in all
of the measurements

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:90%
taken about the great cross.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Either way, none
of the astrologers

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:84%
could come up with
an exact time.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:84%
They came up with a season of
the great cross, which is what

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I prefer to refer to it as.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.540 align:middle line:84%
In February of 1997,
I had the great honor

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
of going to France with my
soon-to-be wife, Sharron Rose.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Together we explored
the cross at Hendaye.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:90%
I measured it.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I was extremely thankful
that it truly did exist.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.845 align:middle line:84%
Sharron and I also
visited the Black Madonnas

00:38:18.845 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:90%
at Le Puy and Toulouse.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.036 align:middle line:90%
We went to Chartres Cathedral.

00:38:23.036 --> 00:38:24.840 align:middle line:90%
We went to Notre Dame.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:10%
We used Fucanelli's book,
"Mystery of the Cathedrals,"

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.550 align:middle line:10%
as our guide.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:84%
In May of 1997, I hosted
the second "Awakening Gaia"

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.020 align:middle line:90%
conference in Boulder, Colorado.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the guests that I
invited to that conference

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:84%
was the author of "Beyond the
Big Bang," Dr. Paul LaViolette.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down in
my chair and began

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to watch Paul LaViolette's
lecture on his new book,

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:90%
"Earth Under Fire."

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.730 align:middle line:10%
By the time Dr. LaViolette
finished his lecture on "Earth

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.460 align:middle line:10%
Under Fire," I was
limp in my chair.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.240 align:middle line:10%
First, Dr. LaViolette
talked about how

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:10%
Sagittarius, the bowman,
and Scorpio, the scorpion,

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:10%
were both pointing at
the center of the galaxy.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.140 align:middle line:84%
How the ancients must have
built the signs this way

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to point at the
center of the galaxy.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, Sagittarius is
aiming his arrow right

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the galaxy.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. LaViolette then showed us
samples of ice core drillings

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that he had taken
from Greenland.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:84%
These ice cores are
used by scientists

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell
atmospheric conditions

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.490 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:84%
As the ice never
melts-- it builds up,

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:84%
year after year-- the
record stays intact.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.700 align:middle line:84%
What LaViolette found as he
looked down this deep ice core

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
drilling was that every
26,000 years or so,

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:90%
there was a layer of iridium.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:10%
What this meant was
that every 26,000

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.330 align:middle line:10%
years, iridium would blow
onto the surface of the Earth

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:10%
somehow.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Iridium is a very rare
material on Earth.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
iridium found in space,

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:90%
but very little found on Earth.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.720 align:middle line:10%
It's a very rare element.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:10%
LaViolette also found
rhodium in these deposits.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Rhodium is also a
deep space element.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:10%
This turned LaViolette
outwards, looking

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:10%
for the cause of these iridium
layers every 26,000 years.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.930 align:middle line:84%
What he discovered
was the very basis

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:84%
for understanding Fulcanelli's
enigmatic description,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:90%
the double catastrophe.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.040 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette looked
out into space,

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and being an astrophysicist,
he realized that there were

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
strange objects in
space called quasars,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:90%
now called Seyfert galaxies.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.950 align:middle line:84%
What Carl Seyfert had discovered
was that what had previously

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:41.730 align:middle line:84%
been known as quasars, which
were very bright spots of light

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
in the heavens, which
scientists referred

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to originally as white holes,
as opposed to black holes.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:84%
What Carl Seyfert did was,
he took photographic plates

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:84%
of these white
holes, or quasars,

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and, using photographic
techniques,

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:84%
he toned down the
light, so that he could

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.560 align:middle line:90%
look deep inside the quasars.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:84%
When he did, he saw the
arms of spiral galaxies.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.860 align:middle line:84%
This made Seyfert think that
it was the center of the galaxy

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:90%
that had actually exploded.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And the explosion was so bright,
so hot, and so extensive,

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.822 align:middle line:84%
that it actually
overwhelmed and it

00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:23.420 align:middle line:84%
encompassed the entire
spiral galaxy itself.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Seyfert then looked
out into space,

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and realized that 7%
to 12% of all galaxies

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.830 align:middle line:84%
are in the active stage
of a Seyfert explosion.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.930 align:middle line:84%
He realized that all
galaxies go through

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:84%
this cyclic transformation
of explosion and quiescence.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.890 align:middle line:84%
He realized that the
center of all galaxies

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.720 align:middle line:90%
explodes periodically.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.590 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette took this
work by Carl Seyfert

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and applied it to our
own Milky Way galaxy.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:58.325 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that possibly there had
been a past Seyfert explosion

00:41:58.325 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
from the center of our
own Milky Way galaxy,

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:84%
he realized that might be the
reason why the ancients had

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:84%
pointed the arrow of Sagittarius
and the tail of Scorpio

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.630 align:middle line:84%
directly at the
center of the galaxy.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Like the sting of a
scorpion, the galaxy

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:90%
stings us with its explosion.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.590 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette talks about the
explosion from the center

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, and
how it would look

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:90%
to us from our point of view.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
He describes it as a bright,
blue star in the night sky.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.480 align:middle line:84%
He points out that the Hopi
have a legend that a blue star

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.390 align:middle line:84%
appears at the end of time,
called Saquasohuh, or the Blue

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Kachina, is a blue star
that shines in the sky,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and heralds the
end of the world.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.230 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette points out that
if the center of the galaxy

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:55.460 align:middle line:84%
exploded, the synchrotron
radiation spewing forth

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
the galaxy would

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:01.390 align:middle line:90%
turn the light to a blue color.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So the center of the galaxy,
in its explosive state,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:84%
would appear as a very
bright blue star in the sky,

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.705 align:middle line:84%
matching the Hopi
prophecies completely.

00:43:11.705 --> 00:43:16.070 align:middle line:84%
What LaViolette says is that
after the initial explosion

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of the center of the galaxy,
a massive wave flows outwards

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:27.390 align:middle line:84%
across the disk and the spiral
arms of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:84%
shoving blots of dust containing
iridium and rhodium outwards,

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:90%
towards the galactic edge.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Soon after we saw the blue
star, the pulse generated

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.210 align:middle line:90%
by the explosion would hit.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:84%
When it hit, it would
cause crustal torque.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Earthquakes.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.050 align:middle line:90%
High winds.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.490 align:middle line:90%
[LOW RUMBLING SOUND]

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometime after the pulse hits
would then come the dust.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.350 align:middle line:84%
This may take thousands
of years to hit.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:11.935 align:middle line:84%
But when the dust comes, it's
a huge cloud of cosmic dust--

00:44:11.935 --> 00:44:13.590 align:middle line:90%
of iridium and rhodium.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And when it enters
into the solar system,

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.000 align:middle line:90%
the moon will turn blood red.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Also, the dust will
begin to fall down,

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:84%
through the action of gravity,
onto the skin of the sun.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:32.140 align:middle line:84%
This will encase the
sun in the dust cloud.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Scientist call this
formation a T Tauri star.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:40.330 align:middle line:84%
What happens in a T Tauri star
is that so much cosmic dust

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.570 align:middle line:84%
falls on the skin, surface,
of a star or a sun,

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that it causes it to
heat up, like keeping

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:84%
your oven on too long without
the heat being able to escape.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Eventually it gets so hot
that it flares outwards,

00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and huge solar flares
bake all of the planets

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:02.240 align:middle line:90%
in the surrounding vicinity.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly enough, a NASA
scientist looking at flare

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:10%
tracings taken from moon
rocks during the NASA Apollo

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:17.200 align:middle line:10%
missions, and saw that the
last round of heavy activity

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.400 align:middle line:10%
occurred about 13,000 years ago.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.780 align:middle line:10%
13,000 years ago
is also, of course,

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.810 align:middle line:10%
the date for the
great extinctions

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:10%
of the woolly mammoths,
the giant tree

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:32.880 align:middle line:10%
sloths, the saber tooth tiger,
and thousands of other species.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.730 align:middle line:84%
This is in keeping with what
meteorologists have discovered

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:42.760 align:middle line:84%
about the weather 13,000 years
ago, in which they describe

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.230 align:middle line:84%
immense weather change, where
the temperatures of the Earth

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.340 align:middle line:84%
were suddenly raised and
suddenly lowered in a very,

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.360 align:middle line:90%
very quick period of time.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle line:84%
By the time the
lecture came to an end,

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:55.335 align:middle line:90%
I was completely stunned.

00:45:55.335 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette had described what
the star meant on the pedestal,

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and what the angry sun meant.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The star was the explosion
from the center of the galaxy,

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.610 align:middle line:90%
which looks like a blue star.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The sun was angry, because
the dust had enveloped it,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and its heat was increasing,
until it began exploding out,

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:84%
just like the rays
shown in this engraving

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.980 align:middle line:90%
on the pedestal of the cross.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I knew why the
Master Mason who

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
had built the cross of Hendaye
had placed the star opposite

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.270 align:middle line:90%
on the pedestal to the sun.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the center of
the galaxy was the sun

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:90%
behind the sun in occult lore.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It was the dark
sun of the occult.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:90%
It was the invisible sun.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.470 align:middle line:90%
It was the great dark goddess.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.380 align:middle line:90%
It was the Black Madonna.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It was Isis, the
mother of all things,

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.650 align:middle line:90%
who bore our son as her son.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:56.190 align:middle line:84%
In February 1998, I finally
did get to go to Peru.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Cusco, which sits at the
apex of a great cross

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.440 align:middle line:84%
according to the Incans, was
called the navel of the world.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Cusco itself is shaped
like a puma, which is

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.190 align:middle line:90%
a South American mountain lion.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.700 align:middle line:84%
At the very tip of
the nose of the puma,

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:84%
as you can see in
this drawing, you'll

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.290 align:middle line:84%
see that the caves
of Sacsayhuaman

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.360 align:middle line:84%
are at the very tip of
the nose of the puma.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.080 align:middle line:84%
When my Kitchwa guide
took me up into the caves

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.690 align:middle line:84%
near Sacsayhuaman, I
discovered vast caves,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.690 align:middle line:84%
some that had been sealed
over, like this one,

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.810 align:middle line:84%
by the Peruvian government,
to stop citizens

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:37.890 align:middle line:84%
from getting lost in the
vast complex that runs

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:39.470 align:middle line:90%
underneath the Andes Mountains.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Outside these caves, we
found heavily eroded effigies

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and sculptures of monkeys,
and pumas, and snakes,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.570 align:middle line:84%
as if the outside of the caves
had once been a ritual center.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was a
symbol of the happiness

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that the people felt
when they finally

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:02.180 align:middle line:84%
escaped the caves at the
end of the last catastrophe.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.850 align:middle line:84%
After discovering the
Inca caves in Cusco, Peru,

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I traveled southwards 20
miles, to the town of Urcos.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:13.960 align:middle line:84%
There, next to Lake Urcos, a
beautiful alpine mountain lake

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:84%
in the Andes, I discovered
on an ancient promontory,

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.380 align:middle line:90%
the cross of Urcos.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.820 align:middle line:84%
In perhaps the most
heartbreaking part

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of this research, I discovered
that the old cross of Urcos

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
had been broken, and
a new cross had been

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.090 align:middle line:90%
affixed to the old cross' base.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Not being able to follow
the trail any further

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:84%
after rediscovering
the cross of Urcos,

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to Tiahuanaco,
and the ruins just

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.430 align:middle line:84%
over the Bolivian
border from Peru.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I found this stonework all
over the Cusco-Tiahuanaco area

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.700 align:middle line:90%
of Peru and Bolivia.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:57.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the most astounding
amounts of stonework

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and ancient ruins are in Peru.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Only Egypt rivals Peru
for its ancient monuments.

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.840 align:middle line:10%
After getting back
from Peru in 1998,

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:10%
I received an advance copy of
the book "Maya Cosmogenesis

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:10%
2012," by John Major Jenkins.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.960 align:middle line:10%
John Major Jenkins
had discovered

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.460 align:middle line:10%
that the center of the
galaxy was rising helically

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:10%
on the winter solstice of 2012.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.510 align:middle line:84%
As I read John
Major Jenkins' book,

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the last piece
of the puzzle had been solved.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.750 align:middle line:84%
What Jenkins had found
was that the great Mayan

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:42.490 align:middle line:84%
calendar was going to run
out on December 21, 2012.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And that time would
come to an end.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And that this point
in time was marked

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:53.880 align:middle line:84%
by the simultaneous rising of
the morning sun and the center

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, in a direct
line with the Earth.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.990 align:middle line:90%
The marriage of Isis and Horus.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The great transmutative moment
would be in that second.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.130 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I knew in my
research that the Zep Tepi--

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:12.650 align:middle line:84%
which translates to "the first
time"-- of ancient Egypt,

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the construction of Shambala,
according to the Tibetans,

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.290 align:middle line:84%
the Day of Judgment,
according to the Christians

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and the Cabalists,
the end of time,

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.920 align:middle line:84%
according to the Mayan calendar,
and the great transformation

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.830 align:middle line:84%
of the human species, according
to the Peruvian shamans,

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.480 align:middle line:90%
were all the same event.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
going to happen

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.240 align:middle line:84%
within the time
period prescribed

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:90%
by the cross of Hendaye.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I no longer believe
that any particular date

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:90%
described that time period.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I believed it was more like
a season of the apocalypse.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The two X's on the cross
made me think that it must be

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.390 align:middle line:84%
a 20-year cycle
that ended in 2012

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and began in 1992--
strangely enough,

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.400 align:middle line:84%
right when my research
really started.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.040 align:middle line:84%
As I reached these
conclusions in 1998,

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure where to go with
them or what to do with them.

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I had decided to write a
book about the findings,

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:17.640 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't sure if the
findings were true or not.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was a
great cross in the sky,

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that the Latin
inscription indicated Peru.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the two X's were
talking about the equinoxes, as

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:90%
well as the number 20.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the pedestal was
talking about the tarot cards.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the star
and the sun were

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
describing a double cataclysm
of a galactic nature.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the
center of the galaxy

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.520 align:middle line:84%
was the dark goddess, the
black light of heaven,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the single most
important place in

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.700 align:middle line:90%
our local cosmic neighborhood.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the
inscription on the cross

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:57.210 align:middle line:84%
was telling me about Peru,
and that it would be a place

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to go when the time
of the great cross

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and the great double
cataclysm occurred.

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the Mayan
calendar was going to end.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But in 1998, these events
all seemed so far away

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.120 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't very concerned.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, I look back at
the last six years

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.440 align:middle line:10%
since my discoveries
finally culminated,

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.040 align:middle line:10%
and I realize several things.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.200 align:middle line:84%
One, that every
summer since 1992

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is hotter than
the summer before.

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:84%
That every summer since 1992 has
been the hottest summers ever

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:37.310 align:middle line:84%
recorded in the history
of weather keeping,

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:39.580 align:middle line:90%
which goes back some 500 years.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I realize that
the summer of 2003

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:84%
was the hottest
summer ever recorded

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:90%
in the northern hemisphere.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.820 align:middle line:10%
I remembered
Fulcanelli's admonition

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.340 align:middle line:10%
that the northern hemisphere
would be tried by fire.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.780 align:middle line:90%
That this age would end by fire.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.026 align:middle line:90%
[OTHERWORLDLY SOUNDS]

00:52:58.026 --> 00:53:14.340 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.390 align:middle line:84%
The ancient science of alchemy
is more extensive and all

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:20.070 align:middle line:84%
encompassing than just dealing
with the mystery of time,

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.050 align:middle line:90%
and the great cycle of the ages.

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But knowledge of time and
the turning of the four ages

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:26.500 align:middle line:84%
is essential to
understanding how

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.000 align:middle line:84%
human beings and other species
are created and changed.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.710 align:middle line:84%
What scientists call evolution
is really a cosmic process

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that involves much more
than just genetic mutation

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:38.300 align:middle line:90%
and spontaneous adaption.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Apparently the ages,
as they progress,

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.580 align:middle line:84%
cause huge changes here on
the surface of the Earth.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a very important
subject to the ancient science

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:48.750 align:middle line:90%
of philosophy and alchemy.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest
that evolution is

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:54.200 align:middle line:84%
much more complex than our
modern biologists believe.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the creation and
destruction of a species

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:84%
is governed by the marriage,
the alchemical union

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.540 align:middle line:84%
of both the forces of DNA and
the power of divine potential

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that exists in each
and every one of us.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps both are
equally important

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.920 align:middle line:90%
to this mysterious process.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.370 align:middle line:84%
This idea would go a long
way towards explaining

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.120 align:middle line:84%
the sudden leaps in
species development.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.270 align:middle line:84%
The forces from above,
from spirit, if you will,

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.930 align:middle line:84%
guided by the power
of light and time,

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:24.000 align:middle line:84%
help to sculpt and
paint the newly

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.270 align:middle line:90%
emerging species from below.

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Just as the genetic map helps
to create its physical form,

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.850 align:middle line:84%
so, too, does the spiritual
map help to create its soul,

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.520 align:middle line:90%
or divine essence.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.220 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists would
say that nature

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.160 align:middle line:90%
is much more than genetics.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps a higher,
more mysterious force

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that we are only beginning to
understand, also drives it.

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:48.390 align:middle line:84%
While ancient lore tells us
that the purpose of alchemy

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.450 align:middle line:84%
is to change lead
into gold, this

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.730 align:middle line:84%
is only a metaphor for
something far more important.

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The real point of the
perennial tradition

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.620 align:middle line:84%
is to take the lead
of the human body

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and convert it to the golden
luminescence of the spirit.

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Of the soul.

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:06.570 align:middle line:84%
The photons that exist
inside our very DNA

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.710 align:middle line:84%
may be the driving force
behind the alteration

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.360 align:middle line:90%
of our genetic structure.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.170 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen,
as time changes,

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:16.770 align:middle line:84%
the signs of the
zodiac also change.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, too, does the light
that reaches our eyes.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.040 align:middle line:84%
The quality of light
dictates the quality of time.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.624 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge was well
known to our ancestors,

00:55:25.624 --> 00:55:28.408 align:middle line:84%
and they lived as if their
lives depended upon it.

00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:30.264 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, it does.

00:55:30.264 --> 00:55:33.170 align:middle line:84%
The Cabalists tell us
that at the end of time

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:36.820 align:middle line:84%
there is what is known as the
cocoon, or the restoration

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.840 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Through the performance
of right action,

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.850 align:middle line:84%
holding to the truth,
integrity and compassion,

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:46.990 align:middle line:84%
each individual assists in
the great spiritual effort

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:49.750 align:middle line:84%
in which all opposites
are reunited,

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:90%
and perfection is restored.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:54.870 align:middle line:84%
The sacred sparks of the
divine, the angelic powers

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:57.870 align:middle line:84%
that have been weighted down
as the four ages progress,

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.780 align:middle line:84%
are released and reunited
with the divine source.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.600 align:middle line:84%
The paradise that was lost
to Adam and Eve is restored.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.085 align:middle line:84%
Humanity's exile from
the Garden is over,

00:56:07.085 --> 00:56:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and a state of harmony and
perfection returns again.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.810 align:middle line:10%
I would like to emphasize that
our entering the current age

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:17.620 align:middle line:10%
of Aquarius is really more of a
chronological marker than that

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.510 align:middle line:10%
of entering a new age.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.230 align:middle line:84%
However, over the
next few years,

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I would expect many
incredible and sudden changes

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to occur as we enter into this
new and unexplored territory.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.130 align:middle line:84%
What will happen,
no one can tell.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.340 align:middle line:84%
This program is really
just an introduction

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.490 align:middle line:90%
to the vast subject of alchemy.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.810 align:middle line:84%
In other programs,
I will detail many

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:41.230 align:middle line:84%
of the other amazing secrets
and mysteries of alchemy.

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:43.370 align:middle line:10%
I would like to
leave you with this.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical perennial
tradition is alive and well.

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Inside the esotery or
secret confines of Judaism,

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Christianity, Islam,
Buddhism, Hinduism,

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and most of the
indigenous traditions,

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:58.900 align:middle line:84%
lies the truth of
alchemy, and our coming

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.870 align:middle line:90%
spiritual transformation.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:03.170 align:middle line:84%
In other upcoming
programs, I will attempt

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to discuss and convey how
the processes of alchemy

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:09.150 align:middle line:84%
works to unveil the mysteries
of our very existence.

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:11.370 align:middle line:84%
How light can be
extracted from matter,

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:14.710 align:middle line:84%
like plants and minerals, and
how we can absorb this light

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and use it for our own
spiritual advancement.

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.220 align:middle line:84%
While we may be very
close to the end of time,

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.450 align:middle line:84%
we are not at the
end of our being.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:26.260 align:middle line:84%
For all of us are eternal,
born of a loving Creator,

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.400 align:middle line:84%
endowed with the
endless possibility

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.265 align:middle line:84%
for spiritual advancement,
whether in this world

00:57:31.265 --> 00:57:33.010 align:middle line:90%
or in another.
