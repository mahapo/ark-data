00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> There's someone there.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Just let him put down
his loading dock door.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.039 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:25.839 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Utterly perfect.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
This is all perfectly
good food that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have gone to waste.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
food waste program.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
could eat this food.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Best before the
17th of February.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:90%
That's today, in the garbage.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Outrageous.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I think of myself as
an accidental activist

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
because it was really all
about the quality of my life.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find my purpose.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Really, what I care
about most is making sure

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that hungry people
get surplus food,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and that it doesn't
go to landfill.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Globally, a third of all
food is going to waste.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly good.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Who wants some chicken?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We produce enough food for
all the people in the world.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have enough
food for everybody.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, doesn't make sense.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:90%
I've set myself a target.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Green gold.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally committed
to making sure

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that good food doesn't go to
waste anywhere in the world.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So first I want to fix
it here, and then we'll

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:90%
take it to the world.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Being a change maker involves
pissing some people off

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:90%
and ruffling many fins.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a little scary
to go out on a limb,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
but that is what
I'm going to have

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.272 align:middle line:90%
to win the fight going forward.

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a treasure trove, but
I have no idea where to begin.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Me at five or six.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Me and my mom in our
house in Johannesburg.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:84%
That's my childhood
sweetheart, Alan.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Me doing aerobics in the days
of Jane Fonda, shiny Lycra.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:90%
I looked so young.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.595 align:middle line:90%
My two beautiful sons.

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
This is from Edo
and Jo's wedding.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
My other son, Nadav,
and his wife, Jessie.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't know what this is.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I came here with no work
in 1988 and just started

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:90%
an events company.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I recall a $500,000
corporate event.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
When it ended,
all I did was just

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
take thousands of kilos
of food and dump it.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.408 align:middle line:84%
That was that beginning
of me thinking, wow.

00:04:03.408 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
There must be stacks
of food going to waste.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Now I seemingly had money.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:90%
It was empty.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
The guy that I was
living with, when I said,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm thinking
of starting a charity,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
he said, I don't
believe in charity.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I was completely

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.612 align:middle line:90%
living out of integrity.

00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So I dumped him, and
I thought, I'll just

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
go to South Africa
for a week and just

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:90%
think about what I am doing.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
It definitely was
guilt connected

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:90%
to leaving South Africa.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:90%
I left because of apartheid.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to stay.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't fight it
because I wasn't brave.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry that I didn't do that.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I contacted this old
beautiful family friend

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
of ours, Dr. Selma Browde,
who was an activist

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:90%
during the apartheid era.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And she said, awesome.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:90%
You'll come with me to Soweto.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I'd never been to Soweto.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And as we drove in, Selma
turned round and said,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I was responsible for
electricity in Soweto.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:90%
I just went, whoa.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
The hairs on my arms
stood up, and I just

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
wondered what it could
feel like to know

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
if you have had an impact
on millions of people.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that was that light
bulb moment that said,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:90%
this is what I want to do.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I was committed to
coming back to Australia

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and to starting a food
rescue organization,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:90%
and I called it OzHarvest.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But I continued
running my business,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and in 2009 I won the Vodafone
World of Difference award.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.533 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
conditions of the award

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is you have to stop
the work that you're

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
doing in order to work full time
in the charity of your choice.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I decided it was
either now or never.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So I close the doors
of my business,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.845 align:middle line:84%
and that's when
this all happened.

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no space this week.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
This is today, so little
bits of white are free time.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's 5:00.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Now what?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got hedge.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like a game of-- not chess
so much, it's like a puzzle.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Until I had Marla, I wouldn't
get to an appointment on time.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a little
bit of yellow here,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:90%
but I like my pink.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I like my pink.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.526 align:middle line:90%
Tracy's not here.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> How many people we have?

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
At my last count,
it was 125 before I

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:90%
brought five new people in.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:90%
We've created a brand.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
We're bright, we're yellow,
we sexy, we're lovable.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So have you
donated to us before?

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> What I need to run our
business this coming year is

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:84%
$12 million, I've
been told yesterday.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> What's your location, please?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> $12 million.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I should not be
sleeping at night.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.345 align:middle line:84%
>> My nearest driver's
in Nairobi know.

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> The money's there.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:90%
I just have to find it.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't take
no for an answer.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I have an enormous
amount of cheek.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I have an enormous
amount of chutzpah,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use it to
the absolute n-th degree.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:08:01.839 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
So Steve, have I got everything?

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Okey-dokes.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Best part for me is not when
I'm sitting in the office.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
For me, being on the
ground is where it's at.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle line:84%
In the van today,
there is frozen meat,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
there are bread rolls,
there is fresh food,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and they will be delivered
that to a whole range of people

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
who kind of have fallen
through the cracks.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> On the cement,
not on the grass.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Right here in this country, 2
million people suffer from food

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:90%
insecurity.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, they're nice
pies and sausage rolls.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I hope that the
food helps a little.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It stops that pain in the
guts, that's for sure.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>> What we're left with after--

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

I want to fix things.

I'm a fix it person.

And to fix the problem, I'm
going to need government.

I've just gotten off the phone
with the minister's office.

He is a go tomorrow
at the launch.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:90%

Bye.

>> Why did I start OzHarvest
when it was a government issue?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:84%
For me, to see the gap and see
the government wasn't doing it,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I could either be pissed
off and do nothing,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
or I can be pissed off
and go into action.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
We are asking our
nation's leaders

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to set a target to minimize food
waste by at least 50% by 2025.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So every single thing
here, first of all,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:90%
has been a rescued.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:90%

Big one What a tragedy
that that would

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:84%
have ended up in a
landfill somewhere.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you get this food
out to those that most need it?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are 32 refrigerated
vehicles on the road with

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.898 align:middle line:84%

in safe food handling--

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Those vehicles will be
delivering this food

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:84%
to over 700 different charitable
organizations around Australia.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.933 align:middle line:90%

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:84%

been thrown out, Philip.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%

$10 billion food waste bill

I want to be involved

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> What day is that?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.342 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'd drive her crazy
because I say, no, fit it in.

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I can do this, this, and
this and this and this

and this and this.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%

This is the fifth year.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I was aiming for 1.5.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And we invite 1,000
homeless people,

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:90%
and we feed them with dignity.

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:36.930 align:middle line:84%
made a few bad
decisions, and here I am.

Putting on an event like
this is what I used to do,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
doing these kinds of events
that made me start OzHarvest.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Who wants a red carpet?

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We just want a yellow
carpet, a yellow

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
because yellow is the color
that makes the world go round.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Hello, my darling.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Immovable force,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
you can't say no to her.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
She has powered this thing
from one truck to 34.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I come back to this great
idea, taking fantastic

who are homeless and need it.

go back to them

00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line
is that they say

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
it's broken the chain of cold
storage, which is correct.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
From the time that it gets
out of the refrigeration

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
until such time as my
people would pick it up,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a good few hours, and
they can't take that risk.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
be held liable, even

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
though they are not liable.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Civil Liabilities
Amendment Act

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.027 align:middle line:90%
removes the liability from them.

talk about some kind of tax

I know that there's so much
food wasted in the supermarkets,

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
but I know that there's food
on the farms that doesn't even

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:90%
make it to the supermarkets.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's about fact
finding and hopefully not

shock finding.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
In terms of gross food
waste, we are up there

with the biggest offenders.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%

bad enough that $10 billion

to waste right here.

they wouldn't be

beautiful lemon and better

off there, for example,

Do you have waste?

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we have a lot of
waste, sometimes up to 30%

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:90%
of the crop.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So these bananas are
going into the bin,

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and they'll get pulped.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Just because they've
got a blemish on them?

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> They're perfectly edible,
but we have to waste them

because the supermarkets
won't accept them.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.208 align:middle line:84%
So this is our scrap bananas,
and we put them in the truck

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and take them back
out to the paddock

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and dump them out
in the paddock.

>> Doesn't this
break your heart?

00:20:13.022 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a real shame
because a lot of love goes

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:90%
into growing it.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
The specifications for
what we need to grow,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:90%
they've got a lot tighter.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And that just creates
an expectation

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:84%
of the perfect looking
fruit all the time,

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.726 align:middle line:84%
which just means
we throw more out.

00:20:28.726 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's ridiculous.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that
someone has grown that food,

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's taken water
and fuel and energy.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Then to reject it is inhumane.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I was just in
Northern Queensland,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and I saw farmers who
were throwing away

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
produce because the lemons
were too big, too small.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, who decides
the specifications

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that this is Odd Bunch and
that over there is perfect?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So our specifications
a customer led.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have customers
that walk into our stores

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.145 align:middle line:90%
and expect the best of the best.

00:21:22.145 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, there
is a growing trend

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
with reducing food
waste, and customers

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:84%
are becoming more susceptible
to a little bit of marking.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> External.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, external,
purely external.

00:21:31.038 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The inner quality
is still the same.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I nearly died at the
banana plantation

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
because a third got
discarded, and you're

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:90%
saying it's consumer led.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So we need to talk
with our feet and say,

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
we'll come to this
part of the supermarket

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and not to the other part.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Currently, the Odd Bunch
represents under 1%

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:90%
of the total department sales.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Our short-term goal
is to get it to 10%.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.093 align:middle line:84%
>> And my goal is
50% as soon as.

00:22:05.093 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll have to look
at that challenge.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> They look nice and frickly.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:90%

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:90%
This was $75.70.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Research says that one in
five shopping bags get thrown

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to assume
that out of my $75 shop,

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
if I weren't aware, a lot
of that would go to waste,

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.675 align:middle line:84%
and some of that
would go to landfill.

00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:40.649 align:middle line:90%
Outrageous.

00:22:40.649 --> 00:22:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.885 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, this is shocking.

00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Every time we throw
away food, methane gas

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
is emitted into the climate.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So food waste is
a huge pollutant.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that if
food waste were a country,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
it would be the third biggest
emitter of methane gas.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea the environmental
impact we would have.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take very
long to realize

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that every single time that
we were collecting food,

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't going to landfill.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%

some dal, papaya, some milk.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could say
that I didn't waste.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But I live by myself,
so I make sure that

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:90%
can't buy too much food.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Now it's good to
go to the world.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
This poor little pepper
is five weeks old.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I bought it thinking
I was going to eat

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:90%
a salad that night, literally.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled to New York,
I've traveled to the world

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and back, and this
poor little pepper's

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:90%
still been in my fridge.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This is not going
to go to landfill.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
This is going to go into
my little composter.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.535 align:middle line:90%
It is time for you to go.

00:24:19.535 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
This is my precious
food waste bin

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that's changed my life because
now I don't have to put stuff

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:90%
in the garbage bin.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I put all my organic
food scraps and flowers

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:84%
into this little
bin, and I sprinkle

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:38.855 align:middle line:90%
special sawdust in between.

00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
This is like nutrient goodness
that comes out of all this.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Food doesn't go to landfill.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I go and bury that, and
it's composting the earth.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And the liquid
nurtures my new plants

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:90%
and also it cleans my drains.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done it
in the drains yet.

we've just experienced

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
because we lost my
daughter in law to cancer.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.015 align:middle line:90%
Just doesn't seem possible.

00:25:56.015 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't seem possible.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:84%
But we've been very
privileged and blessed

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to have for the seven years
that she came into our life.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%

her go through it and not being

the Premier's department.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're looking at
bringing a very important--

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:90%
they said very important people.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:90%
We were speculating.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Was Barack Obama coming to town?

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
It was all of those things.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Then they called
us to say, yes, we

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:84%
are bringing her Royal Highness,
the Duchess of Cornwall.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:90%
The big day is arriving.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We've just done a run-through
with some members of protocol

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in preparation for the
Duchess of York's visit.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Who would have thought--

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Cornwall.

00:27:06.985 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:90%

her Royal Highness or ma'am,

and that actually goes
for anyone, ma'am.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to thank Marla
because she has single-handedly

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:84%
managed security, the police,
the protocol, the Premier's

I hope that all of
you are incredibly

proud that you put your money
into such a good investment.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't have happened if
it wasn't-- and I was not going

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.695 align:middle line:90%
to cry because I'm so excited.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to take
you through and show you

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:84%
The food that they
make today will go out

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:90%
to our people for dinner.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So they get to
taste a teeny bit,

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
but the bulk of the
food they prepare

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.905 align:middle line:90%
will go out to our people.

00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:45.705 align:middle line:90%

Why do we need more laws?

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.336 align:middle line:84%
I think that are much
better ways of tackling it.

>> You're very good
at MCing, though.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.322 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.322 --> 00:32:23.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:32:23.122 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, sorry, sorry, everyone.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Ronni.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a little bit of
dialogue around Woolworths,

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:36.150 align:middle line:84%
maybe an update, Ronni, on what
is basically one of our most

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.278 align:middle line:90%
important partnerships.

00:32:37.278 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So first of all, the
relationship with Woolworths is

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
plodding along really well.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It's frustrating.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
They talk about wanting
to minimize food waste.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We are their national
food partner.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, we went
with some dumpster divers

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and landed up behind
the Woolworths

00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:84%
in a dumpster that was
filled with magnificent food.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you can get
around the flashpoint,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:84%
now let's sit down and have
a proper conversation about,

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.860 align:middle line:90%
what do we do about this?

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> All they're worried
about is brand reputation.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And where they
are panicking is--

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.440 align:middle line:84%
well, where are they
doing the emotional screws

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is you are our
national food partner,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:90%
and you're about to screw us.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The bigger problem is
what's in the dumpster.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> We found it in a heartbeat.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.280 align:middle line:90%
What if it's counterfeit?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Plenty of other people
are going to find this

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:84%
in a heartbeat at some stage
over the next period of time.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
If your reputation is going
to be sullied by this,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:90%
so will ours.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Today, they see us as a risk.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:34.732 align:middle line:90%
They think I'm going to--

00:33:34.732 --> 00:33:35.532 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.532 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the objective
of your conversation is,

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
rid of this for you.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But we're here to be
part of the solution.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.101 align:middle line:90%
Is everyone cool with that?

00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:44.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, think so.

00:33:44.506 --> 00:33:45.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:33:45.306 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:51.912 align:middle line:84%
>> The Woolies discussion is a
real-life example of the sorts

00:33:51.912 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of things that we talk about.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Ronni is so passionate
about food rescue

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and helping those in
need that, really, you're

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:84%
either on that
bus or you're not.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And Ronni's bus is going
in 150 miles an hour.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so while some people
might be on the bus in theory,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:90%
they can't move at that pace.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that does sometimes
create some conflict.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.287 align:middle line:84%
>> As with anyone who has such
drive and such passion and such

00:34:18.287 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
a singular vision, there's going
to be a little bit of carnage

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.320 align:middle line:90%
on the way.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Ronni is not
everyone's cup of tea.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.675 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:26.675 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> As a result of
Camilla visiting us,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:84%
we've had the wonderful
chain of events.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they're very
keen for us to come to the UK.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what I'm
expecting I want you to come.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
Our major event, THE
CEO CookOff, took place.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I hear you.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:90%
We'll give you another one.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.784 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced to the CEO
of the Jamie Oliver Foundation.

00:34:51.784 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The CEO CookOff.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> They would very much like
us to produce a CEO CookOff

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:84%
in the UK together
with Jamie Oliver.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:90%
See you in heaven.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Shut the door.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be going
to meet with them,

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm also going to be
looking for a CEO for UkHarvest.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a very
spectacular night.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.600 align:middle line:84%
If you'd have asked me 12
years ago, not only would

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:84%
you start an
organization that'll

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
make a significant
difference to Australia--

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a
call for a pickup--

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> --but--

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Just send the job through.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> --actually across the
world, I would have said

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:90%
you're dreaming.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:84%
What we've done
is refined a model

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.686 align:middle line:84%
that is duplicable and
replicable around the world.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So right here in London I'm
meeting with Yvonne Thompson.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:05.000 align:middle line:84%
She is the CEO of the
newly fledgling UKHarvest,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and her job is to
bring it to life.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we had our first
conversation with me

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.528 align:middle line:84%
still in Sydney and
in the UK, I already

00:36:16.528 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
hired her over the phone.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Amanda, Camilla's right hand
person, is setting there.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:38.047 align:middle line:84%
And she invited two
more people to come in,

00:36:38.047 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and they just wanted to know
what they could do to help.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:90%
They love us to bits.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.960 align:middle line:90%
We are the most lucky people.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> To have the launch on the
same day as the CEO CookOff is

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:00.560 align:middle line:84%
just incredible because then
you get such a big bang in terms

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.370 align:middle line:90%
of publicity.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And she's agreed to
come to the CEO CookOff.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.485 align:middle line:90%


00:37:05.485 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's particularly
extraordinary because the food

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:84%
waste space in London's
very male dominated,

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
so I think the importance
is having women,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.970 align:middle line:84%
positive active women, who will
do good and deliver goodness.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Dear Yvonne, the
Duchess of Cornwall

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:84%
is delighted to take on
the patronage of UKHarvest.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:middle line:90%
This is a major fucking coup.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:90%


00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So right here I've got both
timezones happening in her

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.510 align:middle line:84%
schedule, so I can see
right now in London time.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Today, Ronni is
going to be meeting

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
with the head of the Jamie
Oliver Foundation, which

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:90%
is a really big deal.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Jamie is the most well-known
food icon in the world.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I've not been
allowed to talk to him yet,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and I am convinced that he's
being protected by his people.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm worried he doesn't
get the DNA, the soul,

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:90%
of our event.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to rock the
boat because I think, actually,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I've had to make a
compromise in terms of,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.748 align:middle line:84%
do I want the event with Jamie
for what that will do for us?

00:38:21.748 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the important thing
for us is to make sure that we

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:84%
have that partnership
together, and it's strong.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.845 align:middle line:84%
So the first time
we're doing it,

00:38:27.845 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
we've got Jamie
Oliver as a platform.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We do the event, we
make it successful,

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:90%
we plan the next one.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:90%
How does that sound?

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.260 align:middle line:90%
I just want to be clear.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear you tell
me who our guests are.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So I will be really honest--

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.810 align:middle line:90%
homeless people in London.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:49.815 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be problematic,
as in drugs alcohol problems.

00:38:49.815 --> 00:38:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I just change the
terminology from homeless

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to vulnerable because vulnerable
people are not all homeless?

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I get it.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Coming back up and
feeding it into Jamie,

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:84%
he said, I feel
uncomfortable turning up

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of my privileged
mates and privileged CEOs,

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.790 align:middle line:84%
almost like cooking
at those people.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> But the way it's sold is you
can break bread with somebody

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.460 align:middle line:84%
who you would never have
an opportunity to talk with

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.585 align:middle line:84%
because you walk past them,
and they're transparent

00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:90%
on the street.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.948 align:middle line:84%
But when they walk
through the door

00:39:17.948 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're sitting as guests,
you get an opportunity.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.475 align:middle line:84%
And that's the humbling
part for a CEO.

00:39:25.475 --> 00:39:27.933 align:middle line:84%
>> I said to him, well, OK, I
understand you're not feeling

00:39:27.933 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
good about the homeless and
the vulnerable side of things.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:90%
What about war vets?

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we got
to public servants,

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.610 align:middle line:84%

>> Can we talk about alcohol?

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Also comes from Jamie.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm not bringing
out my best mate CEOs

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.140 align:middle line:90%
and inviting them to a dry do.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, I feel
that's a bit mean.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not about meanness.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.953 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about
making a statement.

00:39:58.953 --> 00:40:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's you-- you
made that statement,

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.040 align:middle line:90%
which is obviously up to make.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not a statement
that Jamie would make.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, certainly, if we're
not having vulnerable people,

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.720 align:middle line:84%
then we have less of an
issue about having alcohol.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Ronni
doesn't compromise.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I think she's a woman
of massive principles.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Ronni Kahn is an
inspirational free spirit.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:90%
She's like a jack in the box.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:90%
The box opens, and she pops out.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And what people see that, they
either love it or loathe it.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I go to the
altar with anyone who

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:84%
doesn't understand
my core values?

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The reserved culture
of the UK, I think,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.683 align:middle line:90%
found it a bit too much.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, it is crazy.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is crazy.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
Paris Thursday night.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:84%
We're meeting Arash,
the councillor

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:90%
that changed the law.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
controversy around it,

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and so we also have meetings
with some of the charities.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's going to be awesome.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:90%

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:90%
the legal change in France.

>> Arugula salad?

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The decision makes France
the first country in the world

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to prohibit supermarkets
throwing away or destroying

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Bonjour.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Lovely to meet you.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> My country, 10
million persons hungry.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.370 align:middle line:90%
We cannot wait.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:90%
So you had to set a target.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We need action.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.210 align:middle line:90%
The next step is Europe.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, lots of countries.

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I want the same
thing in Australia.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So in Australia, the law
was first changed in Victoria

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:90%
in 2002.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2005, we
had the laws changed

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:84%
in another state, in
2008 in another state,

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:90%
in 2009 then another two states.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Our law says we will give you
food like a good Samaritan,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.220 align:middle line:90%
in good faith.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So the supermarkets
are not liable.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You are amazing diplomats.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure that you are.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I have to be.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I also have to be an activist.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We're both fighting
the same fight.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We've got the exact
same target, and we've

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.610 align:middle line:90%
got the exact same goal.

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a global--

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Movement.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> --movement for society.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess that the many parts--

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Which one?

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:90%
That's Hebrew.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Who offer you?

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Hebrew.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.020 align:middle line:90%
But who offer you that?

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So my daughter-in-law
just passed away.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.470 align:middle line:90%
She died, elle mourut.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Your daughter?

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> My-- yeah, oui,
mais, that's OK.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And a very special
person gave her this.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What was her name?

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Her name was Jo.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And it says on
it, God, please heal.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:90%
She was a beautiful--

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.784 align:middle line:90%

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd question the value of a
law that says supermarkets

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:90%
must give their food away.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd much rather
do what I've done,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:84%
which is form a partnership
with supermarkets

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that that
food that is available

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.180 align:middle line:90%
goes to feed people.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.456 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.456 --> 00:44:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Benjamin.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good, thanks.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:90%
So explain to me--

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> How it works.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --how it works here.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We try to help people,
to provide them food.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We try to make it as
a supermarket kind of,

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.460 align:middle line:90%
with shelves.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.425 align:middle line:84%
There is a system
of cash points.

00:44:22.425 --> 00:44:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So it works exactly
like a little shop.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.060 align:middle line:84%
When you first are
called me up to explain

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:84%
us the situation
of the family, you

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.830 align:middle line:84%
have to show evidence
that you really need food.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a really nice
piece of meat, you see.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And when does it must be used?

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Today.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> By today.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> But you and me both know--

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> --that if they
don't use it today,

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.047 align:middle line:90%
nothing will happen to them.

00:44:46.047 --> 00:44:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what the
volunteers also explain.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people in need that
do not need to prove to me why

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.025 align:middle line:90%
they're in need.

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm
standing there, I'm

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.410 align:middle line:84%
thinking I'm going to go to
my Woolworths people and say,

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:03.330 align:middle line:84%
what if you set me up in
a little mini supermarket.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And we collect all your
surplus and we set it up

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.770 align:middle line:90%
like a supermarket?

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:13.250 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It was hard getting
people to the table.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone believed
in what we were doing.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a year since
we were in Canberra.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, I want to announce a
national food waste strategy.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And nothing has happened,
which is why we're creating

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.950 align:middle line:84%
a Zero Food Waste Forum
and which is why we believe

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
a collaborative approach
is hugely important.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I've got Woolworths.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely no doubt
that OzHarvest by itself

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.230 align:middle line:84%
is not going to minimize all
the food waste in Australia.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We have pulled together
Woolworths, Aldi, Coles,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.430 align:middle line:84%
government, food
rescue organizations.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:84%
This has never happened
before, not in this format.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I've done this because
government hasn't.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.490 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the
Zero Food Waste Forum

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:84%
was to bring together
all the stakeholders

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.290 align:middle line:84%
so that collectively
we could look

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:84%
at how we can solve the
massive issue of food waste.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it was
said, no media.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of trust was
built despite the fact

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that there was so much
distrust when we all walked in.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Just that some people didn't
throw punches was amazing.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that nobody
punched anybody.

I might have a solution

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> $10 billion-- how can
people visualize what that is?

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first thing
that I did, really,

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.580 align:middle line:84%
was work out what $10 billion
worth of food waste looks like.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So I took the
average grocery bag,

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and we worked out there's
probably about $50.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So then you have
three bags, $150.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.702 align:middle line:84%
>> And this one here
is about $1,000.

00:47:47.702 --> 00:47:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is $100,000 worth.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's so clever.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It's powerful because we know
that one in five shopping bags

00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.170 align:middle line:90%
goes to waste.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what research has shown.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So this was where I came
to, which was Sydney Harbor.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Far out.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if that's the postcard,
that we started sending out

Who wants to come here?

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Apart from that
pile, can we have

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.450 align:middle line:84%
little bits floating in the
harbor so that it's really--

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:90%
this is too contained.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.460 align:middle line:90%
This is too nice.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.260 align:middle line:90%

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I want it to look so shocking
that you've got two things

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.610 align:middle line:90%
to be shocked by.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The one is the scale
and the enormity,

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.020 align:middle line:84%
but the other is actually how
we're treating out planet.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to take
a little clip of this,

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.250 align:middle line:84%
put it on social media,
get it out to the world

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:44.210 align:middle line:90%
to highlight the shock factor.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the last few weeks
working with government,

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.710 align:middle line:84%
they are talking about waste
in Australia being $20 billion

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:middle line:90%
a year, not $10.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's double that.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.628 align:middle line:84%
>> So $20 billion is
now what our minister

00:49:00.628 --> 00:49:02.170 align:middle line:84%
for the environment
is talking about.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:90%

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:05.020 align:middle line:90%

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.290 align:middle line:90%
How lovely to see you.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much, so
lovely to see you again,

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for
being our patron.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:12.960 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.830 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:14.930 align:middle line:90%
We brought yellow.

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> You brought
warmer conditions.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.030 align:middle line:90%
This is our UK CEO.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%

said, I'd love

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to see a version
of this in the UK.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I heard that, and I said,
we'll make it happen.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.905 align:middle line:84%
And now Her Royal
Highness is our patron.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> This charity is now up
and running in this country.

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Her Royal Highness
has shared with me

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that Prince Charles is
absolutely a waste warrior.

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.080 align:middle line:84%
She said, no food goes
to waste in their house.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.971 align:middle line:84%
It would be off with your
head if you wasted food.

I feel brilliant because I

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.900 align:middle line:90%
had a long talk to Jamie.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, how are you
feeling about the event?

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you
probably may or may not

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
know that in Australia
we feed 1,000

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
homeless and the hungry people.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, why aren't
we doing that here?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I just looked at him and
said, because your people--

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.830 align:middle line:90%
because you didn't agree to.

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%


01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for a first
year it's good energy.

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:05.810 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing turnout.

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's awesome energy.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
focus on the waste more

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.770 align:middle line:90%
because waste is the new black.

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think that there's
power in us doing stuff

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:17.610 align:middle line:90%
together.

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I guess we should
keep reminding ourselves

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.165 align:middle line:90%
that great change is happening.

01:05:21.165 --> 01:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
really nice is

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.860 align:middle line:84%
in the UK we're learning
from the success you've

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.660 align:middle line:90%
had in Aussie.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the world's
a small place now, right?

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%

>> It's from our major supplier.

I didn't sleep all night.

>> Yeah.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's our biggest partnership,
and that was at stake when you

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:10.840 align:middle line:90%
cause a problem for a partner.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I said, we've discovered
this dumpster by chance,

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but that was full of
beautiful food that

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have been there.

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was horrified,
but he said,

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
we working so hard with
OzHarvest to fix the problem,

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and that they're committed to
solving the problem with us.

for you and him to sit down,

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:34.430 align:middle line:90%
talk about it, get it out.

01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%

we have been donated to space.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We're doing Australia's first
free supermarket, giving away

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
produce that we
collect for free--

Pastries.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.931 align:middle line:84%

When we were in Paris, we
went into a free supermarket.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
People had to show their card
to show that they had no money,

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and that is exactly
what I don't want.

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some argument whether
this is the world's first,

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.333 align:middle line:84%
but it's most definitely
an Australia first,

01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:41.740 align:middle line:90%
this incredible market here.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's yet
another incredible showcase

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:49.479 align:middle line:84%
of the inspiration of Ronni
and the entire OzHarvest team.

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Can I please welcome our
fearless and occasionally

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.349 align:middle line:90%
fearsome leader, Ronni Khan.

>> Wow.

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It is an exciting moment,
a free supermarket.

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:05.300 align:middle line:90%
It is time to disrupt.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:09.189 align:middle line:84%

launch the OzHarvest

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.198 align:middle line:90%

where you can take what you

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.370 align:middle line:90%
need and give if you can.

>> She saw the need, and then
she just bulldozed her way

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
through to find the solution.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So we are all to blame.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as if she has, I think,
some kind of higher calling

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%

will not be defeated.

01:10:01.215 --> 01:10:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The federal government
has signal its commitment

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%

food the nation wastes by 2030.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Two years ago in mid 2015,
we actually got this initial

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.280 align:middle line:90%
commitment.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>> National Food Waste Strategy.

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We have been pushing and
shoving because nothing has

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.200 align:middle line:90%
come out of Canberra.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The government stuff
really does frustrate her.

01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
She cannot deal with
this bureaucracy.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> They have completely let us,
the people of Australia, down.

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> She feels like none of them
care enough to go at it at her

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.930 align:middle line:90%
sort of pace.

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I am absolutely sure that the
Zero Food Waste Forum is what

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
triggered the government into
action to delivering a national

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
food waste strategy
on November 20.

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:00.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't really know
what to do with me,

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
but they know that I am not
going to leave them alone.

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
They also know that
I have expertise

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and have been studying what's
happening around the world.

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So I've now been appointed
on to the Advisory Strategy

01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Committee.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And today, this meeting is
to say, we've lost two years

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.920 align:middle line:90%
and done nothing.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
You now have an opportunity
as the new minister

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
for the environment to actually
do something significant.

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:30.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:31.020 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much--

01:11:33.018 --> 01:11:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No, lovely to see you.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>> --for your time today.

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you so
much for taking a stand

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and committing publicly to
minimize food waste by 50%.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It is huge leadership, huge.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And committing to this summit
in November is fantastic.

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Now we just have to deliver.

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
exactly why we're here,

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
make it easy for you.

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that what we
have to share with you today

01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.510 align:middle line:90%
will be helpful.

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it's about.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that we waste
at least 20% of what we buy,

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
costing us $20 billion a year,
so much of this lands it ends

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
up in landfill, the CO2 impact,
the impact on the environment.

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.820 align:middle line:90%
We can do better.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:14.720 align:middle line:90%
We must do better.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So thank you for your time.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> No problem.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Shabbat Shalom.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>> You too.

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Shabbat Shalom.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.720 align:middle line:90%

Qantas has decided
to come to the party.

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We were only collecting
three days a week.

01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
We are now collecting
every day of the week.

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We have been donated a
van by Neil Perry, who is

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:39.220 align:middle line:90%
the chef ambassador for Qantas.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.260 align:middle line:90%
How much food are we collecting?

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say on average it'd
be close to 100 kilos a day,

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Monday to Friday.

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And among that produce, are
we getting any of the daily

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
yogurt that might
come off the trays?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Not from Qantas.

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%


01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Todd took a while to
get to this for how long?

01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We're now coming up to nearly
our second year anniversary.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So we first started
off in Sydney.

01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
We then looked to Brisbane,
to Melbourne, and then Perth.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.650 align:middle line:90%
So the program's now nationwide.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is awesome.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I love seeing the
apples, the dry goods.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But you know, for me,
where's the yogurt?

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Where's the milk?

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>> They're coming.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.920 align:middle line:90%
They're coming.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Where are the
cold chain things?

01:13:24.378 --> 01:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Because they're getting
dumped at the moment.

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> We're managing cold chain.

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We're looking out
for the safety of all

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
of those people in the community
who receive those items.

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Get frustrated when I
know that the laws have been

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
changed, the Civil Liabilities
Amendment Act has been passed

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.380 align:middle line:90%
in four states.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
From my point of view, give
us the food because it's not

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:47.910 align:middle line:90%
your liability.

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly good.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just
monitoring the quality.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I was with another one of
our major suppliers when I said,

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.100 align:middle line:90%
and what about this and this.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, Ronni,
you're like a jet ski

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.037 align:middle line:84%
trying to pull Queen Mary
or pulling an aeroplane.

01:14:04.037 --> 01:14:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's inspiring, though.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not going to stop.

01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.842 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you shouldn't.

01:14:07.842 --> 01:14:12.090 align:middle line:90%


01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If we've received over 90
tons of food in the last two

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
years, it's about 270,000
meals thanks to Qantas so far.

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.870 align:middle line:90%
It is fantastic.

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be sure that
we don't leave a single bit

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:28.430 align:middle line:90%
of food going to waste.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Not at all.

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

01:14:30.882 --> 01:14:33.650 align:middle line:90%


01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Still no bloody yogurt.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just crazy.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.800 align:middle line:90%


01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had Ronni on
a nonstop schedule.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
There's been London,
there's been South Africa,

01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:52.455 align:middle line:90%
and now Bangkok again.

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
It'll be my first time
traveling with her overseas.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:15:00.510 align:middle line:90%


01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I was given the opportunity
to apply for some funding

01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to bring an OzHarvest
model to Bangkok.

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:10.050 align:middle line:90%


01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:14.160 align:middle line:90%
We're in partnership with SOS.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
They're an existing
organization,

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's one reason
we partnered with them.

01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's a difficult
partnership.

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course we wanted the yellow,
and all the time the King

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
was alive, yellow was
just this perfect color.

01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But we have taken advice
that in Thailand right now,

01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:35.500 align:middle line:90%
it's not politically wise.

Today, our current minister
for the environment,

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Josh Frydenberg, is launching
the national food waste

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.190 align:middle line:90%
strategy.

01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%

what has led us to today.

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
About three months
or four months ago,

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
they asked me for a budget
based on best practice.

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We calculated $30
million on what

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
the first four-year
rollout could be,

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
which would achieve
our 2030 goal.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%

>> Everybody in there is sort of
sitting in shock because it was

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:10.030 align:middle line:90%
such an underwhelming release.

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:16.260 align:middle line:90%
$1.37 million over 24 months.

And I'm here with Ronni,
who's the head of OzHarvest.

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
There are good economic,
good environmental,

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and good social reasons why
we must reduce food waste.

announced a million

We've been working towards it.

01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:12.940 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's going to
take a lot of money, time,

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.904 align:middle line:84%

is in store for all of us.

national TV, and I just

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how to not
look like an idiot.

01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I looked like an
idiot because I didn't

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.980 align:middle line:90%
say what I really thought.

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.100 align:middle line:90%
So that felt shit.

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.990 align:middle line:90%


01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But it would not have
served my end goal

01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to alienate him and make
him look like an idiot.

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Just because I was
politically maneuvered

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:51.995 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that I
endorse the strategy.

of today are not

going to be around in 13 years.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%

what gets votes now,

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:11.092 align:middle line:84%

disappointing part.
