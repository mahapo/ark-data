00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Fanciful tales have long been
told of a magic spring which

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.140 align:middle line:84%
could restore the youth
of anyone who drinks

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:90%
of it or bathes in its waters.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:84%
These legends have
spawned many ventures

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
in search of the fabled
fountain of youth.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:84%
In this modern age,
the search continues,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:84%
but the quest has been taken
up by scientists exploring

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:84%
immortality upon a new
frontier-- within the nucleus

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:90%
of our cells.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It is here where we find little
packets of genetic material

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
called genes, arranged along
twisted, double stranded

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
molecules of DNA
called chromosomes.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The tip of the chromosomes
are capped with telomeres,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and it is here
where we may finally

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
unlock the secrets of
the fountain of youth.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:10%
>>All plants,
animals, fungi have

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:10%
chromosomes that
are like bow ties,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:10%
and at ends are these tips.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:10%
The tips are like
firecracker fuses.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>>You think of a
chromosome like a shoelace.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:10%
The caps, or aglets,
on your shoelaces

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:10%
are equivalent to the
telomeres on the chromosomes.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:10%
The telomere protects
the chromosome.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:10%
>>And they're actually
made up of DNA codes.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:10%
And when our cells
divide, they break off.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:10%
And every time they break
off, it prevents the cells

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:10%
from dividing that many times.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:10%
>>With every cell replication,
a little bit of that chromosome

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:10%
is lost.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:90%
With every cell.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's a white blood
cell, muscle cell, or a heart

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:90%
cell.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.099 align:middle line:90%
We lose a little bit.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make much of a
difference in a year, or 10

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:90%
years, or 15 years, or 30 years.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But in 100 years, it
makes a huge difference.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>We all know that when
the aglets on our shoelaces

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
get shorter, our shoelaces
start to fall apart.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same is true
for our chromosomes.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
When the telomeres on our
chromosomes get short,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
our chromosomes
start to fall apart.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Generally, a
lifetime-- your cells

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
can only divide about 50 times,
and then they stop dividing.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Goes into senescence,
and we die.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Chromosomes start
falling apart,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
our cells lose the ability
to function normally.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And every single disease
you've ever heard of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
has now been connected to
the length of the telomeres.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
When they get short,
it causes-- it's not

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that causes,
but it plays a big role

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
in causing practically
every age-related

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.337 align:middle line:84%
and even non-age-related
ailment that we've heard of.

00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>And this is not fringe theory.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the fundamental
bedrock of molecular biology.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Those chromosomes
will recombine.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll cause
mutations, and we're

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
off to cellular dysfunction
and maybe death.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Mutations occur
just from-- let's say,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
one way is from the
chromosomes rearranging.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So, when a chromosome breaks
and rejoins, that's a mutation.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it essentially puts
the expression machinery

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to express a gene under
control or some other gene.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
chromosomal rearrangements

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:90%
occur, and mutations and stuff.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And those appear to
be the mutations that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.825 align:middle line:90%
actually cause cancer.

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Telomeres are shortening, and
they're causing genetic damage.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And so if it manifests in the
pancreas, you get diabetes.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
In the brain, you
get Alzheimer's.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's one
disease with many faces.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
is, at the core of it,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
the cells are able to
recognize their dysfunction.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
They kill themselves
so the body is

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:90%
in a constant state of renewal.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And the ecology is set up
so that we can live forever.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>What this seems to
suggest is that nature

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
has program at our bodies
to age and eventually die.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The shortening of telomeres
is integral to this process.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>It was discovered
that telomeres

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
get shorter as we age.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.943 align:middle line:10%
And there seemed to be a strong
correlation between the length

00:03:47.943 --> 00:03:51.167 align:middle line:10%
of your telomeres and
your overall age--

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:10%
but more importantly, the
length of your telomeres

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:10%
and your overall health.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
People started noticing that
there were some people that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
were really sick
at young ages-- had

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.205 align:middle line:84%
short telomeres
like old people do.

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a big
correlation that's determined.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And people started speculating
that maybe this had

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
something to do with our
health and our aging.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>The length of that telomere
is correlated to your age.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
And the shorter that it
is, the older you are.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.189 align:middle line:84%
And so all the symptoms
associated with aging

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
are related to the
length of that telomere.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe there's a lot of
things that cause us to age.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:10%
And I think of each of
them as a stick of dynamite

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:10%
that's burning inside of us.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So really, what matters
is which stick of dynamite

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:90%
has the shortest fuse.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And humans, dogs, cats,
horses, sheep, pig, and deer

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones that have
been shown so far to actually

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
have telomere shortening
be their shortest fuse.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The aging has actually
occurred by the changes

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:90%
in gene expression.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
We've been able-- at least when
human cells in Petri dishes

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
show that when we
re-lengthen the telomeres,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:84%
the genes actually go back
to the exact, same expression

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
patterns that they had
when they were young.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:10%
>>There are now some tests
that are available that

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:10%
will tell patients how
long their telomeres are,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:10%
and also what percentage of
them are particularly short.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is very valuable
information to know,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's essentially a
yardstick for how we are aging.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>So ideally, what
you want is to be

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:84%
able to measure not just
the length of telomeres,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.514 align:middle line:84%
how much wick is left on
the candle or firecracker.

00:05:22.514 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:10%
What you want to know
is how much damage

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:10%
has gone on in the chromosome.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>>With over 10,000
scientific articles

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.965 align:middle line:10%
published about
telomeres, scientists

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:10%
have been working hard to
unlock the key to aging.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:10%
In 2009, the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medicine

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:10%
was awarded to
three scientists who

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:10%
discovered how an enzyme called
telomerase impacts telomere

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:10%
length.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>The holy grail of
medicine is looking

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
for telomerase, which
is an enzyme that

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
restores the length
of the telomeres

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
so that your cells
can divide forever.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So telomerase
is an enzyme that

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
can correct any damage
to the chromosome

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:90%
end, which is the telomere.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And one of the
first things we did

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
was to put it into normal skin
cells grown in a Petri dish,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and we found they
became immortal--

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
by the scientist
definition of immortal,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they never
reached the Hayflick limit.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:90%
They never got senescent.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.075 align:middle line:84%
They just kept dividing,
and dividing, and dividing.

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>A cell can be immortal.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Like all your sperm and
eggs, they're immortal.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
They transmit forever because
they have active telomerase.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>By using telomerase to
immortalize human cells,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:84%
scientists hope to find a
cure for a host of diseases,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even stop
or reverse aging.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Until this miracle
cure comes through,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
there are things that we
can do in our everyday lives

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to promote longevity.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>So the idea in science-- it's
been around for a long time--

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
has been to figure out if
there's a way to actually heal

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.947 align:middle line:84%
the end of the DNA instead
of losing something or just

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:90%
stopping the damage.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.779 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way to actually
restore it and get it

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:10%
back to the original
shoelace end

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.581 align:middle line:10%
that we got when we bought
our shoes brand new.

00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:02.955 align:middle line:10%
>>There's quite
a bit of research

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:10%
now showing that there are
a few things that increase

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:10%
the length of the telomeres.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>>Some things that you
can do that are simple

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:10%
is to-- they make
a lot of sense.

the length of telomeres.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a really big deal
in terms of what this means.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.905 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
actually get in there
