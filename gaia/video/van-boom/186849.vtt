[HORN HONKING]

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I bought my first van in the
summer of 2013 because I was

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
sick of wasting
money on hotel rooms.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
In addition to being a
filmmaker, I'm also an author.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I've written several books,
and I used to go on book tours

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
all the time, which
basically means

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
that I would spend between 150
and 200 days a year traveling.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And it also means that I
used to spend between $15,000

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.537 align:middle line:90%
and $20,000 on hotel stays.

00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, the worst part about it was
that I didn't really even get

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
to enjoy these hotel rooms.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I barely set foot
in them, actually.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Typically, how it would go
is I would go to town or city

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.427 align:middle line:90%
and I would teach a class.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I would do a book signing.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.093 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of the night
I'd go back to the hotel room

00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and I would just literally
throw my bones on the bed

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and go to sleep.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Six hours later I'd wake
up, I'd get in the car

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:90%
and go to the next location.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So this expense sucked.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It was 100% unnecessary.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the rational
part of my brain

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
told me that something
had to change.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Prior to purchasing
a Sprinter van

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I did quite a bit of
deliberating about which

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:90%
vehicle would be best for me.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I needed a car that
was both volumous,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I needed a lot of room for
books and heavy film equipment,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:90%
but I also needed fuel economy.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I needed a car that I could
criss-cross the entire United

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
States in and I wouldn't just
get pillaged at the gas pump.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I had my eyes
set on a VW Euro van.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But after perusing
countless auto listings

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I quickly learned that
a 20-year-old beat up

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
microbus with over
200,000 miles on it sells

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
for between 20 and 25 grand.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
This seemed like a
ridiculous amount

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to pay for an old van that
could fall apart at any moment.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:90%
So I kept looking.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I looked into other
options as well,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
such as trucks and campers,
pull-behind trailers and RVs,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
but was ultimately deterred
by high mileage, low fuel

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
economy, lack of reliability,
and or hefty price tags.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Then during a work
trip to Europe

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I discovered the Sprinter
van, and boy, was it glorious.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing embarrassing
or shameful about this van

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It was spacious,
it was practical,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and yet it was somehow classy.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And I instantly wanted one.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So when I returned home
from my overseas trip,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I googled Sprinter van.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I went down to my local Mercedes
dealership and I bought one.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember feeling
extremely nervous

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'd never bought a
new vehicle before, let alone

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
one with a $40,000 price tag.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But again, the money that I
was shucking out on hotel stays

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:90%
helped justify the purchase.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.735 align:middle line:84%
I've owned my van
for five years,

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm proud to
report that I've never

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
had one ounce of regret.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.935 align:middle line:90%
There's been no buyer's remorse.

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Out of all the
different vehicles

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that I've owned in
the past, this van

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
is by far my favorite vehicle
and I absolutely love it.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I like to compare my van to the
transition from a T9 cell phone

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
to a cell phone with
a full keyboard.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you recall,
back in the day,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
we used to have those
brick Nokia phones.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And on those phones you had
to hit each button three times

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:90%
to get a desired letter.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So texting was a
pain in the butt.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we all got phones
with full keyboards, which

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
means that we could now
write text much quicker,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:90%
it was much more convenient.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Our minds were blown
and it was evident

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're never going
back to the old ways.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It just seems archaic
now to do that, right?

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with a van.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:84%
When you experience
firsthand what

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:84%
it's like to be able to freely
move around in your vehicle,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to get up from the driver's
seat and then go into the back,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe when it's raining
or snowing outside,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and yet you're comfortable,
you're standing upright,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you're warm and cozy, this
is an incredible feeling.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And you just can't replicate
it in other vehicles.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So once you experience the
comfort and the convenience

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
of the van you can't go back
to a sedan or a station wagon.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just not happening.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It goes without saying
that paying for hotel rooms

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
is now a thing of
the past for me.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Now when I travel I stay in
my vehicle, and in doing this

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.467 align:middle line:90%
I save heaps of dough.

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm way more
comfortable because I

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
get to sleep in my own bed
surrounded by my own smells

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:90%
every night.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
In addition to being
great work vehicles,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.507 align:middle line:84%
vans are also
fantastic for leisure.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're going
adventuring with your buddies

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
or visiting relatives in another
town, traveling by way of van

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
allows you to be more
spontaneous, more flexible,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
self-reliant, and free.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Presently I don't live
in my van full time.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I use it more like a weekender.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So my girlfriend has a house.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:90%
I live there.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And then whenever we want to go
adventuring, we fill up the van

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and we go.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether that be for a weekend,
or a week, or a month,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.423 align:middle line:90%
this works really well for us.

00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we'd like
to think about it

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of like in
spaceship terms, where

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
the house is the mothership
and the van is the rocket.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And every so often the van has
to resupply like rockets do,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and then we fly off somewhere
else, and go exploring,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
go have fun, go
to work, whatever.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
During the first couple
years of van ownership,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
one thing that I
remember very distinctly

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
is that people used to
stop me on the street.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.863 align:middle line:84%
Random strangers would
stop me on the street

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and they'd ask me a plethora
of different questions.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:84%
They would ask me things like,
what kind of van is that?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you like your van?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
What kind of gas
mileage do you get?

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get it?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
How much was it?

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And then one day all
the questions stopped.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And people just stopped
coming up to me, period.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of strange
because it happened

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:90%
consistently, and then boom.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.148 align:middle line:84%
After pondering on
this for a while

00:07:31.148 --> 00:07:33.278 align:middle line:84%
I figured that the shift
had to do with the fact

00:07:33.278 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that there are more
vans on the road.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.487 align:middle line:84%
While vans and van
life have been around

00:07:36.487 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
since the early '60s,
we are currently

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
seeing one of the biggest van
booms in history right now.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
If you look at commercial
vans sales in America

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
alone since about 2016, you'll
notice that Ford Transits,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:90%
they're the leaders in the US.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
They sell about
14,000 vans a month.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Chevy Express sells
6,000 vans a month.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Ford E-Series, 5.8.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Dodge pro master is
next at 3.3 thousand.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Mercedes Benz is
close behind at 3,000,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and the Nissan NV Series
sells about 1.7 thousand vans

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:90%
per month.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's roughly 33,000
vans per month total,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and 405,000 vans per
year in the US alone.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm no expert, but 405,000
new vans on the road per year

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:90%
seems like a lot of vans.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why it feels like
vans are everywhere these days,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:90%
because they literally are.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Globally, vans appear
to be trending as well.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
In the first half of
2017 Mercedes Benz

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
reported that it sold
nearly 200,000 vans,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.692 align:middle line:84%
mainly Sprinters and
Metris's worldwide.

00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
This marked the
fifth year in a row

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
that their van division
experienced significant growth.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And according to
expert projections,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:84%
this trend will only
continue to increase.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
these sales figures,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
today there's way more resources
about vans and van life

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
There are literally
countless blogs and websites

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and social media accounts and
YouTube videos about vans.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And so people have
a lot more ways

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that they can learn
about van life, which

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
means they no
longer have to stop

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
random strangers on
the street like myself

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and get information
directly from them.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:90%
So what is this all about?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Why are vans booming?

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Clearly there is
a need out there

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
that these vehicles are meeting.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet the answer to
this is anybody's guess.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.428 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even Mercedes
Benz has no idea.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know this
because they actually

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
sent me an email where
they said, "Sergei,

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
why is it that you
think vans are booming?"

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when they're
asking somebody like myself,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I can only assume that they
have questions as to why this is

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:90%
happening and what's going on.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Major publications such as "The
New Yorker," "Time," and "Vice"

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:90%
have their own speculations.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
In one way or another
they all claim

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
vans are trending because van
life is the new American dream.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
This intrigues me
for several reasons.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's a
big bold statement

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
that I automatically
want to challenge.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And number two, it very
well might be true.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Is van life really the
next American dream?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
If so, then why?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Are people moving
into vans because they

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
can no longer afford to
live in traditional houses?

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Or are they simply
shifting their values

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because they're finding that
alternative lifestyles make

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:90%
them more fulfilled and happy?

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's what's going on.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
If this is the case,
does van living

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
actually make people
more happy and fulfilled?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Is this a sustainable lifestyle?

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if van life is
a trend that will someday pass

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and we'll think, "Oh my
god, I can't believe we ever

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
thought this was
cool," or perhaps this

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
is a viable lifestyle
that's here to stay.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I've decided to act
on this curiosity

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and make a movie that
investigates this fan boom.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
This summer I'm going to
jump into my Sprinter van,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go
wherever the wind blows

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
me to try and interview
as many different people

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:84%
as I can that are in some way,
shape, or form tied to vans.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to sit down with as
many different demographics

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
as I can.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
This being young couples,
seasoned vanners,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
solo travelers,
nomadic families,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
companies that manufacture
vans and van products,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and anyone else that's
willing to talk to me.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
down to the bottom

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
of why vans are so popular.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I have no clue whatsoever
if this is a good idea,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:84%
if this movie will
be interesting.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But I have this genuine
curiosity and I'm going for it.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So I suppose you
want a van tour.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's check it out.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
This is our cozy
little Sprinter van.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:90%
This is our bed.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a twin, so we snuggle.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Underneath we have storage
for our camping stove,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:90%
extra camping gear, clothes.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And then up top we
have cargo nets, which

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:84%
we can store our curtains, or
window shades, or more clothes.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
We also have little utility
racks and cute hangers

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.668 align:middle line:90%
as well as some sparkle lights.

00:11:51.668 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's go around back and
I'll show you some more.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the back here we
have our kettle bells.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
This is how we work out
when we're on the road.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And they also provide
extra weight and traction

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:90%
for the van.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is another view
of the van from the back.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
As you can see,
it's super simple.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't live in the van, we
take it for weekend trips,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
so this simple setup
works really great for us.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
On the back of the
van we have a ladder.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It's made by Prime Design,
and it gets us to the top.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a little deck
made of plastic pallets.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect for stargazing,
taking naps, or having picnics.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And extra storage if needed.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Also on the roof we
have a road shower.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what
it sounds like, it's

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:90%
a shower for the road.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us the
opportunity to clean off

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
after surfing, or being in
the lake, or clean the car.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Whenever we desire.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So everything I just showed
you on top of the roof

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
is attached to the
roof via our roof rack.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:90%
The Alurack by Prime Design.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I want to
show you is our VertiRack.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to store
our paddle boards

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of the
van, which frees up

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:90%
space inside of the van for us.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:90%
So that's our van in a nutshell.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So today is June 2nd.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
We're officially kicking off
the production of "Van Boom."

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:90%
We start filming today.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're heading from
Tacoma, Washington

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
up to Bellingham to take
part in a van life festival.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
This festival is
hosted by Freedom Vans.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:84%
They're an outfitter that
customizes Sprinter vans,

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and Ford vans, every
other kind of van.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to go
meet some cool people,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
see some cool vans,
and hopefully gather

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:90%
some interviews.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
What do I think
we're going to learn

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:90%
while making this documentary?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.832 align:middle line:84%
I hope to learn the real
truth about van life.

00:14:12.832 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Because on Instagram
and social media

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:90%
it just looks so gosh darn fun.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know if
it's really that amazing,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and how much you have to make
to afford that kind of life,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of jobs you can
have to live that kind of life.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like
an expensive lifestyle.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And to have an expensive
lifestyle you need a job.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you're living
out of your van

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
you can't always have
a traditional job.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I want
to live in a van

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
myself, though maybe someday
it would be a possibility.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's interesting to
know all this because there's

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people out there
who are considering it,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people who
are considering buying

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.312 align:middle line:90%
a van over buying a house.

00:15:11.312 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I just bought a
house, so I'm going

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to live in the house
and not the van.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But maybe other people will
choose the other way around.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a little
confused sometimes,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people when they

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
go into living in
a van they say it's

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:35.126 align:middle line:84%
because they can't afford to
buy a house or live in a house.

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I-- when you buy
a van, it costs--

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
if you buy a new van it costs
roughly, like, $40,000, Sergei?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
want a really nice

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
build, like
something comfortable

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
where you have a kitchen
and you can actually

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
live in it, that's at
least another 60 grand,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I would think.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Probably more.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But so you're up to
100 grand in this van.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I live in an area
that is appreciating,

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
so if I decide to sell
the house in five years

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I will make money off
of living in my home.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.782 align:middle line:84%
If you have a van they just
break down, you put on miles.

00:16:18.782 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way
that you're going

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:90%
to make money off of your van.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
You're only going to
lose money in the end.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see the
benefit, or I don't

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
see how people say it's cheaper
than buying your own home.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, through
this documentary

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:90%
we'll get to the bottom of that.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.834 align:middle line:84%
And people can explain why it's
cheaper than owning a home.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.798 align:middle line:90%

00:16:44.798 --> 00:17:23.194 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.194 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Who says you can't have a lot
of shoes if you live in a van?

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.813 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Tom.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I run a company with my partner,
Kyleigh, called Freedom Vans.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are all
about giving people

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:90%
chances to live off the grid.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Sidestep mortgage if you want.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You can live out of your
van, have solar power,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
have all your amenities,
comfortable living space,

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
all in a tiny little
space on wheels.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Vans are popular and
gaining popularity

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
because they take the
automotive industry

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and basically combine
all of their genres

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
into one space that performs
as well as each of them

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and actually outperforms
a lot of them.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
They are people carriers,
they're efficient on fuel,

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
they can load a lot of job
materials, heavy equipment.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They can get from
A to B comfortably.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:90%
They do it all.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I got inspired for
the van life movement

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
because of housing crisis.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm a dog owner, but I'm
not wealthy home owner

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when I tried to move from
one lease to find a new place,

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get anything.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Nobody would sign me up.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
"You have a dog, you
can't rent here."

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a van that I
used to travel for mountain bike

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:90%
racing.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I started
feeling like I wasn't

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.922 align:middle line:84%
going to have a catch net to
land in when my lease ended.

00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "I'm not
going to be homeless."

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So I took matters
into my own hands.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And I built myself a weekender

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I built a little Ford
Econoline from the mid 90s

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:90%
that was an old conversion van.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I gutted it and I
put a desk in there

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:90%
that I used for a counter.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I built the power system,
and stuffed a fridge,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and cut in a sink, and glued
a microwave to the desk.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to do
pumps, but I found a pond pump

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:90%
and it worked.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of how
it all started for me.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt
so liberated when

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I figured out I
could comfortably

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:90%
live for a month out of a van.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
For one whole month I
didn't have a house.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So then I realized
van life was sweet.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:90%
It was simple, 100% liberating.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I felt no longer
like I was trapped

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
by expensive real estate
that I couldn't afford.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I felt like for a
low investment I

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
could get a comfortable
space, and that sort of stair

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
stepped me up to doing that
same thing for other people now.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the things
that we do build

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:84%
are for people who
are gone weekenders.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
a weekend warrior,

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
they want to go traveling,
get out of town.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.633 align:middle line:84%
Stress relief, you
know, vacation stuff.

00:20:12.633 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
That's important, and it
matters a lot to everybody.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be
able to do that.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But then there's also
the people like traveling

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
nurses who are going somewhere
for seven weeks at a time.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
They've got a traveling
stipend and they're

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:90%
getting paid for housing.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
My first full-time client-based
Freedom Van was Dana.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
She has her van named Amelia.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
She lives out of
it in California.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is a good
example of a new way

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about how you can
approach your living space.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
She pays about $700
a month, is her van

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:90%
plus conversion payment.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It was all worked in
on the same purchase.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So her van purchase
and her conversion

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:84%
were lumped into one, and the
cost is about $700 a month.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
She owns it via the bank, but
in an area where a one bedroom

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.457 align:middle line:84%
apartment is $2,200,
San Francisco Bay area

00:21:04.457 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is $2,300 to $2,600 for
a one bedroom apartment.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So her one bedroom van in the
spaces she was traveling in

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:90%
is $700 a month.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pretty good system,
when you look at the numbers.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.337 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that
economically it makes sense,

00:21:19.337 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of people
turning to van life for that

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But the motivator is more
that our Millennials,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
they're all coming
of age to buy things.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing all these
vans and these epic photos

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:90%
on Instagram.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And they see that and
then they want to live it.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The pictures you see of
people living on Instagram,

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.075 align:middle line:84%
and they're just always
having a joyous time,

00:21:44.075 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:90%
everything's perfect.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> How does van life on social
media differ from real van

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think that social
media just gives you a glimpse

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of what van life is.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you're in all of
these beautiful places

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and you're having all
these experiences.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think what I miss the
most was experiencing them

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.140 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's definitely
becoming easier

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.145 align:middle line:84%
as more people are into
van life and more people

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
are traveling with
their friends.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But when we were on the road,
our friends were more grounded

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't necessarily
travel everywhere with us.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So I missed just having people
that I saw all the time,

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:90%
and that community feeling.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's nice to see people who
are doing van life are building

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.458 align:middle line:90%
those communities.

00:22:28.458 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's just a
glimpse on social media.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how that actually
translates into real life.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It didn't translate for me.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the aspect of
social media that's like,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
everyone posts their
beautiful photos,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and it just looks so idealistic.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it really like that?

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so these
beautiful photos, honestly,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:84%
van life brought me to
the most beautiful places.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think
back on my own photos

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
like, I just need
that right now.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really fortunate
to live in a place that

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
has all these beautiful
lakes and trees.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why we ended up here

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
after traveling
to so many places

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to see where we
really wanted to be.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just think back on some
of these photos that I took

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and how much I
enjoyed those days.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And those little
glimpses, there's

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
so much to those days
that are actually

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:90%
not portrayed in the photos.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the
Noggin van crib.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a 1995 Dodge
All Transit Vehicle.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:90%
We call her Rammie.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
We designed the bed,
the kitchen, everything,

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:84%
so it would be extremely
useful and beneficial

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:84%
to our kind of lifestyle that
we thought we'd be living.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And then in this
back unit here we

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
have designed this huge kind
of box which is mainly storage

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
but you can also have a
person or to sleep on this.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:90%
This unit pops out.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing
about this is her

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and I could both work
on our laptops all day.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We have little cushions that
you can sit on the wheel wells.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we built out
these wood little things.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And then we have cushions.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you could sit here
and work for eight hours.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's extremely useful for
both of us to work and live.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We both kind of have our
own spaces when we need it,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:90%
which is great.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of like having a
house or a separate room.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, go
to a coffee place

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
or pop out of the
van for a little bit.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the cost of van life?

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks about how much
cheaper it is than house life.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Did you do any--
actual any calculation?

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>> So what does van life cost?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So van life for us, like,
so we have an apartment here

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:90%
in Bellingham, at Darby.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It was $1,000 a month.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
internet and utilities,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and so it's about
13, 14 a month.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was about
two years ago.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:90%
So we hopped in the van.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:84%
We were spending, with
all of our bills together

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and everything in our
relationship, about $3,000

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:90%
a month.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:90%
So we had a lot of bills.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We had student debts,
and credit cards,

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and starting the business,
and all this expense.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:84%
We hopped in the van and we were
able to immediately get down

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:90%
to like $1,500.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we started looking
at our food expenses in LA.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a
problem with sushi,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and really I love Thai food.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we were going
out to eat a lot.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, OK, we can
really cut this down even more.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Then we started
cooking every day.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we started getting into
the more of the vegan lifestyle

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and food, you know,
fruits and vegetables,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:90%
and raw organic kind of cooking.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And that really
saved a lot of money.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And so then we were down
like $1,000 a month,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, even
like $800 a month.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.092 align:middle line:90%
If you don't drive a whole lot.

00:25:53.092 --> 00:25:53.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:25:53.892 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So if I understand
you correctly,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you went from roughly $3,000
a month to instantly $1,500

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.400 align:middle line:90%
and were able to go down--

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> To about $1,800.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> $1,800 a month.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was with a lot
of travel and not being cheap

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:90%
on organics, and buying--

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a huge saving.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --proteins and
stuff like that.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've seen some of
these people on YouTube, like,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, van life is so cheap,
but now my coffee bill,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
because I hang out at coffee
shops, has skyrocketed."

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I had already
been doing that,

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
so that was already
included in my costs.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, in Bellingham I was
going to four to eight coffee

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:90%
meetings a day.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And that really adds up.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So what I would do in
business meetings is

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I would take my
Starbucks receipt

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
or Woods Coffee in
Bellingham, I would

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
take it to different
meetings and say hey,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:90%
I bought one 30 minutes ago.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.522 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm here every
day, you guys see me, so.

00:26:44.522 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:90%
So they got to know me.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But I would try and save
a lot of money doing that.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But LA, we would go to
libraries, parks, beaches.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, a lot of free Wi-Fi.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Near malls, schools, a
lot of things like that.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Housing, apartments.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So we just bounced
around like that

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and not try and go
in coffee shops.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Chris Paige Owens.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Most people call me Ma.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:90%
From vanning, at least.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I live in Puyallup, Washington.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Been vanning since 1978.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Traveled all over
the United States

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and even into
England with vanning.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does
vanning mean to you?

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Because you're like, you're--

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
us young people would say you're
the original gangster, the OG.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:90%
What does vanning mean to you?

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's family.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It's friends.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:90%
It's life.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
You look around,
you see the vans.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Young people are
coming back into it.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of us old people.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm 71 years old.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So, grandma and
great-grandmother.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's fun.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did you get back--

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
get into vanning
originally in the '70s?

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody stopped us on
the road and says, "Hey,

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:84%
there's a van club
meeting a Shakey's at 7

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:90%
o'clock on Thursday night."

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:90%
So we went.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Been vanning ever since.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.043 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like vans are
becoming more and more popular.

00:28:01.043 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that was true?

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say that.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
Sprinter vans, the vans

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.333 align:middle line:90%
are becoming more popular.

00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are living in them

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
afford the houses.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
off the grid.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Or just traveling.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do it when you're young,
because when you get older

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:90%
they call it the golden years.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean it is.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm Still waiting
to see the goal.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you give us a tip or
two of something you wish you

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.995 align:middle line:84%
would have known at
the very beginning,

00:28:25.995 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:84%
would have maybe saved you
a little bit of headache?

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We bought a brand new
van, Ford van, in 1976.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:90%
So what would I do different?

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I would have gone in
1976 to some van runs

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and found out, like here,
what they look like inside,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:90%
what to do with the inside.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Because ours was a
blank screen type thing.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And we put interior
in it on our own.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.303 align:middle line:84%
And then we went to vanity
vans in '78, and found out,

00:28:56.303 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, we should have done this,
or we should have done that.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The best thing to do is
go with a blank screen

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:90%
and see what to do.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the easiest
way to find out.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Make it yours, but you can
pick up ideas here or there.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Ma.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So the van rally
just finished.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:84%
That was literally my
first ever van event.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
I'm blown away

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
by how genuine people were,
how excited they were.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I realized at the
event that even

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:84%
though I'm in the van realm on
YouTube and I make van videos,

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.400 align:middle line:84%
doing stuff on the internet by
yourself puts you in a vacuum.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And you never really get
to be part of the community

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:90%
if you only do that.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, for anything, whether
that be vans, or surf boarding,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.878 align:middle line:84%
or skateboarding, or whatever,
I don't think you can really

00:29:46.878 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
be part of the community
unless you go out

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and meet people that
do the same thing

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and actually shake their hand,
and look inside their vans.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
That's really what makes
that connection, what

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:90%
makes that tight knit.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.200 align:middle line:84%
In this video I
really want to get

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of why
vans are trending.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Some would say why they're
resurfacing, because they

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:90%
were a thing in the '70s.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And I keep attributing
it to this one thing.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it an economic reason?

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Is it adventure?

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
What I think I'm going to
learn in this documentary

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:90%
is that it's all of the above.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.370 align:middle line:84%
The van package is just
too good to pass up.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a truck.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It's an RV.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a passenger car
all in one it allows

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:90%
you to be very adventurous.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:90%
It saves you money.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:90%
It's all of the above.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's my new

So when you're making
breakfast in nature,

00:33:50.823 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
you always want
to look around you

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.550 align:middle line:84%
because you might just find
some wild growing vegetables.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:90%
This right here is wild onion.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.770 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to identify
an onion is by the smell.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:84%
All onions smell the same,
just like a store bought onion.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And today we're just going to
harvest a few for our meal.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're only going
to harvest the top.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.159 align:middle line:84%
We're going to leave the
roots intact so as not

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:90%
to disturb the plant too much.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:84%
The seeds and fruits
of a plant are

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:84%
nature's gift to the creature,
to the animal, to the human.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's OK to take a
couple, throw them in your meal.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes your
meal more nutritious

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:84%
because they grow in topsoil
that hasn't been depleted.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
Their root systems
are longer, so they're

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
like nature's super food.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:90%

So Kyleigh and I are
driving in the van.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:84%
We're heading to the
VanLife Diaries van

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:90%
festival in Victor, Idaho.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But I've been texting on the
phone with Dave and Diane

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:90%
from Aluminess this entire time.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.947 align:middle line:84%
And they just agreed
to sit down with me

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:43.989 align:middle line:90%
and give me an interview.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is we
have to divert a little bit.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And by a little bit, I
mean like 300 to 500 miles

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:90%
out of our way.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.389 align:middle line:84%
If you're not familiar
with Aluminess,

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
they are a premium company that
manufactures racks and ladders

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:84%
for trucks and vans Dave
and Diane have been doing

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:90%
this for many, many years.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
They know all the ins
and outs of van life.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is an opportunity
that I just can't pass up.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So this means that we
are probably not going

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:84%
to be sleeping much in
the next couple days,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.100 align:middle line:84%
because we now have to veer
north to Coeur d'Alene, which

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is a few hundred
miles out of our way.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
have to veer south

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.070 align:middle line:84%
back to our original
destination, which

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:18.968 align:middle line:90%
is Victor, Idaho.

00:35:18.968 --> 00:35:21.010 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, I don't
even care because this

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:90%
is an incredible opportunity.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't
think I'd get it.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Whoo!

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So you want to know a
little bit about the van life

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, so I thought I'd
take you back to what I think is

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:84%
kind of at least a
decent starting point.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
Volkswagen camper van.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
around for people

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to actually go camp in a van
way back in the '60s, I believe.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
the first year.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But a gentleman,
Charles and his dad

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
started a company
called Sportsmobile in I

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.970 align:middle line:90%
believe Austin, Texas.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They always had a
shop in Indiana,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and they scaled way
up with Volkswagen.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And then West Valley
came on the picture,

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.820 align:middle line:90%
or was on there as well.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they started doing
Ford, Chevy, Dodge, and so on.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of where the
whole van thing originally

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.490 align:middle line:90%
was, in my mind, started.

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And then in about, till
'91 or '92, a gentleman,

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Alan Feld, who actually
owns Sportsmobile West,

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.450 align:middle line:84%
he'd worked for me when he was
20 years old in a stockroom

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.350 align:middle line:90%
at a medical device company.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And he went on to do some
other things beyond that.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And one was sales, and he ran
into a Sportsmobile, which

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:84%
was a van converted to a motor
home, a Class B motor home,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.460 align:middle line:90%
they call them.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And he felt he wanted one.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And he found out he had
to go to Texas to get one.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And so he thought
it'd be a great idea

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to do a franchise or
something in California.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And Charles, who was the one
who started that or owned it

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:90%
at the time, was not interested.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.955 align:middle line:84%
Didn't want to
scale up again, he

00:36:47.955 --> 00:36:49.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't want anything to
do with another business.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Would just like to have
his little shop down there

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.628 align:middle line:84%
and build four or five
a month and that was it.

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And so Alan asked me to go with
him down there to talk to him

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and see if we could
talk him into it.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.535 align:middle line:84%
So we grabbed on a plane
and went down there.

00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And Charles changed his tone
after talking both of us,

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and said OK and
gave us a go ahead.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I chose not to do it with Alan,
mainly because I didn't want

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to lose a friend over stuff.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'd done a big business for
a group of open heart surgeons

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, just
don't want to get

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:90%
involved in that kind of stuff.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, over the years
Alan basically started

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
making these vans out
of Chevys and Fords.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And then he started looking
more at the younger people.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that it was
kind of retirement van.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:84%
People would retire,
get one of these,

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.008 align:middle line:84%
go see the national parks, stay
in a hotel once in a while.

00:37:33.008 --> 00:37:34.835 align:middle line:90%
But they had some camping and--

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:36.960 align:middle line:84%
small camping capability,
but not a big motor home.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So Alan started putting
the big tires on.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And hey, you can go out in
the back country and so on.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he got a company
called Quigley Motor

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Company to convert some
to four wheel drive.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Quigley Motor Company's back
in Manchester, Pennsylvania.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.467 align:middle line:84%
And so they started making
him four wheel drives for him,

00:37:51.467 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:84%
send him out an empty
van, four wheel drive.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.348 align:middle line:84%
He'd convert it to the
whole pop top version

00:37:56.348 --> 00:37:57.640 align:middle line:90%
like the one you saw out front.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then after about two
years, all of a sudden

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:84%
there was a problem
with four wheel drive.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The front ends
were all worn out.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:84%
They were shaking, they
were causing problems,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:84%
brakes were
squeaking, and so on.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And they argued back and
forth about the problem,

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
whose problem it was, and
who's going to fix it.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.953 align:middle line:84%
And actually Quigley, Mike
Quigley back east canceled

00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:84%
all the warranties
on all the customers,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.618 align:middle line:90%
sent them all a letter.

00:38:15.618 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Alan happened to
call me up because I

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:84%
build the street rods, and said,
"Just tell me how to fix it."

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.887 align:middle line:84%
He's really good on the
marketing and customer

00:38:20.887 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:90%
service and sales and so on.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm kind of the
nuts and bolts nut.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I went up there
and took some apart,

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.120 align:middle line:84%
flew back east, worked
with Mike Quigley.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We redesigned the
front end and so on.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But one of the issues was
they were putting these steel

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.262 align:middle line:84%
bumpers that were
mainly used on farms

00:38:35.262 --> 00:38:37.595 align:middle line:84%
for pushing combines and stuff
around, that weighed 300,

00:38:37.595 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:90%
400 pounds.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And the guy's doing 15, 30
miles an hour kind of thing.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they were tearing
up the front end as well as

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:90%
some other issues that we saw.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to get his suppliers
to make them out of aluminum.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.950 align:middle line:84%
They were quite
rude about what type

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.160 align:middle line:84%
of less than intelligent
person would make something out

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.070 align:middle line:90%
of aluminum.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted a beer can
or Japanese pop metal,

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:90%
go see Coors or Budweiser.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So next thing you know
I'm in my driveway

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
with a sheet of aluminum
and a saw and a welder,

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.647 align:middle line:84%
and I'm mumbling
about those guys.

00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm trying to
tell them that fighter

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.367 align:middle line:84%
jets land at full
throttle on a carrier,

00:39:12.367 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and that's lightweight material.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all about design.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I made some
and took it up.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.733 align:middle line:90%
And Sportsmobile liked it.

00:39:18.733 --> 00:39:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I was retired at the
time, so I could do that.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.213 align:middle line:84%
And then I went and
found a guy down

00:39:23.213 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
on the boat docks that could
weld way better than I could,

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.463 align:middle line:84%
manipulate aluminum a
lot better than I did.

00:39:27.463 --> 00:39:30.173 align:middle line:84%
And so I just would buy all
the material, take it to him,

00:39:30.173 --> 00:39:31.090 align:middle line:90%
all cut out and so on.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
He'd weld them up, I'd take them
up to Fresno from San Diego,

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:90%
drop them off.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that it just grew.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I just started
adding more items.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Nerf bars, rear
bumpers, roof racks,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:90%
ladders, that kind of thing.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We started building
these things actually

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:84%
in the parking lot of sports
fishing company with one guy,

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I got 800 square feet,
then 1,000, then 2,000, 3,000,

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.080 align:middle line:90%
5,000, 10,000.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.690 align:middle line:90%
We're up to 30,000 feet now.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we bring
people on and teach them

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:90%
how we want to do the product.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We design it for the features
and benefits that we think,

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
or that we get feedback
from our customers.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Many of our customers are
depicted in these drawings

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.300 align:middle line:90%
They're pioneers.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.163 align:middle line:84%
They find out a way to break it
or something that doesn't do,

00:40:13.163 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and they get a few
errors in their back.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we invite them back in
and we replace it or fix it

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.260 align:middle line:90%
or evolve it.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of our
philosophy is to try and make

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.790 align:middle line:90%
the best product out there.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for the aluminum
is one, it's lightweight,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.770 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't take
up the suspension

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that you need when
you're going off road.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you compress
that suspension,

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
you're back to zero even
if you spend a lot of money

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.830 align:middle line:90%
to improve it.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Now you're on the hot seat.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Why are vans booming?

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.500 align:middle line:90%
What's your assessment?

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The new vans, one,
are much more efficient.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So they can get up in the
area of 20 miles per gallon.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot more room.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.140 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot more features.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the previous vans
were very, pretty tight.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
two people in those

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.080 align:middle line:84%
there's not much room
to get around and so on.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.435 align:middle line:84%
But in the Sprinter van and
the Transit van and stuff

00:41:00.435 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:84%
you get different lengths, so
you can get a lot more gear

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:03.290 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And people are wanting to take
more and more stuff with them.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So it accommodates
more of their toys

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and their pleasures of kayaks,
and bicycles, and motorcycles,

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
are more versatile,

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.440 align:middle line:90%
they're more economical.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going from 10 miles
a gallon to close to 20.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.440 align:middle line:90%
And the longevity.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.580 align:middle line:90%
You know, back early on--

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm an old guy--

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
vehicles lasted
80,000, 90,000 miles.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Now Mercedes van has
got a track record

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.818 align:middle line:90%
of going 4 or 500,000 miles.

00:41:29.818 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So even though they're
much more expensive,

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.815 align:middle line:84%
the cost for the
life is a lot less.

00:41:33.815 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> How about the types of
people that you're seeing.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.075 align:middle line:84%
Is it young people, old
people, or a big mix?

00:41:40.075 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Who would you say your
average customer is?

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> On a personal opinion basis I
would believe that our customer

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.820 align:middle line:90%
base is younger now.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the original
van market, I always

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:90%
labeled as the blue hairs.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.040 align:middle line:84%
These people are
retired, and they

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.950 align:middle line:84%
want to now go out and
see the great old US of A,

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and they got these vans that
they would camp in their tool

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.440 align:middle line:84%
drive, pretty basic, and
it'd allow them to go

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:90%
to national parks and things.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Today it's the youth,
the sports-minded

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.980 align:middle line:84%
has taken their mountain
bikes, and their kayaks,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and their surfboards.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Mexico's a great wonderland.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say the big
market we had early on

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:17.390 align:middle line:84%
were teachers and firefighters
who had the time off and could

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.060 align:middle line:84%
explore further
beyond the pavement.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
that went to Mexico

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:84%
surfing, fishing,
that kind of thing,

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
that went to, you

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.941 align:middle line:84%
know, off roading and
to the desert and so on.

We drive a 1964 Clark

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.840 align:middle line:84%
We ended up finding a
small RV, but we still

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.190 align:middle line:90%
kind of refer to it as a van.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It kind of feels
like a van to us.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And we've been on the road
for a little over a year now.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Our home is our vehicle.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're not tied down,
so we can go over we want.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And we do.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:84%
We've been all over the

>> And my name is Taz Darian.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:84%
We chose to go with
a trailer as opposed

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to a van because we have
the flexibility of leaving

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:08.900 align:middle line:84%
our home at the
campground or wherever

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.660 align:middle line:84%
we decide to stay and go
explore in our vehicle.

actually live more in that you

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.850 align:middle line:90%
in a box, essentially.

these possessions.

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:29.850 align:middle line:90%
You really don't need much.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:84%
People think bigger is
better, more is better.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, traveling full
time in our little trailer

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.080 align:middle line:90%
has taught us to minimize.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:84%
We actually ended up
going home briefly just

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of half of our
gear because we really

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.820 align:middle line:90%
didn't need that much.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.040 align:middle line:84%
We just need the simple
necessities to survive.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, the basic needs
really to be comfortable.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And actually living this way
teaches you what you truly

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:90%
need to be comfortable.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

we don't have a bathroom.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But it kind of teaches you
to appreciate the things

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that you take for granted when
you did have all those things.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Josh, and we're driving
a 1987 Vanogan Westfalia.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm Jen.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've been on the road
for about three weeks.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We're planning to be on the
road for many months coming up.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going up to
Alaska and hopefully

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.570 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
Patagonia after that.

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> She's an '82
Vanagon Westfalia.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I got it a
couple of years ago.

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd wanted one for a
long time, and we just--

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.160 align:middle line:84%
it was lime green,
and that was it.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.868 align:middle line:84%
Saw it, and I was
like, "That's the one."

00:46:40.868 --> 00:46:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Sprinter was always
the best option for us.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We wanted a four wheel
drive, we wanted the diesel

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:84%
for the gas mileage, and we
wanted standing room height

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.140 align:middle line:90%
in the van.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I think most
people I do van life,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.460 align:middle line:84%
they really love the
idea of sustainability,

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and being off grid,
and minimalism.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.990 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but think
of all of those things when

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:01.430 align:middle line:90%
you think of a Tesla, right?

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Zero emissions,
it's small, they're

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:90%
also very sleek and minimal.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I love cars, and
it's sexy as hell.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:90%
So how could you not?

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Living in a zero
emission vehicle

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.790 align:middle line:84%
has offset my carbon
footprint immensely.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:15.870 align:middle line:90%
And it feels great every day.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Not just driving,
but living in it.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Seven Grey,
and I am driving a Stepvan.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a 1996
Grumman Olson Stepvan.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people confuse a
Stepvan with a box truck.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Box trucks are typically
a cab separate front,

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and that can either be a van
front or traditional truck

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.770 align:middle line:84%
front with the big square,
rectangular box on the back.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Stepvans are more like bread
trucks, or UPS or FedEx trucks.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:84%
The front doors
are sliding doors.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.300 align:middle line:90%
They slide into pockets.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.512 align:middle line:84%
And also they have steps right
on the passenger side, which

00:47:50.512 --> 00:47:51.720 align:middle line:90%
is where they get their name.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's just
a bunch of steps.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting on
the steps right now.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I had a number of
criteria for my vehicle.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of those was
primarily headroom.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm nearly 6 foot 6,
and a Sprinter van

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.300 align:middle line:90%
maxes out at about 6 foot 3.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to walk
around with my head tilting

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So I needed a vehicle
that was tall enough

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:90%
for me and in my price range.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to finance
it, I wanted to pay cash.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're built
for industrial use.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.815 align:middle line:84%
Like, the engine in this
particular vehicle, a Cummins

00:48:19.815 --> 00:48:22.700 align:middle line:84%
5.9, is built for
a million miles

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
industrial engine.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I bought it with
10,000 miles on it.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:30.890 align:middle line:84%
That means I've got 990,000
miles of potential use.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We drive a 2006
Sprinter 3500 Dually.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.370 align:middle line:90%
We got married in November 2016.

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But we were living in
Denver, had a great life.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything was awesome.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could just kind
of extrapolate out the next 15

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.210 align:middle line:84%
years and see what normal
life was going to be for us.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And it scared us
both a little bit.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we started thinking
about trips we could go on,

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:84%
just kind of like things we
can do to change things up.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Started getting involved
in the van life community

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.250 align:middle line:90%
through Instagram.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And then one Saturday
afternoon we just kind of sat

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.507 align:middle line:84%
down, got out a
spreadsheet, and actually

00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:01.590 align:middle line:90%
built out the whole thing.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, could we make this work
financially on the road?

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.030 align:middle line:90%
What would van life look like?

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And then exactly 10 days
later we bought a van.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.112 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:10.112 --> 00:49:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2016 we gave up our house,
put everything in storage,

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and we started traveling in a
truck and trailer because it

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.950 align:middle line:84%
was a fairly easy transition
from a house to a trailer.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.780 align:middle line:84%
It was 300 square
feet and we could

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.180 align:middle line:84%
convince our
17-year-old daughter

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.680 align:middle line:90%
that it would be a good idea.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.320 align:middle line:84%
After traveling for about a
year in the truck and trailer

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.320 align:middle line:84%
we realized that we were limited
as far as where we could go

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.670 align:middle line:90%
and what we could see.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.465 align:middle line:84%
And we started brainstorming
as to what we wanted to do

00:49:39.465 --> 00:49:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and how we wanted
things to look.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And a smaller space was not
that big of a transition for us.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And we started
looking around and we

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.070 align:middle line:84%
wanted something that
would accommodate all of us

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.090 align:middle line:84%
comfortably, we'd all
have our own beds,

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.720 align:middle line:84%
except for the two of us,
and we could stand in,

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and was good on gas, because
our truck and trailer was not.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So we gravitated towards
a Sprinter van because

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.910 align:middle line:90%
of the space and height.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Quick tour on the van.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Biggest I guess struggle
was to figure out

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.570 align:middle line:90%
how to put five of us in here.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big things
that we came up with

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a bunk bed
system for the boys.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.000 align:middle line:84%
This platform folds
out, allowing Josiah

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.530 align:middle line:90%
to have a bed down below.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we got this bed here
that will kind of pull up

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.650 align:middle line:84%
into the ceiling,
lock in on the walls,

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.730 align:middle line:84%
pull up on some
straps in the front.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
Samuel's bed.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we hold
the two boys in there.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:90%
This is where the kids travel.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.700 align:middle line:84%
There are seat
belts in there, that

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.283 align:middle line:84%
was a big concern
for a lot of people,

00:50:35.283 --> 00:50:37.175 align:middle line:84%
that we weren't going
to keep our kids safe.

00:50:37.175 --> 00:50:39.010 align:middle line:90%
So seat belts in there.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Storage throughout the bottom.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.400 align:middle line:84%
This will slide out, allowing
Sarah to have an almost

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.460 align:middle line:90%
twin kind of bed system.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I guess in the back we
have a full size RV queen

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:54.880 align:middle line:90%
bed for both me and Tracy.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.190 align:middle line:84%
It also doubles as
kind of our lounge area

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:02.440 align:middle line:84%
when it's movie night, or when
the kids need to stretch out.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Tracy's favorite
place to basically

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.492 align:middle line:84%
slide some pillows up, kick
the doors open in the morning.

00:51:07.492 --> 00:51:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I make her a cup
of coffee, and she

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:11.050 align:middle line:84%
takes in the view
wherever we happen

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:90%
to be calling home that day.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Fabbed up this aluminum shelf.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Runs the full length of the
van, allowing each of us

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.650 align:middle line:84%
to have two bins
each for our clothes.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.770 align:middle line:84%
If you can't fit it in the bin
it wasn't allowed on the van.

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm 67 now.

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.840 align:middle line:84%
But in my late
teens and early 20s

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time
hitchhiking around the country.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And settled down, but I knew
that I wanted to travel again.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And hitchhiking it later
on was not that great.

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:43.660 align:middle line:90%
So I always wanted to do a van.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of
eventually found the van

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that we liked, converted
it, spent our maiden voyage

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
about five years ago going
through New Mexico, Colorado,

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Wyoming, and then back
home to northern New York.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And it worked out fairly well.

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sylvie what's it like to
live with Rich on the road?

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that 90% of
the time it's incredibly

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:90%
comfortable.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought I
would be able to say

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that because sharing a very
small space is very difficult.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But we really are very
comfortable with one another.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:22.300 align:middle line:84%
We listen to one another,
we give each other space,

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.670 align:middle line:84%
we know how to move
around one another.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:25.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's been great.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:27.190 align:middle line:90%
It really has.

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And those little rough
moments, we worked it out.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So we were just talking about
how and why we're in a van,

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.690 align:middle line:90%
and we have no idea.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Like, I really wanted to.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I saw stuff on the internet, and
I was like that'd be super rad.

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I pitched it to
her, and she's like, "Nah."

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And then like a month later
or something, she was like,

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.970 align:middle line:90%
"Actually, we should do that."

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.928 align:middle line:84%
So then the next week we
went and bought a van,

00:52:48.928 --> 00:52:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and then started building it.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.550 align:middle line:90%
So I never really looked back.

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:90%
We never really questioned it.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.160 align:middle line:90%
It was weird.

00:52:58.847 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Good example right now.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.230 align:middle line:90%
They're very active.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think it'll be good
once we can be outside more,

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:11.967 align:middle line:84%
and we're in more
even temperatures.

00:53:11.967 --> 00:53:13.050 align:middle line:90%

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.754 align:middle line:84%

happen, we'll see.

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> My reason for living in small
has to do with environmental

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.670 align:middle line:90%
initiatives.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I want to reduce my
environmental footprint.

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that when I
was living in the city

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time
conceptualizing

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.070 align:middle line:90%
how much I was using.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And so van life was a
way for me to cut back

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.580 align:middle line:84%
on my water use, my electricity,
connect with nature,

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.727 align:middle line:84%
and play a bigger role in
being an environmental steward.

00:53:54.727 --> 00:53:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
definitely done that.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been more aware, I
live more intentionally.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And through my
social media I try

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to encourage people
to do the same.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Even small things, even if
they're not living in a van.

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And next month, July,
I am going to be

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:84%
part of a 30-day
plastic-free challenge

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'm encouraging
the van life community

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.650 align:middle line:90%
to be a part of that as well.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a step
in the direction

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.750 align:middle line:90%
of trying to make some change.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.805 align:middle line:84%
And I think together
as a community

00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:30.660 align:middle line:84%
if we all change we can
have a really big impact.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.652 align:middle line:84%
>> I personally think there's
a minimalism movement, sort of.

00:54:34.652 --> 00:54:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that as that
catches on more people

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:40.070 align:middle line:84%
are realizing that stuff
really doesn't make them happy.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the experiences that
you have that make you happy.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.250 align:middle line:84%
At least for us,
that I've realized.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So having not very
much stuff helps

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.260 align:middle line:84%
you to not be distracted
from the things in your life

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and instead focus on the
experiences that you have

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and the memories
that you can create.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Amanda and I were
living in San Francisco.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We were both
freelancing, and we'd

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.110 align:middle line:90%
been doing a bunch of traveling.

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.883 align:middle line:84%
We took a 3 and 1/2 month trip
to South America together,

00:55:05.883 --> 00:55:07.550 align:middle line:84%
did the whole West
Coast of the country.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we got back
to San Francisco

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and were living on
our freelancer income,

00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:15.690 align:middle line:84%
it felt like a tough
balance to strike there.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The cost of living
was really high.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And just the amount
of hustle that

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.160 align:middle line:84%
needed to happen to exist there
in a comfortable financial

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.320 align:middle line:84%
state was just more
than we wanted to do.

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was the threshold
between just constantly working

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.725 align:middle line:84%
versus doing something
that we really loved

00:55:32.725 --> 00:55:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and having some free
time to ourselves.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It felt like the balance
was off much more

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.970 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
of looking for work

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:40.262 align:middle line:90%
and being concerned about that.

00:55:40.262 --> 00:55:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So we love to travel, and
we had this crazy idea.

00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Not too crazy,
really, but we said,

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, why don't
we look for a vam

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.823 align:middle line:90%
and see how that could work out.

00:55:48.823 --> 00:55:49.740 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty much it.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Cost of living in San
Francisco, man, it'll

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.380 align:middle line:90%
make you do some crazy stuff.

And I don't know.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I think a certain group of
people are tapping into that.

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.372 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone can go
to the moon, but damn it,

00:56:07.372 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
you could drive out to the
middle of nowhere, Bears Ears,

and watch the sunrise
over the Colorado River

in it.

And so I don't know.

00:56:24.553 --> 00:56:26.220 align:middle line:84%

That's about as much as if--

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.050 align:middle line:84%
as far as I've
thought through it.

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Try not to overthink it.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.950 align:middle line:84%

looking to make long term

an undergrad I started

an education company

It's actually a nonprofit.

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We partnered with the NBA
and made a fun math game

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:43.720 align:middle line:84%
for elementary and
middle school students.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So we work across 30 states,
about 35,000 students

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.240 align:middle line:90%
on a weekly basis.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And our whole team is remote.

spread out across the country,
we're a distributed company.

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had this idea,
brought it to my board,

00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.427 align:middle line:84%
shared with some
other staff members.

00:57:59.427 --> 00:58:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, as long as
you can still get to the place

where you need to
fly to for work,

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.240 align:middle line:90%
it shouldn't be a problem.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.823 align:middle line:84%

fortunate that I can

00:58:05.823 --> 00:58:08.190 align:middle line:90%
work wherever there's Wi-Fi.

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.560 align:middle line:84%

I lived for awhile was over

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:19.200 align:middle line:90%
in Taiwan.

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in Taiwan, not
to be confused with Thailand,

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Taiwan has a very, very
low cost of living.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You can live there, I had
an apartment $100 a month,

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:29.370 align:middle line:90%
included a scooter and internet.

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But you can live in places like
Taipei for $300 or $400 a month

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.410 align:middle line:90%
and then eat out every day.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.740 align:middle line:84%
What's unique about Taiwan
is if you have a bachelor's

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.890 align:middle line:84%
degree from Canada
or the United States

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:43.200 align:middle line:84%
you are guaranteed a job
teaching English over

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.017 align:middle line:84%
there 20 hours a week, and you
can earn about $30,000 a year.

00:58:47.017 --> 00:58:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And then your cost of living,
just a few hundred dollars

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:50.150 align:middle line:90%
a month.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You can put $25,000 a
year in a bank account.

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And my idea was to save up a
couple of years working over

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.240 align:middle line:90%
there and buy rental properties.

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can get two
or three rental properties

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:08.010 align:middle line:84%
you can live easily in a van
for $500 to $1,000 a month.

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can retire
by age 30, 35,

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and just to travel the
world, travel in a van

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and never have to work again.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's my advice to
people who are fairly young,

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is to go that route
so you don't have

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.761 align:middle line:84%

It's-- solitude is a good thing,

bit weird.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.050 align:middle line:84%

which might be a cynical way

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:51.860 align:middle line:90%
to look at it.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.120 align:middle line:84%
But your friends you make
for a few days and then

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.328 align:middle line:90%
you're off on the road again.

00:59:55.328 --> 00:59:56.912 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that can
be really beautiful

00:59:56.912 --> 00:59:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and you make lifelong friends.

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's
very transient.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really longing for
some long-term connections.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think this community
really offers that.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.140 align:middle line:84%
These gatherings are a great
way to make those connections.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But life on the road is about
impermanence and spontaneity,

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and that can be a little
bit of a struggle at times.

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So I like the idea of
resting in between travels,

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and doing it as often as I can.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But also just really
connecting with people

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.447 align:middle line:84%
in my surroundings
a little bit more.

01:00:29.447 --> 01:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> While it opens up a
lot of opportunities,

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
you also lose out on a
lot of opportunities.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to say no to
a lot of relationships,

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
or have someone be
very understanding.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Or a lot of the couples
you see out here

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of the same wants.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I think for me, what
would get me out

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
of it is an opportunity
that I want to say yes

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:49.950 align:middle line:90%
to that gets me out of it.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's several
different classifications

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
doing the van life.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
There's those that are
choosing to do that

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and are very actively engaged
in the world around them,

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.655 align:middle line:84%
either with employment
and income, the way

01:01:03.655 --> 01:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
they dress, the way they take
care of themselves, the way

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.390 align:middle line:90%
they interact with others.

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Those people I think
flourish and do

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
very well walking
into Starbucks or

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:16.847 align:middle line:84%
into any retail establishment,
or going to gatherings.

01:01:16.847 --> 01:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I think the ones that
struggle are the people that

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
are forced into van life
without a choice, who maybe have

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
difficulties
engaging with others

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and being socially
interactive in a way that's

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.240 align:middle line:90%
not confrontational.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think these
people would struggle

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:35.700 align:middle line:84%
whether they're in a van
or living in an apartment

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.930 align:middle line:90%
or in a house.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they're
forced into a van.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And those particular individuals
I think struggle a lot

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
in the van life
world and in relating

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
with what we call "sticks and
bricks" people that judge them.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they view it as being
judged for living in a van.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.610 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's probably not.

01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's due to differences
in attitudes

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and maybe the social--

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
word, is the social ability

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
to relate and be able to
communicate effectively

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
with others.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And they just are not able
to integrate with society.

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:19.915 align:middle line:90%
And the van is irrelevant.

01:02:19.915 --> 01:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to
be where they're at.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:24.492 align:middle line:90%

01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
There's two factors that are
lending themselves to van life

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and the popularity of van life.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.300 align:middle line:90%
One is the internet.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
In the digital age we now
have really good information

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure with Wi-Fi hot
spots and internet access,

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
which allows you to have
location-independent type

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
ability to work
wherever you want.

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
They've coined the
term a few years ago

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
called the digital nomad.

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Now we have all
these digital nomads

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.250 align:middle line:90%
that are traveling the world.

01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But some of them want to have
a place to put more stuff.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't really want to be
as minimalist as a backpack.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So they can still live
a minimalist lifestyle

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and combine that with
the digital nomad.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second
factor is minimalism.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons why van
life is booming is that people

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
are just kind of saying no to
this false dichotomy of having

01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to separate life and earning
money from having fun

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying and doing the
things that you love, right?

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And so more and
more and more people

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
are trying to bring
everything together

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
into one holistic life
that is fun and adventurous

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and also hopefully what
works for you, or for you

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.440 align:middle line:90%
financially.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
In this day and age, so much
of what we want to experience

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.823 align:middle line:90%
is out there, far out there.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And then also there's a lot
of digital experiences, right?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when you bring those
two things together, like,

01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
being anchored in
a place is less

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.530 align:middle line:90%
valuable to our generation.

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I think a lot
of people get into it

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because of the
financial difference.

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:04.665 align:middle line:84%
Compared to renting a
house or owning a house,

01:04:04.665 --> 01:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and it depends where
you live, but it can be

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
astronomically more expensive.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be able
to live without the need

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:15.907 align:middle line:84%
to make all that money,
it gives you hat freedom.

01:04:15.907 --> 01:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even people
like us, who really,

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.470 align:middle line:90%
this is how we vacation.

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have a van
and we had to book hotels

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and eat out every night,
or for every meal,

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
we won't be able to go the
places that we have been

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
or be away from home for
weeks and weeks at a time.

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way for us to be able
to see as much of our country

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
as we can with our budget.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> My take is that alternative
lifestyles are really the thing

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that people are
exploring these days.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And the van life is one
alternative lifestyle.

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think financial
reasons is, I think,

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
an important one, and
freedom is an important one.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And just the ability to just
go out there and explore

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and kind of break
loose for awhile

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is really important to a
segment of the population.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's great.

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I think there's so many
ways of living your life,

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and the van life is one way.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.035 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the biggest thing
is just that the freedom to be

01:05:23.035 --> 01:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
a creative individual and not
feel the pressure of having

01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:28.103 align:middle line:84%
to earn this big income
to afford a house.

01:05:28.103 --> 01:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
appealing to people right now.

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think especially
people our age, you know,

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:34.435 align:middle line:90%
in their 30s, 20s, anyone.

01:05:34.435 --> 01:05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
This is independent of age,
but people are re-evaluating

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:39.750 align:middle line:84%
what success means,
and they're finding

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that they can be happy and
feel successful with less.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.002 align:middle line:90%
And this is one way to do that.

01:05:45.002 --> 01:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%

>> Hold my beer.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.364 align:middle line:90%
Hey y'all, watch this!

01:05:52.364 --> 01:05:53.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:54.634 align:middle line:90%
Uh oh.

01:05:54.634 --> 01:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's a quick check in after
the VanLife Diaries festival

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that we went to
in Victor, Idaho.

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
We had a fantastic time,
interviewed a bunch of people.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I collected 23 interviews
throughout the weekend,

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
which was a large sample
size of the people there.

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And the verdict is, different
strokes for different folks.

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come to van life
for various different reasons,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
whether that be
financial, or adventure.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like the
driving force for all of them

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.932 align:middle line:84%
a theme that keeps
coming out is freedom.

01:06:29.932 --> 01:06:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Freedom from something.

01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Freedom from bills, paying for
rent, or freedom to adventure,

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.840 align:middle line:90%
some form of freedom.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Another pattern that I
noticed in my interviews

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
is that typically people
seem to be doing the van life

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
thing full time for
about a year and a half.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.670 align:middle line:84%
There are people
that just started

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and there are people that
have certainly done it longer,

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
but it seemed like
a year and a half

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the mark
people were hitting

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.930 align:middle line:90%
before they craved stability.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I sort
of drew a parallel

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
between living the van
life and traveling.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of times people,
when they go traveling,

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
they can keep that going
for X amount of time,

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and then they crave just
being back in a stable place.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So a conclusion I
came to surrounding

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that was that people really
do use van life as a way

to see the country.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they get out of college
or high school, they buy a van,

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's just an inexpensive
way to cruise around, see

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the southern United
States, the Northern,

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
check out the Pacific
Northwest, and really get

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.110 align:middle line:90%
to know this country.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the wake of the
festival, Kyleigh and I

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
have been talking about
it repeatedly that we just

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.256 align:middle line:84%
want to travel more and make
more time to be out in nature.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:48.819 align:middle line:90%
Tetons, Yellowstone, June 2018.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Campgrounds are all booked, and
I'd really hate to be in a tent

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:52.960 align:middle line:90%
right about now.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the magic
parts of owning a van,

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.609 align:middle line:84%
because you can get the
best of both worlds.

01:08:57.609 --> 01:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like having
a cabin on wheels.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to camp
if you want to in a tent,

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
but when the weather's
absolutely awful,

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
when it's pissing
rain and hailing,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
you can take shelter
in your turtle shell.

So awesome.

01:10:15.785 --> 01:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So far this summer
we've interviewed

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
dozens of van lifers, people
who live in their vans.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We want to go ahead and
switch it up a little bit

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.020 align:middle line:90%
to get company's perspective.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So businesses who may be
affected by this van life boom.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
We want to see if they've
seen an increase in sales,

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
who's buying their products, and
what they make out of all this.

at home in Tacoma,

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Washington where we backed up
our footage and made sure that

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
it looked good, we hit the road
again to interview some van

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:43.920 align:middle line:90%
companies.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
We plotted a course south
to Fresno, California

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to interview Sportsmobile West
owner, Alan Feld, and his son

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Jonathan.

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Alan is in part responsible
for the camper van

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
as we know it today.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
He's seen all the ins and
outs of vans as they've ebbed

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.050 align:middle line:90%
and flowed throughout the years.

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:00.633 align:middle line:84%
And thus Kyleigh and I thought
he'd have some valuable insight

01:11:00.633 --> 01:11:01.550 align:middle line:90%
to share.

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Sportsmobile.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it
all started here.

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a 1965
Volkswagen. We actually

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
started the company in
1961, converting Volkswagens

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.590 align:middle line:90%
into little campers.

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And then in the mid '60s we
actually went from Volkswagens

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to Ford, Chevy, and
Dodges, and that's

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing now along
with the Mercedes Sprinters.

01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
In 1965, in our government's
wonderful wisdom

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
they put a tariff on these
vehicles from Germany.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Chicken Tax.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess the Europeans weren't
buying chickens from us

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s, so
in retaliation we

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
put a tax on utility vehicles.

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the little van
got caught up in that.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think back in '65 this
van was like $1,800 brand new.

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And they put a
$400 tariff on it.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So we sent one of our
kits, camper kits,

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.627 align:middle line:84%
to a company in Germany
called Westfalia.

01:11:52.627 --> 01:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And you guys are too
young, but if you

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:57.087 align:middle line:84%
remembered in the older
vans, the tops all

01:11:57.087 --> 01:11:58.170 align:middle line:90%
went straight up and down.

01:11:58.170 --> 01:11:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Those are all Sportsmobiles.

01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Just like our tops now on
the Fords and the Sprinters

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.090 align:middle line:90%
go straight up and down.

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:05.970 align:middle line:90%
We have a patent on that.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And then Volkswagen
tops all tilted.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And they did that to get
around our patent, started

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.020 align:middle line:84%
bringing the vans in from
Europe to get around the utility

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:14.820 align:middle line:90%
tariff.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Because now they were RVs,
they weren't utility vehicles.

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So back then we lost all
our supply of Volkswagens,

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and our sales were all
through Volkswagen America.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So we lost our parts coming
in, and our distribution

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:28.800 align:middle line:90%
all went away.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So we went to Ford, Chevy, and
Dodge, and we have sold direct

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:34.690 align:middle line:90%
since 1965.

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
service vans back here.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a
really old Dodge right

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
there, the 1980-something,
probably, maybe early '90s.

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And they brought it in to
have something repaired,

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
something replaced, add
something, add solar panels.

01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That one's from Montana,
that one's from Colorado.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, Ford discontinued
the Econoline van.

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Ford Econoline was
kind of our claim to fame.

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
We did a lot of four wheel drive
conversions and everything.

01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they discontinued
it, we're like,

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, what
are we going to do?

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And luckily Mercedes came out
with their four wheel drive

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.240 align:middle line:90%
that same year.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of saved us.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But people still wanted
the Econoline because

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
of the articulation, the towing
capacity is 10,000 pounds.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So Ford is going to make
what they call their Cutaways

01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:28.340 align:middle line:90%
for the next 8 to 10 years.

01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're making
them for the motor home

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:33.930 align:middle line:84%
market, the ambulance
market, and U-Haul is

01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.830 align:middle line:90%
one of their biggest customers.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we get
this Econoline like this--

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
which, the good news is it's
half price, the bad news is you

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.703 align:middle line:90%
get what you pay for.

01:13:43.703 --> 01:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a
whole lot there.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.412 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you guys have to
build the whole back part.

01:13:47.412 --> 01:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We're building the
whole body on the back end.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you look,
this one's got cherry wood,

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
this one's got the white
wood, this one's got the dark.

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have all different
kinds of colors and--

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:00.150 align:middle line:90%
showroom.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:02.930 align:middle line:90%


01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So we just signed a new deal
with a company back east called

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Quigley Motors, which
is this van here.

01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
This is a Ford Transit, which
is not made by Ford, with a four

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.790 align:middle line:90%
wheel drive.

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So Quigley is converting these
for us for four wheel drive

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
now because some people
want the Ford Transit.

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
They want a gas engine
versus a diesel engine.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the issues with
the diesel engines

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is we sell to a lot
of people that like

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:29.070 align:middle line:90%
to do international travel.

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the ultra-low sulfur
American diesel standards,

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- you can go to a Baja
now because there's some gas

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.410 align:middle line:84%
stations down there that do
have the ultra-low sulfur,

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
but mainland Mexico
doesn't have it.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of countries
in Central and South America

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that don't have it.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
need a gas engine

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to go international travel.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, well this is our classic.

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So that one there is four
inches narrower on the inside.

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
This is our one that's
fiberglass on the back

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that we just built. And again,
we have the same box here.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So over where this all
flips out, flips down.

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And this has got
the light oak in it.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It's got a little
microwave in it.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.790 align:middle line:90%


01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:19.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely gorgeous.

01:15:19.772 --> 01:15:23.209 align:middle line:90%


01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:26.155 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:29.600 align:middle line:90%


01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, my wife and I have
this one with the pop top.

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And we sleep up all the time,
except in two situations.

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:38.120 align:middle line:84%
The first one, if it's
really cold outside

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.528 align:middle line:84%
we'll camp like this, but
when we go to bed at night

01:15:40.528 --> 01:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
we'll lower the top
because now the furnace

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.207 align:middle line:84%
is heating half the space
and it's way more efficient.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And the other time
we sleep down below

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:48.790 align:middle line:90%
is when we're stealth camping.

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:52.052 align:middle line:84%
At the Alani, the Hilton,
the Hyatt, and the Marriott,

01:15:52.052 --> 01:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
we don't put the top up, we
don't put the awning out,

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.680 align:middle line:90%
and I don't barbecue outside.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows
you're sleeping in it.

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But like, Apple, we sold a lot
of people from Apple and Google

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
because the cost of living
in the Bay Area is so high.

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're staying on those
campuses in their vehicles.

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, get up in the
morning, and go to work.

01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean they've got cafeterias
there, they've got gyms,

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.100 align:middle line:90%
they've got showers.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.667 align:middle line:84%
We sell to a lot of doctors
that have to be on call.

01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:21.000 align:middle line:90%
They have to be at the hospital.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Globus community
here has hookups.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're 50 feet
from the front door,

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
but they've got
their own bedding,

01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
people aren't slamming doors all
the time and turning lights on.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting, I didn't
even think about that.

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:36.016 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of traveling nurses,
a lot of traveling radiologists

01:16:36.016 --> 01:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
that travel and sit on other
people's businesses while

01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:42.500 align:middle line:84%
they're gone on vacation
or at seminars and stuff.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Living out of their vans.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
everything with them.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.775 align:middle line:84%
My red van, my wife
calls it my man purse.

01:16:49.775 --> 01:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And every time we go somewhere,
she goes, "Let's take the car."

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I go, "I want to take the van."

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I have
everything with me.

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.262 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if the hotels are
booked because I've got a bed.

01:16:58.262 --> 01:16:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
the restaurants are

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
closed because I have
my own refrigerator,

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I have my own food,
and the best thing

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.690 align:middle line:90%
is we have a portable toilet.

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually get from here
to San Diego 45 minutes faster

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have
to stop three times.

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I do slow to 55, but I
don't have to pull over.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.535 align:middle line:84%
Every time I pull
over it's 15 minutes.

01:17:16.535 --> 01:17:18.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Van life has
grown exponentially.

01:17:18.742 --> 01:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can
put a number on it,

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:23.407 align:middle line:84%
but it's easily
doubled, tripled.

01:17:23.407 --> 01:17:24.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, probably more than that.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.782 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I have a
really percentage number

01:17:26.782 --> 01:17:28.970 align:middle line:90%
to quantify things, but massive.

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean it has just been massive.

01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And just in our business and in
nearby businesses, and people

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
who are involved in
selling parts for vans,

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean every industry
involved with vans

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.520 align:middle line:90%
just seems to be blowing up.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
There are definitely different
reasons for every individual

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.040 align:middle line:90%
why they choose the van life.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest
one is adventure.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.280 align:middle line:90%
They see the possibilities.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our customers
are into the outdoors.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.922 align:middle line:84%
I get people who
ask me all the time,

01:17:52.922 --> 01:17:54.290 align:middle line:90%
"Who is buying these things?"

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, they
see this factory full.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I tell them we're a
year and a half out,

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and they're like,
"Who in the world

01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:59.660 align:middle line:90%
is buying all these things?"

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's like everyone that
is interested in the outdoors.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you like cycling,
do you like skiing,

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.872 align:middle line:84%
do you like photography, do
you like mountain climbing?

01:18:06.872 --> 01:18:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's going to
take you out of the city

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:10.330 align:middle line:90%
and into the outdoors.

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can even go
further now, many people

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.130 align:middle line:90%
stealth camp in the city.

01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:14.113 align:middle line:90%
They'll go tailgating.

01:18:14.113 --> 01:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll use these as just
kind of road trip vehicles

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.840 align:middle line:90%
to take their buddies to Vegas.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's not just like
one individual reason

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.185 align:middle line:90%
to get in a van.

01:18:22.185 --> 01:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
just a multitude.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.210 align:middle line:84%
People use them
mobile dog grooming.

01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
There's just a
million applications

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.244 align:middle line:84%
that a van just fits
really nicely into.

01:18:31.244 --> 01:18:34.166 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:18:34.166 --> 01:18:41.480 align:middle line:90%


01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> In August and September
we visited more companies

01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
operating within the van realm.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
We drove up to
Decked, a business

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.113 align:middle line:84%
that makes pull-out drawers
for trucks and vans.

01:18:49.113 --> 01:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We went to see
VertiRack, a company that

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.510 align:middle line:84%
produces ladders and surf
racks for commercial vehicles.

01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We spoke to Prime Design,
a van accessories brand,

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and Road Shower, the pioneer
of pressurized outdoor road

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.560 align:middle line:90%
showers for adventure vehicles.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I even flew out
to the east coast

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to Manchester, Pennsylvania
to interview Mike and Todd

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Quigley from the
Quigley Motor Company

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:08.060 align:middle line:90%
about why vans are popping.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Time and again we
heard the same things.

01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Business is up,
vans are trending,

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
social media is propelling
the movement forward,

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and vans are
booming because they

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.680 align:middle line:84%
offer people freedom and
adventure in a one size

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%
fits all package.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Curious to know more about
how and why social media has

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
latched on to
hashtag #vanlife, I

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.290 align:middle line:84%
reached out to several
popular internet personas

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
to get a better grasp
on what's going on.

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I was particularly curious how
real van life differs from that

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.340 align:middle line:90%
which you see on Instagram.

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Kristen Bor.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.461 align:middle line:84%
I run the outdoor adventure
blog called BearfootTheory.com,

01:19:40.461 --> 01:19:42.905 align:middle line:84%
where I share information
about the outdoors

01:19:42.905 --> 01:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and try to help people
build the skillset they need

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.443 align:middle line:90%
to have a good time outside.

01:19:46.443 --> 01:19:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I also write about van life.

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I love having the van.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It just makes it so much
easier to work from the road

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and get my job done
and be able to maintain

01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
my career while still having
the flexibility to travel.

01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:02.933 align:middle line:84%
Van life has obviously exploded
over the last few years,

01:20:02.933 --> 01:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
but I think people
have been doing

01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
this for a very long time.

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:07.802 align:middle line:84%
But with Instagram
and the internet

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.510 align:middle line:84%
just more and more
people are finding out

01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:11.020 align:middle line:90%
that this is a possibility.

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think also
the internet has

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
made it easier for people
to take their careers online

01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and be able to work remotely,
which makes living in a van

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
full time more viable for
people because they can actually

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
continue to explore their career
passions while also traveling.

01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I do think Instagram
has a tendency

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.680 align:middle line:90%
to romanticize van life.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:35.260 align:middle line:84%
People are only showing
the prettiest pictures

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
of super clean,
tidy van, which is

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.450 align:middle line:90%
really unrealistic, actually.

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
My van is a mess all
the time because you're

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.810 align:middle line:90%
living in such a small space.

01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think also it can be
tough to people in the van.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So if one person likes it
and the other doesn't, that

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:52.220 align:middle line:90%
can be hard to reconcile.

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know you really
have to communicate a lot.

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think for people who
are doing it as a couple,

01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:58.872 align:middle line:84%
I think they get in to
the van and it maybe

01:20:58.872 --> 01:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
challenges their relationship
in ways that maybe they

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.080 align:middle line:90%
didn't expect.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.257 align:middle line:84%
I also think you're making
decisions all the time.

01:21:04.257 --> 01:21:05.340 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to eat?

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Where you're going to camp?

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.170 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I think constant
decision making can

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
be really challenging
for people who

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
are used to just waking
up, going to job,

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
being told what to do,
and then all of a sudden

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:17.340 align:middle line:84%
you come into the van and you
have like so many decisions

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.570 align:middle line:90%
that you have to make.

01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
That can be hard for people.

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're
not always staying

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.700 align:middle line:90%
at a beautiful campsite.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times
you're staying either

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
at a campground or a Walmart,
or on the side of the road.

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily what
people show on Instagram,

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.730 align:middle line:90%
these beautiful camp sites.

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:37.660 align:middle line:90%
There's some of that.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's also, like,
not beautiful camp sites.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes people
have these expectations

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
about like what van
life's going to be,

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.677 align:middle line:84%
and that everyday is
going to be like the most

01:21:46.677 --> 01:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
exciting day of your life,
where there's a lot of mundane.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Also, you spend a
lot of time driving,

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
you spend a lot of time
looking for good campsites.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I think some people like
the challenges that come with

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.205 align:middle line:84%
it and thrive in those
environments and others don't.

01:22:02.205 --> 01:22:04.095 align:middle line:90%
And so then that sort of--

01:22:04.095 --> 01:22:07.470 align:middle line:84%
in the face of those
challenges it causes stress,

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's not the
point of being out here.

01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
If you get in a van and
all you are stressed then

01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that's not really fun.

01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that I just
thought of as you were talking,

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
so maybe part of the Instagram
appeal is this carefree life.

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get in a van
you realize, well, you know,

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.770 align:middle line:90%
life is still not problem-free.

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to find water,
you have to find a place

01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:32.992 align:middle line:90%
to bunk up for the night.

01:22:32.992 --> 01:22:34.867 align:middle line:84%
You've got to figure
out what the hell you're

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.270 align:middle line:90%
going to do every day.

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So would it be fair
to say that you just

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
trade in one set of
responsibilities for another,

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.480 align:middle line:84%
you don't absolve yourself
of responsibility?

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.633 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot to think
about when you're out here.

01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were just
in Seattle, and there's

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
nowhere to park that feels
really all that comfortable

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:54.690 align:middle line:90%
in Seattle.

01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:56.148 align:middle line:84%
So you're in this
cool city and you

01:22:56.148 --> 01:22:58.530 align:middle line:84%
want to go explore, but then
where are you going to park?

01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
just always things

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
that are on the back of your
mind when you're traveling.

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
tons of responsibility

01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:06.720 align:middle line:90%
that come with a van.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I think cleaning a van is
easier than cleaning a house,

01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:12.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's not like you just--

01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's as
carefree, and doesn't free you

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
from some of the stresses
that you face in daily life.

01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I don't want to make
it seem like it's all negative.

01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I love the opportunities that
van life has presented me with.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of just kind
of thinking about some

01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:31.080 align:middle line:84%
of the challenges that maybe
you don't see on the internet

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and that people aren't
always talking about,

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and maybe what causes some
people to quit like a month

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
or two in that they
maybe didn't expect,

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that's just some
of the causes I think,

01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that that may not sit well with
people once they're actually

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.040 align:middle line:90%
out here.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Is van life here to stay, or
is it a trend that is fleeting?

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I think van
life's here to stay.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have been
doing it since way back when,

01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
when people traveled
in VW buses.

01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And now I think it it's a more
accessible lifestyle to anyone.

01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, you don't have to be
a hippie living in a van

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
to live in a van now.

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You can have a normal
job and maintain a career

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:14.680 align:middle line:90%
from the road.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I think as more
and more people realize

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that like, hey, I can
explore my career passions

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and live in a van,
and it just, it

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
makes you able to think outside
the box a little bit more

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the possibilities
for how you can make

01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
money and still maintain your
freedom from a normal nine

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
to five job, and be able
to travel and work it

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:41.160 align:middle line:84%
all together in a
nice, convenient way,

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I think it's here to stay.

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:48.278 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:24:48.278 --> 01:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%


01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> In October, as our film
production started winding down

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Kyleigh and I continued
reaching out to van people.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.955 align:middle line:84%
We formally interviewed
several new folks,

01:25:03.955 --> 01:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
followed up on
Skype with friends

01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:07.247 align:middle line:84%
that we'd made over the
summer, and repeatedly

01:25:07.247 --> 01:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
started up casual
conversations about van life

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.150 align:middle line:90%
with strangers on the street.

01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:12.710 align:middle line:84%
These additional
dialogues confirmed

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:13.940 align:middle line:90%
what we had already learned.

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The majority of people
who come to live in a van

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
do so because A, the cost
of buying or renting a home

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is a burden in today's
economy, and B,

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
people have the desire
to live adventurous lives

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and travel more while
also putting a stronger

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
emphasis on experiences
instead of things.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I.e, being minimalists.

01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We also discovered that
reasons A and B are not

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
mutually exclusive,
meaning that more often

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
than not vanners come to van
because of both lower living

01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
costs and the higher
likelihood for adventure.

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It's also interesting to
note that at least one fifth

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
of the van lifers that
we interviewed in June,

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:50.030 align:middle line:84%
July, August, and September
ended up selling their vans

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and renting apartments,
remarking that van life wasn't

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:54.080 align:middle line:90%
sustainable long-term.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
While each party had their
own reasons and explanations

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
for why they stopped
van life, common threads

01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:59.580 align:middle line:90%
could be observed.

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Ex-vanners explained that
while living in a van

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
offered certain
benefits, they ultimately

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
found it to be lonely and
craved community, namely friends

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and family, missed their former
routines, stability, careers,

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and lacked an overall
sense of purpose.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
In our conversations
together Kyleigh and I

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
came to agree that van lifers
who tend to thrive on the road

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.080 align:middle line:84%
full time and last past
the year and a half mark

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
are comprised of people who have
a deep love and appreciation

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:25.010 align:middle line:90%
for the outdoors.

01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Such individuals tend to spend
the majority of their time

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
outside already, with
or without a van,

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and thus thrive as
full time road warriors

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
once they acquire
a vehicle that's

01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:35.150 align:middle line:90%
conducive to their lifestyle.

01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:38.420 align:middle line:84%
As for the rest of us, van life
is a fantastic temporary break

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.510 align:middle line:84%
from a stuffy desk job, a
reoccurring mortgage payment,

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and a traditional,
sedentary lifestyle.

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's also a great way to
experience heaps of adventure

01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and see our country
for a year or two.

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:51.440 align:middle line:84%
However, for most of
us, full time van life

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
seems to have big voids and is
not sustainable indefinitely.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Since June 2,
2018, Kyleigh and I

01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
have traveled over 18,000 miles
while working on this film.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.580 align:middle line:84%
12,000 of those miles
were logged criss

01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
crossing the Western United
States in our Sprinter van,

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and 6,000 miles were covered
by airplane and rental car.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Over the span of
summer and fall we also

01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:15.080 align:middle line:84%
interviewed 40 plus
people in-depth about vans

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and informally spoke
to at least 40 more.

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Throughout our
conversations we learned

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that vans are
increasing in popularity

01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:22.460 align:middle line:90%
for several different reasons.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And the first reason
is flexibility.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Vans are a complete
utilitarian package.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They are an RV, and a
truck, and a passenger car,

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.190 align:middle line:90%
smashed into one.

01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Hence, vans offer their
owners complete control over

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.480 align:middle line:84%
how they are
customized and used.

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to start a mobile
acupuncture or chiropractor

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.800 align:middle line:90%
business?

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
No problem, you can do that.

01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a big family and
want to see all 50 states?

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Easy peasy.

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.200 align:middle line:90%
And the list goes on and on.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what your dream
is, if it requires a vehicle

01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:49.580 align:middle line:90%
a van fits that bill.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Secondly, vans are economical.

01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
As the cost of living
continues to increase,

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
many people choose
to or are forced

01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.340 align:middle line:84%
to get creative about how
they exist on this earth.

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Vans are a viable
solution because they

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
enable folks to maintain
a high standard of life

01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:04.460 align:middle line:90%
without the homeless stigma.

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
By skipping a traditional
home and moving into a gas

01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
efficient mini bus, van dwellers
can save thousands of dollars

01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:11.390 align:middle line:90%
every month.

01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
This in turn takes a
lot of the pressure

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
away from having to bust
your hump at a job you hate.

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:18.422 align:middle line:84%
When life costs less,
you have to work less.

01:28:18.422 --> 01:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
to work less, you

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.700 align:middle line:84%
have a lot more free time to
do that which makes you happy.

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Thirdly, vans offer
people freedom.

01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And freedom, as we all know, is
heavily prized in our culture.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.620 align:middle line:84%
For some people, freedom
equals liberation

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.860 align:middle line:84%
from bills and the 40 hour
work week, which ties directly

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
into the point that I just made
about vans being economical.

01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But for others, freedom has
more to do with spontaneity

01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and adventure, and
vans are just as good

01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
as spontaneity and adventure
as they are at saving money.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
When you hit the road
in a decked out van,

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you never have to book a
hotel or make a reservation

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:50.900 align:middle line:90%
at a restaurant.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You can decide to stay somewhere
for an extra day or leave a day

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.440 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.023 align:middle line:84%
And you get to bring the comfort
of your home wherever you go.

01:28:57.023 --> 01:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
A van is like a turtle
shell, providing you

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
with most of your necessities
wherever and whenever

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.180 align:middle line:90%
you need them.

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.663 align:middle line:84%
And if this isn't freedom,
I don't know what is.

01:29:05.663 --> 01:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of this
project Kyleigh and I

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.890 align:middle line:84%
set out to determine
why vans are booming.

01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we were
successful in this venture

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and determined that vans are
trending for the three reasons

01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.280 align:middle line:90%
that I just discussed.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Flexibility,
economy, and freedom.

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:22.580 align:middle line:84%
As for whether or not vans are
the new American dream, for me

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.900 align:middle line:90%
the jury's still out.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they are,
maybe they're not.

01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
What is the American
dream anyway?

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it the white picket fence?

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Is it the husband and wife,
or the 2.5 kid family?

01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:35.000 align:middle line:84%
After pondering on this
concept for many months

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I've come to realize that the
idea of any one thing being

01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the American dream
is preposterous.

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
There are roughly 300 million
people in the US alone,

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and each one of those people has
their own unique idea of what

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.040 align:middle line:90%
their dreams and wants are.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Sure, some people want a more
traditional cookie cutter

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.080 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle, but others
rebel against this

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and strive for an
existence that's

01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.990 align:middle line:90%
unique to their own values.

01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And van life is no different.

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
For some people
exploring the US in a van

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:03.620 align:middle line:84%
seems like an
idyllic, fun endeavor.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But for others this
type of lifestyle

01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.960 align:middle line:84%
probably seems irresponsible,
claustrophobic, and dreadful.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's absolutely
nothing wrong

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.020 align:middle line:90%
with either of these stances.

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately up to
the individual, to you,

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to decide which American dream
works for you and which one

01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:18.230 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

01:30:18.230 --> 01:30:20.510 align:middle line:84%
For what it's worth, I
still think vans are awesome

01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and I have no plans to get
rid of my van anytime soon.

01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have tons of
new friends that

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.740 align:middle line:90%
feel exactly the same way I do.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:29.220 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Now you know.

01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And last thing that I've
been asking everybody

01:30:33.490 --> 01:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
is if you had to describe vans
and van life in one word, what

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%
would that one word be?

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Gosh.

01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:40.672 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't think
about it too hard.

01:30:40.672 --> 01:30:41.540 align:middle line:90%
You got to just--

01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, freedom.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Possibility.

01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Sustainable.

01:30:44.650 --> 01:30:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Impactful.

01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Extravagant.

01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd say freedom.

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Definitely freedom.

01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Peace, I guess.

01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What does van
life mean to you?

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Sustainability.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Roller coaster.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Life changing.

01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So van life is rewarding.

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not always easy, but
for me the exploration

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity to explore
our lands myself is worth it.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Dogs love it.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's natural.

01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Enlightening.

01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say either the word
is independence or freedom.

01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If I could describe
van life in one word,

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.350 align:middle line:90%
it would be fulfilling.

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:30.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Unfinished.

01:31:30.465 --> 01:31:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Our van's not finished yet.

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit fair that we
don't have running water yet

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:36.700 align:middle line:90%
and we're under-electrified.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:37.500 align:middle line:90%
So.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the idea
would be adventure, for me.

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say "van
life" I say "freedom."

01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to say dirtbag.

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.105 align:middle line:84%
But I don't use that
word very often.

01:31:47.105 --> 01:31:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You can use dirtbag.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Freedom and dirt.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.520 align:middle line:90%
A free dirt bag.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Free dirt bag.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.738 align:middle line:90%
Free dirt bag.

01:31:54.738 --> 01:31:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Exploration, for sure.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:57.465 align:middle line:90%
Explore.

01:31:57.465 --> 01:31:58.950 align:middle line:90%
That's just it.

01:31:58.950 --> 01:32:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Adventure.

01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:04.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:32:04.445 --> 01:32:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Fun.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Simplicity.

01:32:09.896 --> 01:32:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's freedom for me.

01:32:13.230 --> 01:32:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Learning.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Opportunity, really.

01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Freedom.

01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Adventure.

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Pure joy.

01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I would just say freedom.

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I say van life, you say--

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wild.

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say free, but that's
not really how my journey is,

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:37.900 align:middle line:90%
so.

01:32:37.900 --> 01:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%
