There is no need of all this
because you are all this.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So this potential
gives you strength.

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The greatest strength
we can conceive

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.740 align:middle line:84%
in the world that can change
the world in a second.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It takes a flash for us to
grasp this, and all we wish,

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:09.940 align:middle line:84%
all we are after,
then becomes reality.

>> Life is the most important
and beautiful experience that

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.200 align:middle line:90%
we as souls can have.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.770 align:middle line:84%
To live it well, we must learn
to think with our own head,

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:37.800 align:middle line:84%
not to follow any of the
commonplace things the world

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.020 align:middle line:90%
wants to dish out for us.

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Because Saint Paul was right
when he said that, in the end,

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:47.130 align:middle line:84%
only three things will
remain when everything falls,

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest
of these is love--

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.190 align:middle line:84%
the only real thing in
a world of illusions.

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If we understand
what love is,

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:58.790 align:middle line:90%
then we'll understand ourselves.
