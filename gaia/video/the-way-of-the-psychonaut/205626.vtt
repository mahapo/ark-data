But without a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I made bad choices that
harmed my body and others that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:90%

But then we couldn't
get pregnant,

something that requires

just literally changed my life,

would be considered

thousands of high-dose LSD
sessions with his patients.

gained personally

combined with the
experiences of his patients

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
expanded his understanding
of the human psyche.

It stretched beyond the
biographical information

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%

our time in the womb and
during the birth process.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%

included the spiritual nature

of humanity, recognizing
past life experiences

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.495 align:middle line:84%

It was there that Stan
and Christina developed

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
holotropic breathwork, a
breathing technique that

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
could induce powerful
non-ordinary states

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, similar
to an LSD session.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I had to meet Stan.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
On some deep level, I knew he
could help me find my way back

in.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
When I learned he would
be teaching a course,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I signed up immediately.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We're so far talking
about non-ordinary states

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, but I have
been all these 60 years now

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:10%
interested in a
very significant,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:10%
large subgroup of these
non-ordinary experiences

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:10%
for which current psychiatry and
psychology has no special name.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
They are all put in the
category of altered states

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
What it suggests
somehow is that there's

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
a correct way of experiencing
ourselves and the world,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and that in these
states, it's distorted.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:10%
We have to use
this new psychology

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:10%
if we want to use effectively
holotropic states,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.295 align:middle line:10%
if you want to run
psychedelic sessions

00:05:47.295 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:10%
or do holotropic
breathwork or if we

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:10%
want to work with people who
are in spiritual emergency.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I had read about Stan's
theories on how our experiences

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
in the womb affected
our unconscious,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
but to hear him explain it gave
me a whole new understanding.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The experiences-- if
you regress to birth,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
the experiences come
in four patterns.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:10%
I call them perinatal matrices,
basic perinatal matrices.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The first perinatal
matrix relates

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
to the situation
of the fetus still

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
in the womb before the
onset of the delivery.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
This could be pregnancy which
is the result of planning,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
of the parents'
loving expectation.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The mother is
physically healthy, is

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
in emotionally good condition.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
A reliving of that
kind of state would

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:90%
be a very ecstatic experience.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, this doesn't
necessarily happen.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
There are pregnancies
which are a result of rape,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of a one-night stand when
both parents were drunk,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:84%
where the marriage
was broken, the mother

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is abused, physically and
emotionally unhealthy.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The pregnancy could
be so unwelcome

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that there are
attempts at abortion.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility, the
mother is Rh negative,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:84%
the father is Rh positive
so that from the beginning,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
the fetus is being attacked,
immunologically treated

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:90%
as an invader.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Come nine months
plus minus, this

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:90%
is the onset of the delivery.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:84%
First, hormonal
changes, which are then

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
translated into mechanical
contractions of the uterus.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Each contraction compresses
the arteries and interrupts

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
placentary circulation between
the mother and the child,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
which means no supply of oxygen,
no nourishment coming in,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's no removal
of metabolic product.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no resolution for it
because the cervix is not open.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Just contractions of the
uterus in a closed system.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:10%
Now with each
contraction, the cervix

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:10%
is being pulled over the head.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:90%
It's dilating.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
When it reaches
the necessary size,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
then it's the transition
to the third matrix.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The contractions continue
with all the consequences,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
but the cervix is
now open, so there

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
is these laborious propulsions
through the birth canal.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Now there are tremendous
pressures here.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Suffocation and the pain
generate powerful energy,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
which has all the
qualities of sexual energy.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Our first encounter
with sexual energy,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:84%
we were inflicting pain
on another organism.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Another organism was
inflicting pain on us.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't breathe.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
pressures and fear.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
This kind of experience
then can become the basis

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of the development of
various sexual dysfunctions,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
deviations, aberrations,
perversions.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the completion
of the delivery, head first

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:90%
or feet first.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the
umbilical cord is cut.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
From then on, the child exists
as an anatomically independent

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
individual, still biologically,
emotionally dependent,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
then to purgatory with the
end in sight where you are

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
the victim and the
perpetrator and the observer,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and finally culminate in
freedom and a newfound sense

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.744 align:middle line:90%
of connection.

00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
As Stan finished, I remembered
the rebirthing workshop

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd taken at Rajneeshpuram
back in the '80s.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was dropping
into a deep pit that grew

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:90%
more painful as I descended.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Just when I thought
I was going to die,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I burst through into an
ocean of love and light.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell is
best known for his work

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
in comparing mythologies
and religions

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:90%
from cultures around the world.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
He met Stan in the late '60s at
a conference in New York City.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
When Campbell
heard Stan's theory

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
on the four perinatal
matrices, he instantly

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
solved a mystery that had
intrigued him for years.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't understand
how cultures

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.530 align:middle line:10%
from diverse
geographical locations

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:10%
could share the same
death rebirth themes.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:90%
He called it a monomyth.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But when he saw
Stan's presentation,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
he understood that
these cultures

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
were reliving the experience
of their own birth.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The perinatal matrices,
especially the third

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
moving into the fourth,
served as the threshold

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:90%
for the hero's journey.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
The rites of passage that
these cultures developed

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
allowed their initiates to
access unconscious birth

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
memories, face
their fear of death,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and finally free themselves
from a deep maternal dependency.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Birth itself is not
only a rite of passage,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
but is perhaps the universal
rite of passage that we all go

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's through
that experience

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that we come into the
world, knowing deeply

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
that if we are to succeed
in the ongoing actualization

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:84%
of our potentials,
whatever they are

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
as individuals,
throughout the life cycle,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
for however long we live, we
will need to undergo repeatedly

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:90%
similar rites of passage.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Holotropic breathwork
is an experiential approach

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to self-exploration, to
therapy which uses very,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:90%
very simple means.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It uses faster breathing.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
It uses powerful, evocative
music, and also a certain kind

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:90%
of bodywork when it's indicated.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So each individual
will choose a partner.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:10%
One of those people does the
breathing and the other person

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:10%
sits with him or her, and
then they switch roles

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:10%
so that everybody gets
a chance to participate

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:10%
both as a breather and
as what we call a sitter.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>> And we also combine it with
what we call mandala drawings.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And after the session,
they try to communicate

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
what happened to them in
a kind of graphic way.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The second day of the
conference was the breathwork.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
how anxious I felt.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Towards the end of
the three hours,

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I sat up, thinking
that it was over.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It had been a
pleasant experience,

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to tell
the facilitator

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was fine, that she could
take care of the next person.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:90%
But she wouldn't leave.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The minutes stretched on when
suddenly a wave of sadness

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
rolled up from my
belly, and that's

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:84%
when I understood the
meaning of Stan's phrase.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:84%
As long as it takes,
everyone deserves

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
the time for the
process to fully unfold.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Later during the
course, Stan showed

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
slides from his
Tantra presentation.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It was the same theme
that my teachers showed me

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:90%
some 20 years earlier.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, I realized that on
some deep level I wasn't alone.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
There was something universal
about what I'd experienced,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and Stan held the wisdom
I needed to make sense

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of how it all fit together.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:84%
About nine months
later, I learned

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that Christina had
died, and worried

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that Stan might follow her
if there wasn't something

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:90%
to keep him engaged.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
When I learned about the
conference honoring him,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I knew I had to go.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to the Bay Area.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And as Rick Tarnas
has been heard to say,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:10%
where new ideas meet
the least resistance.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>> For over a half century, Stan
Grof has fully engaged and then

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:10%
participated in the great
transformation of worldview

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:10%
that is taking place in our era.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:10%
>> He was my mentor, fellow
explorer of new visions,

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:10%
co-presenter at many seminars,
and guide in experiential

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:10%
therapies.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:10%
>> At 75 years ago, Stan and
I were kind of conspiring

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:10%
to attack the non-ordinary
state of consciousness.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:10%
>> When I finally overcame my
qualms and moved from semi-hard

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:10%
drugs to psychedelics and
started having LSD experiences,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:10%
which were the most amazing
things I'd ever had.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:10%
>> It was a very different--

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Here were all these
accomplished people,

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:10%
and the one thing they had
in common was an experience

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:10%
of non-ordinary states
of consciousness.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:10%
I'd always imagined that
people who did psychedelics

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:10%
remained hippies for life.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
mainstream news

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.273 align:middle line:84%
warnings of irreparable
damage from using LSD?

00:15:29.273 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:10%
But the presenters
were some of the most

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:10%
accomplished and insightful
people I'd ever heard.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Stan offered them a
context that they in turn

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:10%
expanded and shared.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Stan developed
these descriptions,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:10%
described exactly--

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in detail some of
the most gruesome experiences

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:10%
that I'd had that where I was
in a medieval torture chamber

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:10%
being beaten to death by guys
with their enormous clubs

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:10%
to a bloody pulp.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:10%
And I thought,
well, how does this

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:10%
relate to my Oedipus complex or
anything else for that matter?

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:10%
>> For me personally and many
who spoke and many who are

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:10%
in this room, just going
near Stan changes your life.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> During the event,
Christina was honored for her

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:90%
contributions as well.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
She introduced Stan to
muktananda, contributed

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to the development of
holotropic breathwork,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and together they created an
approach to spiritual emergence

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
when suppressed memories
and emotions spontaneously

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
rise to the surface.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:10%
Their technique helped
people avoid hospitalization

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:10%
and misdiagnosis.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Christina also
shared her struggle

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
with Kundalini awakening
and alcoholism,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
which helped others
find resolution

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:90%
with their challenges.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And I could more than relate
to her feelings of insecurity

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
around so many accomplished
academics and professionals.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The next day was the
workshop designed

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:90%
to support the Grof foundation.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget how
frightened I felt. Here

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:84%
I was, an outsider
among people who

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:84%
knew Stan and had been studying
or working with him for years.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But I found my
courage and suggested

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that the best way to
share Stan's research

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
about the healing power
of non-ordinary states

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness was to
make a movie about him.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
>> This is my favorite
sculpture here.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So have you seen
like the helicopter?

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:10%
You have a flight, and then
you have a ship, and then

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:10%
wheels at the bottom.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:10%
So it's protection against
any kind of transportation

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:10%
that can be involved.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> As I set up my equipment
for the first interview,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't help thinking,
who was I to interview Stan?

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I felt so open and
clear-headed in his presence,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
as though I had access to
information that wasn't

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:90%
available to me on my own.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
What took me by surprise was
Stan's incredible kindness

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:90%
and generosity.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Almost immediately,
we dove into his past.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Stan grew up in
Czechoslovakia, just

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
before the outbreak
of World War II.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
His early childhood was
relatively peaceful,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
but the threat of
a Nazi occupation

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
became a reality when the
German army invaded in 1939.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Stan was eight years
old when Nazi soldiers

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:84%
invaded Prague and forced
Czech citizens to surrender.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
For six years, Stan was exposed
to their sadistic cruelty,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
including the brutal retaliation
after the assassination

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
of SS officer Reinhard Heydrich,
Hitler's third in command.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Known as the architect
of the Holocaust,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Heydrich had been sent
to Prague to wipe out

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:90%
defiance of German rule.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
On May 27, 1942, Heydrich was
attacked by Czech resistance

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
fighters and died from his
injuries a few days later.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The Nazi retaliation lasted
more than three months.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The neighboring villages
of Lidice and Lezáky were

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:90%
destroyed.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:10%
Most of the adult population
was murdered, while all but

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:10%
a few children disappeared.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Stan was 12 years
old at the time

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and remembers the continuous
executions leading up

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to the death of the resistance
fighters who'd killed Heydrich.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a terrifying period
for the entire country.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, when the
war ended in 1945,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Czechoslovakia was restored
to its pre-war boundaries

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and enjoyed a
peaceful existence.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But just three years
later, with the support

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet Union, the
communists took over.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:10%
Two Czech national heroes died
under suspicious circumstances,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:10%
and once again a shadow
spread over Czechoslovakia.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Stan was 17 when he was
accused of possessing

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
a leaflet encouraging people to
challenge the Communist Party.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> After school it was 1
o'clock, and the bell was

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:90%
ringing.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And I opened the door, and there
were two men in leather coats

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and just broke in.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And they just completely
ransacked the apartment.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan was arrested and held
in prison for four months.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, his first experiences
with non-ordinary states

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness happened
during a two-week period

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.550 align:middle line:84%
of disrupted sleep
and interrogations.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And basically, we had to
go through our biography,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:90%
the whole life from childhood.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we were sent
back to the cell.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know if they would
come back in another 20 minutes

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
or if we'll be able to
sleep the rest of the night.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
As I was talking
about the childhood,

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I started actually seeing
scenes from my childhood.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
What was really interesting
was in spite of the very, very

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
difficult situation,
I started realizing

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
about it that I enjoyed.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's something of a
miracle that he ever made it

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:84%
into medical school after
that, but a two-month stint

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
on a student brigade was the
first in a series of events

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:90%
that turned it around.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, our task was to
remove the rock from one side

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
to another so that there
was a space for a highway.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And they really didn't
have any other way

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:84%
of finding out how we
were and by giving them

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the count of the wheelbarrows
that we sort of transferred.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
possibility of cheating.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Fellow classmates who had
joined the Communist Party,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
despite their lack of
commitment to party beliefs,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
tried to protect Stan by
giving him an award for his

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:84%
outstanding work and exceptional
relationship with the working

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
class.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Stan was later
assigned to a school

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
filled with students from
labor and farmworker families.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
As the school's director was
recovering from a heart attack

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
when Stan was admitted, he
failed to read Stan's file

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and recommended him for
a presidential gold medal

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:90%
for his exceptional studies.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So when the medical
school's admission staff

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
read Stan's file,
they saw that he'd

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:84%
been acquitted for
lack of evidence,

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
but that he'd also been honored
as an outstanding laborer

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and awarded a gold medal
by President Gottwald.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And so Stan was admitted
to medical school.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, when I was a student
working in psychiatry that was

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:10%
in the psychiatric
clinic in Prague,

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:10%
there was a lot of very drastic
therapeutic methods that were

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:10%
being used.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I graduated,
I was working

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:90%
in a psychiatric hospital.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And as a newcomer, as a sort
of freshly baked psychiatrist,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I had to get up early and
give the electroshocks

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:33.075 align:middle line:84%
and the insulin comas, up to
25 electroshocks and 15 insulin

00:23:33.075 --> 00:23:33.875 align:middle line:90%
comas.

00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> From the late
1920s to the 1950s,

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
insulin comas were used
to treat schizophrenia.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.410 align:middle line:84%
After an insulin
injection, patients

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
might perspire heavily.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Many salivated profusely.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
would contort in spasms.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Once a profound state of
unconsciousness was reached,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:90%
a nasogastric tube was inserted.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Bile was drawn to verify the
correct placement of the tube,

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and then a glucose
solution was administered.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Archival films depict
patients waking

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:90%
to feel energetic and hungry.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The procedure had a
mortality rate of one in 100.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Stan induced 15
insulin comas a day.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Electroshock therapy began in
the late 1930s from the belief

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that artificially
induced convulsions

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:90%
could cure mental illness.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Electrodes were placed
on a patient's temples

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:84%
while an electric current
passed through them.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The resulting convulsions
were strong enough

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to cause broken bones if the
patients weren't restrained.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Curare derived from
South American plants

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
was later used to
paralyze motor nerves

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and lessen the convulsions.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Stan administered 25
electroshock convulsions daily.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Even psychoanalysis proved
disappointing for Stan.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I was in
psychoanalysis for seven years.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And when in the fourth year I
started bringing in my dreams

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:84%
images that were related
to the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:84%
this was considered to
be relatively successful

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:90%
psychoanalysis.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Fortunately for Stan,
Sandoz Laboratories needed help

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:10%
exploring applications for a
new drug synthesized by Albert

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Hoffman, Lysergic Acid
Diethylamide, or LSD.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The Swiss scientist was
revisiting his synthesis

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
of the ergot fungus
when he accidentally

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.940 align:middle line:90%
intoxicated himself.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:84%
A drop of the clear
solution touched his finger

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and was absorbed into his
system when he wiped his eye.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued by the
unusual sensations,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Hoffman decided to
try a tiny dose.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
A few days later, what followed
was an endless bike ride

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
home and a call for
a doctor when Hoffman

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:90%
thought he might be dying.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Once the crisis passed,
Hoffman realized

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that his discovery was
an incredibly powerful

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:90%
psychotropic substance.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1954, we got a
sample of ampules of LSD.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
They got an idea
that it might be

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:84%
something interesting for
psychiatrists, psychologists.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And would we want
to work with it?

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So my preceptor did
not have the time

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to spend six to eight
hours with people on LSD.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.075 align:middle line:84%
And so he used several
of us as gophers.

00:26:25.075 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
We were sitting
there and taking care

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
of the experimental subjects
and keeping records.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But in that early stage,
students were excluded.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So I had two years
when I was listening

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
to these incredible
stories and not being

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:90%
able to have the experience.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So just about the
first thing I did

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
when I graduated was to
have this experience myself.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
My teacher was specifically
interested in training

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
the brainwaves, which
means exposing people

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to powerful stroboscopic
light of various frequencies

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and finding out if you can
influence the brainwaves

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:90%
in the suboccipital area.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So those of us who
wanted to have a session,

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
we had to agree that
we also would be

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:90%
going through this experiment.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
When my own experience
was culminating,

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
a research assistant took
me to a very little room,

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and then she brought
this gigantic strobe.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
moment, there was light

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
like I had never
seen in my life.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness was
catapulted out of my body.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I lost the research assistant.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:90%
I lost the clinic.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:90%
I lost Prague.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I lost the planet.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I had the feeling that I
was completely extinguished.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I ceased to exist in the
form in which I knew myself.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I had the
feeling that I somehow

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:90%
became all of existence.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I became nothing, but
if I became nothing,

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.546 align:middle line:90%
I became everything.

00:27:57.546 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.665 align:middle line:84%
I was in the
astronomical universe,

00:28:03.665 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:90%
or I was the universe.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are things happening
for which at the time

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even have a name.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But later, I read
about the Big Bang

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and the black holes and the
white holes and wormholes.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It was just an amazing
cosmic spectacle.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And then she turned it off.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness
started shrinking again.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I became myself.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But there was a problem, because
I ended up finding the planet,

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
finding the clinic,
finding my body.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But my consciousness was kind
of floating around the body,

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't find ways
of aligning those two.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
At that point, it was
absolutely clear to me

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that what they taught
me at the university,

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is somehow created

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
by the activity of the
neurons in the brain, suddenly

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:90%
it's totally absurd.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It was clear to me
that consciousness

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:90%
was a cosmic phenomenon.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Could matter bouncing off
atoms or subatomic particles

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
create all that we see,
including the beauty of nature,

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of the universe,
the intelligence that you

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.480 align:middle line:84%
see in animals, that
you see in people?

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Is it really something that can
create science and philosophy?

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:90%
When you see it, it's absurd.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.905 align:middle line:84%
There is a beauty and there is
an intelligence which cannot

00:29:23.905 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:90%
come out of matter.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Then I came down
from this session.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm now stuck
with psychiatry,

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
this is by far the
most interesting thing

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I could do, studying
these non-ordinary states.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> At a complex of research
institutes near Prague,

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Stan was involved in laboratory
testing of LSD and other

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
substances such as
psilocybin and mescaline.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:84%
40 test subjects, a mix
of healthy individuals

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatric patients, would
undergo hourly blood draws,

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:84%
urine samples, and psychological
and neurological testing

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
during their sessions,
all in the hope

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:12.870 align:middle line:84%
of identifying the chemical
source of mental illness.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the initial excitement
was that LSD can produce what

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
we called experimental
psychosis.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:84%
We can give it to quote,
unquote, "normal people."

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We can do all kinds of tests
before, during, and after.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And we get an idea of what's
happening biochemically

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
when the cycle is so
profoundly influenced.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And this was fascinating,
because we are talking

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:90%
about microscopic amounts.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Hundred millions of
a gram can change

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
profoundly human consciousness
for six to eight hours.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:84%
If this is the case,
mental diseases,

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:84%
it would be aberrations
of chemistry.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Now if we could identify
this chemical culprit,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
we could also find some
kind of neutralizing agent.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And this would have been my test
tube solution of schizophrenia

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and other psychosis.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
This would be like the
Holy Grail of psychiatry.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But during the testing,
it became clear that it was

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
impossible to predict the kind
of experience subjects would

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:84%
have, regardless of what
psychedelic they took.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the same subject could
have dramatically different

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:84%
experiences while taking
the same substance

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:90%
on different occasions.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is not the
way pharmacology works.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
You have a pretty good
idea what response

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:84%
you would get with antibiotics
or whatever substance

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.070 align:middle line:90%
we are talking about.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We are dealing with a catalyst,
and that the content is

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:84%
not produced by the
substances, but that it's

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
released from the deep
unconscious realms

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that current psychiatry and
psychology does not know about.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when it comes, they
think it's pathological.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't see it
as something that's

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:90%
germane to the human psyche.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I started seeing it
as a telescope or a microscope.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:84%
With a telescope, we can
see galaxies that we cannot

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.850 align:middle line:90%
normally study.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.210 align:middle line:10%
With a microscope, you
discover an enormous microworld

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:10%
that is here, but we
are not aware of it

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.390 align:middle line:10%
unless we have the proper tool.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So then I took it from the
laboratory to clinical practice

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and started seeing
it as something

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that's going to deepen and
intensify psychotherapy.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> During this period, Stan won
a competition with a paper he

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:90%
wrote about his realizations.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The prize earned
him the directorship

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of the psychedelic program at
a newly built research center.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the
laboratory testing,

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:84%
subjects in the clinical
tests had a broad range

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of experiences, including
blissful and ecstatic ones.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And even emotionally
challenging experiences

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:84%
were soothed as the session
ended and memories that

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.980 align:middle line:90%
had surfaced were resolved.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Stan even noted that
the clinical sessions

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:84%
seemed very similar to
classic psychotherapy.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:90%
But over time, patterns emerged.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The contents of the
unconscious were not stored

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in the form of kind of
disconnected mosaic,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
but they were forming certain
dynamic constellations.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:10%
Certain issues were
appearing on different levels

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:10%
at different times
of their biography,

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:10%
and they were creating
these dynamic packets that

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:10%
were connected with the
same type of emotions

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:10%
or physical feeling.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they would have
a choking constellation.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
They would be near drowning
when they were seven

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and being choked by an older
brother repeatedly when they

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.250 align:middle line:90%
were four, then whooping cough.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But then the deeper level
was the choking at birth.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So I started talking about these
constellations, COEX systems.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to the
understanding of COEX systems,

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Stan observed how the
experiences of his clients

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
evolved dramatically during
a series of sessions.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Only the early sessions
seemed to have the nature

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:84%
of the experiences that I
knew from psychoanalysis.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But then sooner or
later, even if we

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
are using sort of
just medium dosages,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
people started talking about
being in a place where they

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:84%
felt their life was threatened,
that they're going crazy,

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
they will never get
out of that state.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
They started having experiences
of choking or nausea.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And then one after
another told me

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that they believed that
what they are experiencing

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:90%
must be a reliving of birth.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, I
decided to test this.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I took 300 micrograms
on my own at home.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Within an hour, I was in a
very, very difficult place.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:84%
On the wall, I had a painting,
some type of painting.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was one which was like
a stylized dog with a soldier.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.530 align:middle line:84%
They started
fighting, and then I

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:84%
had the feeling that everything
was kind of closing in.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly,
I was in something

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that I now call the
second perinatal matrix.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It was like a space where it
seemed absolutely hopeless.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Very, very uncomfortable
emotionally.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I started feeling
a pressure on my head.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was somehow
stuck in the birth canal,

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and all my life appeared to
be absolutely meaningless.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing the deep truth
in existential philosophy.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%
You know, life is absurd.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.140 align:middle line:90%
We go from nowhere to nowhere.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
We start life as
infants in pain,

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and this is how we
are going to end.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But even if I knew that
this was birth, then

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:84%
somehow the thought came
that this state would not end

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:90%
unless I find meaning in life.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
well, it's knowledge.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I saw myself
going to libraries,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
devouring one book
after another.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it took me
to the end of my life

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
where I couldn't remember
what I had for dinner,

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
let alone what I read
in all those books.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
well, having children

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:90%
gives meaning to your life.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like, well, you
don't give meaning to your life

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
by creating creatures whose
life is as meaningless as yours.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And then after
some time, it just

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
sort of very rapidly
opened up, and suddenly I

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.630 align:middle line:90%
was in a very ecstatic state.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, you cannot
find meaning in life using

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:90%
your reason.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:84%
This was a very important
first experience.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It suddenly showed me whole
new potentials of psychedelics.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Through his own experiences
and those of his patients,

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Stan learned that lower
doses brought up biographical

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.040 align:middle line:84%
information while higher ones
brought patients much farther.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
He also noted that something
fascinating was happening.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was hitting
some difficult places,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a parade of my patients,
and I suddenly understood where

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
they were including the
meaninglessness and even

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.500 align:middle line:90%
suicidal impulses.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Equipped with current
psychiatry, I just had no clue.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The only way was
experiential learning.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.180 align:middle line:84%
You cannot learn from books
what these patients are going

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Without the distraction
of constant testing and with

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:84%
higher doses of LSD, Stan's
clients were encouraged to go

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:90%
inward.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
To Stan's surprise, they
kept journeying back

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.600 align:middle line:90%
to the perinatal realm.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not easy to really
question some of the really

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:90%
fundamental assumptions.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
personal experience

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that made it even worse.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I went as a second year student
to a lecture of Professor Vilém

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Laufberger.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, how far
back does our memory go?

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Can we, for example,
relive our birth?

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me like
I was a total asshole,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:90%
and said, of course not.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the cortex
is not myelinized.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody was laughing,
so I was pretty shamed.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So I had that kind
of additional memory,

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
like this was really
stupid to think

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that you could
relive your birth,

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:84%
even if it seems
very convincing.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But then of course, if
I saw it again and again

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and had a few more
experiences myself,

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I realized that this
edifice of psychiatry

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that looks so respectable is
like a Colossus on clay feet.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> As Stan described
the scientific

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
establishment's reluctance
to accept perinatal memories,

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I remembered my 30 hours
of labor giving birth

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.970 align:middle line:90%
to my daughter, Charlotte.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I eventually needed
help pushing her out.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why she wouldn't
go through those tunnels

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:90%
at the playgroup.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I was so concerned that I
took her to see an osteopath.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The doctor swore that she
wasn't applying any pressure

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:90%
to Charlotte's head.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.600 align:middle line:90%
[BABY CRYING]

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, Charlotte
had no problem

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:90%
going through the tunnels.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:84%
When Charlotte
was 20 months old,

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:90%
we were attacked by two gunmen.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.110 align:middle line:84%
We were living in the
suburbs outside of Paris,

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was four months
pregnant with my son, Oscar.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The first shot missed my
head by about 12 inches,

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and the remaining three
shattered our bedroom windows.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:84%
We escaped unharmed,
but for a month or so,

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake up at night
reliving the experience

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and imagining
where I would hide.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Later, when Oscar was old
enough to play hide and seek,

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.025 align:middle line:90%
no one could find him.

00:39:35.025 --> 00:39:35.825 align:middle line:90%
Oscar?

00:39:35.825 --> 00:39:41.185 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.185 --> 00:39:41.985 align:middle line:90%
Oscar?

00:39:41.985 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It was clear to me now
that my children's behavior

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
had been influenced
either by what

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
had happened while
they were in the womb

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.485 align:middle line:90%
or during their actual birth.

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Mama, I'm going to hide.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Come inside and hide.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to hide.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> How could scientists so
easily dismiss the reality

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.756 align:middle line:90%
of perinatal memories?

00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Come inside and hide.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The usual view about the
mind is that the mind's confined

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.940 align:middle line:90%
to the head.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing but the
activity of the brain.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:34.250 align:middle line:10%
For the materialists who
represent the majority position

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:10%
within academic
life and in science,

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.330 align:middle line:10%
minds are what brains do, and
memories are stored materially

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.170 align:middle line:10%
inside the brain.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all inside the brain.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that's an incredibly
truncated and narrow view.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think
we access our memories

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.100 align:middle line:90%
by morphic resonance.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:90%
They're not inside the brain.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I think that
our consciousness, our minds

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:84%
are not confined to the
inside of our heads,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:84%
but stretch out beyond
and through fields.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
We're all used to the
idea of magnetic fields

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
being inside magnets
and stretching

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond them or the
gravitational field of the Earth

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:84%
being inside the Earth
and stretching out

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:84%
into space invisibly, or
the fields of cell phones

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:84%
being inside the cell phone and
stretching invisibly around it,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:90%
which is why they work.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And all matter now has
fields associated with it.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And of course, the brain does.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It has electromagnetic
fields you can measure

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.820 align:middle line:90%
with an electroencephalograph.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
fields of the mind

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:84%
are much more extensive,
and these extended fields

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:84%
of the mind are a
kind of morphic field.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a field
theory of the mind.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that I realized that
we could hold memories from

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.580 align:middle line:84%
our time in the womb, I
couldn't stop thinking about

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the influence these
unconscious memories might have

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:90%
on our lives.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:84%
One of Stan's clients
showed just how powerful

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:90%
these memories are.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the patient whom
I called Peter came with kind

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of a combination of obsession
and masochistic impulses

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and tremendous need and wish
to be locked in a cellar and be

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:16.000 align:middle line:84%
exposed to some emotional
and physical pain, torturous.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter would search for these
men in parks, train stations,

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.370 align:middle line:90%
and other public places.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And on one occasion, he was
struck on the head and robbed.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The last episode occurred
when Peter was on a train

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.410 align:middle line:84%
with a man who claimed to
have the perfect cellar

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:34.720 align:middle line:90%
to satisfy his obsession.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.730 align:middle line:84%
When the man got up
to use the toilet,

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Peter gave in to his gnawing
doubt and opened the man's bag.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Horrified by what
he found, Peter

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:48.050 align:middle line:84%
jumped from the moving train
and ended up in the hospital.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:84%
When psychiatric treatment
failed to help him,

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.240 align:middle line:84%
he was sent to Stan where
he underwent a series

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:90%
of high-dose LSD sessions.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>> A very, very interesting
COEX system emerged in a series

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.340 align:middle line:90%
of sessions.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:84%
The most superficial layers were
actually the traumas that he

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:90%
himself created.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Then as we continued, another
layer of the COEX system

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.990 align:middle line:84%
emerged, which was from
the Second World War

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:18.020 align:middle line:84%
when he was taken
to Nazi Germany.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a
situation where there was

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:90%
a great danger of bombardment.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Two of the SS officers
were using him

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.410 align:middle line:84%
for their homosexual practices,
initially under gunpoint.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it went
to his childhood

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:84%
when his father, who
was an alcoholic,

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.280 align:middle line:84%
was very, very brutal
and used to beat him

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:90%
with a leather strap.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And his mother, who
actually always wore black,

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.890 align:middle line:84%
punished him repeatedly by
locking him in a dark cellar

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:50.290 align:middle line:90%
and leaving him without food.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So on that level,
it seemed like it

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.780 align:middle line:84%
was a combined punishment
from the two parents

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.440 align:middle line:90%
that he was seeking.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it ended up
in a situation where

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:84%
he was stuck in the
birth canal and realized

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that was the template
of the situation

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.340 align:middle line:90%
that he was searching for.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But when he actually
experienced that,

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.830 align:middle line:84%
he got more than
he bargained for.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Stan had previously
experienced the kind of death

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:84%
rebirth process Peter
underwent, he was not fearful

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.940 align:middle line:84%
for Peter's safety, and
could allow the full process

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.350 align:middle line:90%
to unfold.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:84%
After that session, Peter
was finally liberated

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.930 align:middle line:84%
from his
self-destructive impulses

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and able to live
a productive life.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Around the time Stan
was working with Peter,

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.640 align:middle line:84%
he traveled to Amsterdam
for a conference on LSD

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.260 align:middle line:90%
psychotherapy.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Pauline McCririck
and Joyce Martin

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.790 align:middle line:84%
were two psychoanalysts
who were actually

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:84%
using LSD and doing what
they called fusion therapy.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Clients who were deprived in
their childhood of being held

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:84%
would lie with
full-body contact.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And they had amazing
results with this.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.930 align:middle line:84%
We were both in
Amsterdam, and so we

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.210 align:middle line:90%
decided to have a session.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:84%
As part of my last
perinatal session,

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I got into this atmosphere
of bloody revolutions.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of it, I
really identified with Lenin.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I shared his passion
against oppression.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
part of it was a czar,

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.060 align:middle line:84%
but a good part of it was the
compression of the birth canal.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of atmosphere
of revolutions and struggling

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.530 align:middle line:84%
for birth somehow
completely fused.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
there's a relationship

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.200 align:middle line:84%
between historical events
like wars and revolutions

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and what we carry at the
perinatal level, possibly even

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:46.150 align:middle line:84%
something that is a source
of that kind of violence.

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But then the
session ended, and I

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.400 align:middle line:84%
went through the whole
range of relationships

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:84%
with women, the destructive
feminine that comes in bursts.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.690 align:middle line:84%
The adventure, the exciting,
like a sexual partner.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the feeling of
being an infant on her body.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The transition from the
third matrix into the fourth

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:84%
was like emergence
out of in fire.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.610 align:middle line:84%
There was like a goddess with
dark complexion and a peacock

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:14.370 align:middle line:90%
paradise or heaven.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very
blissful experience.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But she became like a
great mother for me.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan's session with
Pauline in Amsterdam revealed

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal nature of the
birth experience during which

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.890 align:middle line:84%
the fetus is exposed to a
collective dimension filled

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.320 align:middle line:84%
with powerful
imagery and emotion.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But a newborn lacks
the capacity to make

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.440 align:middle line:84%
sense of what is witnessed,
and so these impressions remain

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.500 align:middle line:84%
in the unconscious,
influencing us in ways

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.655 align:middle line:90%
that we don't realize.

00:46:42.655 --> 00:46:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the great
contributions of Stan's work is

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that he uncovered
the deep structure,

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.220 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal
pattern, you might say,

00:46:54.220 --> 00:47:00.450 align:middle line:84%
of the life process as it is
incarnated and reincarnated

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.880 align:middle line:90%
in us as individuals.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When Stan discovered the work
of Lloyd deMause and the field

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of psychohistory, he noted the
parallels between the imagery

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:14.950 align:middle line:84%
used to goad people to war and
experiences that he and his

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.650 align:middle line:84%
patients had during
their sessions.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.770 align:middle line:10%
It became clear to Stan that
these unconscious memories

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:10%
of helplessness from the second
matrix and anger from the third

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.380 align:middle line:10%
were driving factors
in the need for power.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This need for
control was clearly

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.580 align:middle line:84%
evident in the book
"A Sexual Profile

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of Men in Power," which detailed
a seven-year study of call

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.840 align:middle line:84%
girls and madams whose primary
clients were politicians

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.840 align:middle line:90%
and government officials.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.390 align:middle line:84%
The study found that
over 50% of those men

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:84%
regularly hired prostitutes,
and more than half of them

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.600 align:middle line:84%
demanded kinky or
sadomasochistic sex

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:84%
as a means of coping
with the powerlessness

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that they experienced
in government.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Nine months in a total
dependence on the maternal

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:00.650 align:middle line:90%
organism.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Then there is this incredible
roller coaster of birth

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that we are taken
through, and then

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.140 align:middle line:84%
emerging in a total
dependence on the mother.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It leaves a very deep
fear of the feminine

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in the male psyche, and
frequently a clumsy effort

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.620 align:middle line:84%
to compensate for it, not
giving women the same rights,

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.040 align:middle line:84%
not to treat them as
equal citizens, and so on.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.200 align:middle line:10%
Women go through that
also, but because

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:10%
of their physiological function,
because of their anatomy,

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.320 align:middle line:10%
they are able to
participate directly

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.420 align:middle line:10%
in the process of creation.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The male participation
is very marginal.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It can take a few minutes,
and then it's over.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The way to resolve
traumatic unconscious memory

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:84%
would be if that material fully
emerges into consciousness,

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:50.960 align:middle line:90%
which will be therapeutic.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.610 align:middle line:84%
What can happen
in everyday life,

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:56.180 align:middle line:84%
it comes close to the surface,
but that person does not

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.220 align:middle line:90%
realize what it is exactly.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But they feel the need to
create a situation that

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.080 align:middle line:90%
would involve those elements.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example, that
transition from the third

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to the fourth matrix frequently
is experienced as fire.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I worked with some people
who were arsonists,

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and they had this impulse.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They felt that
something fantastic

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.500 align:middle line:84%
would happen if they could
experience a big fire.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
they watched it

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and feel excitement for a
while, but it is a real letdown.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.050 align:middle line:84%
They expected something
much more phenomenal.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But the drive can
be strong enough

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:84%
to drive them to do
it again and again.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:39.540 align:middle line:84%
In a very similar
way, the third matrix

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.910 align:middle line:84%
involves a lot of
sadomasochistic kind

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
of experiences where
you feel sexual arousal

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and you feel confined and you
feel sort of choked, and so on.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of unrecognized
healing impulse.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But for it to be
therapeutic, it would

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:84%
have to involve
introspection, understanding

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
what you are dealing
with, and really

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:84%
be fully consciously in
touch with the material.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing the conscious mind
can think of will ever satisfy

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:90%
the unconscious.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It has to originate from the
unconscious to be cleared.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.170 align:middle line:84%
After hearing so many
of Stan's stories,

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.300 align:middle line:84%
it was time for me to
find out what shadows

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.670 align:middle line:90%
were lurking in my unconscious.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Would they be as dark
as what Stan had seen?

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And if so, would I have the
courage to confront them?

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Rule number one,
never do this alone.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The sitter is there to
keep you safe, ground you,

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
to hold the space

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:84%
so that you can completely
open to whatever comes.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.070 align:middle line:84%
As the LSD took
effect, there was

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:50.070 align:middle line:90%
a flood of geometric imagery.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
retinal discharge,

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:84%
but now I think I was
seeing fractals or even

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:84%
the dimension that
holds the blueprints

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.110 align:middle line:90%
of the physical world.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Soon it transitioned
into Christina.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, as though I was
seeing through Christina's eyes,

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.500 align:middle line:90%
it was Stan.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a sadness
as she realized

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that she was leaving him.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But then Stan transitioned
into my father and Christina

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.770 align:middle line:90%
dissolved into me.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:84%
The pain was so intense that I
knew it couldn't just be mine.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I actually felt as
though I was choking.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.830 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.860 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I
understood that although I

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.160 align:middle line:84%
might have been triggered by
the pending death of my father,

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I was also tapping into
the collective sadness.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And what a depth
of it there was.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Addiction, drugs, alcohol,
sex, compulsive behavior,

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:07.770 align:middle line:84%
anything to dissolve back into
the formless ocean of love

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and avoid this unbearable
sadness of separation.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It took me two days
to feel whole again.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.500 align:middle line:84%
If it hadn't been
for my kids to think

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.130 align:middle line:84%
about or the sitter
to talk to, I

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:25.880 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I would
have come out of it.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But because I had grieved my
dad's death before he died,

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I was able to listen
to his daydreams

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.590 align:middle line:84%
during those last
weeks of his life.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And when he finally
slipped into a coma,

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to help him
detach from his body so he

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.100 align:middle line:90%
wasn't afraid or in pain.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.460 align:middle line:84%
He lay like that for 28
hours, and then an hour

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.700 align:middle line:84%
before my daughter's last
ballet performance, he died.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I was filming while Charlotte
danced when suddenly I

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:84%
remembered that he had
sat in that theater,

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and I remembered exactly
where he had sat.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:08.660 align:middle line:84%
The memory was so clear
that I realized that I

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.490 align:middle line:90%
was seeing through his eyes.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.920 align:middle line:84%
His spirit was
there in the theater

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.750 align:middle line:84%
to watch his
granddaughter dance.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:30.120 align:middle line:84%
After the performance,
I went to help my mom.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.890 align:middle line:84%
When I had finally
cleaned the space

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:35.370 align:middle line:84%
so that she could remember him
in better health, I went home.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:84%
A few hours later, I
let the tears well up

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and felt myself once again
pulled out by my heart.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But because I knew that
I could survive it,

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I allowed the sadness to
flow, and it felt amazing.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:55.310 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't witnessed
Stan's courage

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and trusted his example,
I doubt any of that

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.490 align:middle line:90%
would have happened.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:03.430 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't afraid to
confront the darkness.

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.350 align:middle line:84%
In 1967, Stan was invited to
continue his research at Johns

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Hopkins University in Maryland.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But pushback
against psychedelics

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
was growing, inflamed by
flawed studies engineered

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.690 align:middle line:90%
to generate fear.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We have children that are
born without legs or arms,

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.050 align:middle line:84%
the kind of thing we've seen
after thalidomide exposure.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though the studies
were eventually dismissed,

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:39.390 align:middle line:84%
the culture was reeling from
the impact of psychedelics.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:84%
As a result, the research
program at Johns Hopkins

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:90%
University was terminated.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately for
Stan, the program

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.730 align:middle line:10%
at Spring Grove Psychiatric
Hospital was still operational.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:52.220 align:middle line:84%
While there, he
continued his research,

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.680 align:middle line:84%
encountering even more
intriguing patients.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a patient who had
some of the most difficult

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.470 align:middle line:84%
pathology, if you want
to call it that way,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:01.820 align:middle line:90%
that I have ever seen.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.620 align:middle line:90%
She was four years in prison.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And while on parole, she
became a multiple drug addict.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.820 align:middle line:84%
She had very difficult
episodes of depression.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
a life decision,

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and so we decided
to take our chances.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So she had two very
powerful sessions.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.770 align:middle line:84%
She was from a family
where there was alcoholism,

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:24.800 align:middle line:84%
there was abuse,
there was incest.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And then in the third session,
suddenly she started crying,

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:30.030 align:middle line:90%
she started screaming.

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And then a vicious
expression in her eyes.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:35.454 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:55:35.454 --> 00:55:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly sort of
evil expression.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And this very deep voice
came and introduced itself,

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.870 align:middle line:90%
himself as the devil.

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And then came this barrage
of insults and threats.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.450 align:middle line:84%
There was information
that the patient as such

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.790 align:middle line:90%
could not have known.

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful nurse
that was a southern Baptist,

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:00.472 align:middle line:90%
and she was shaking.

00:56:00.472 --> 00:56:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought she was
getting a heart attack.

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So I was watching the patient,
and the nurse at one point--

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, this is obviously
the Jungian archetype that's

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.450 align:middle line:90%
manifesting here.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But maybe for that
kind of archetype,

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:84%
the crucifix would
be the best remedy.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:84%
As I was reacting emotionally,
it was just becoming more real.

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So I started
meditating on light.

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I knew that from my
spiritual reading

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that these creatures
don't like light.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, it stopped
the way it started.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything relaxed.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Then as she was coming
down, we sort of

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:41.640 align:middle line:90%
started talking about it.

00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And I realized she
remembered only what

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:45.980 align:middle line:90%
happened before this episode.

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And what happened after, there's
just total amnesia for this.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if I
should sort of bring that

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:56.630 align:middle line:84%
up and talk about it, and I
decided not to do it at all.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.770 align:middle line:90%
But she herself felt wonderful.

00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And then very
shortly afterwards,

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.590 align:middle line:84%
she left the hospital
and probably was a little

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.900 align:middle line:90%
lying on the questionnaire.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:10.670 align:middle line:90%
She got a job as a taxi driver.

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But despite the tremendous
success of his work,

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:16.460 align:middle line:90%
the program lost funding.

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.890 align:middle line:10%
>> We were finding it more
and more difficult to continue

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:19.690 align:middle line:10%
the research.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of material,
so I really wanted a sabbatical

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and do some writing.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And I got an invitation
from several publishers

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:30.410 align:middle line:90%
so I could take a year off.

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a party
in New York City,

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and there was
Michael Murphy there,

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:37.400 align:middle line:90%
the co-founder of Esalen.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When I met Stan first in
'65, he was probably the best

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.840 align:middle line:84%
looking man in the human
potential movement.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was as good
looking as Richard Burton.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, so Stan, what
are you doing these days?

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm
actually taking a year off

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:53.280 align:middle line:90%
to write a book.

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why don't
you come to Esalen?

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It was my instinct as a
director and producer of this

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.160 align:middle line:90%
ongoing theater at Esalen.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.160 align:middle line:90%
He was perfect.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.570 align:middle line:10%
And of course, we had
been right in the middle

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:11.800 align:middle line:10%
of a lot of experimentation
with psychedelics.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And although psychedelics
were not my ally,

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Stan represented not only
another doorway into this,

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.680 align:middle line:90%
but also sobriety.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he actually
thought about it.

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Tim pretended to think
about it, but he just

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.430 align:middle line:10%
proclaimed a vision of
taking LSD every Sunday.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.500 align:middle line:84%
If it's good, just
have more of it.

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And we saw disaster after
disaster during the '60s.

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So Bob Schwartz
gave us some money,

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and Esalen provided a beautiful
house, and off we went.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:52.120 align:middle line:10%
And he became the leading force
in our overall programming

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.060 align:middle line:10%
for most of the
years he was there.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides our
breathwork workshops,

00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.130 align:middle line:84%
we offered then
months-long workshops.

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:02.980 align:middle line:84%
People were coming to Esalen
from all over the world,

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want to
take just one workshop.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.960 align:middle line:10%
So this gave me a
chance to choose

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.200 align:middle line:10%
a topic I was interested
in and see who in the world

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.600 align:middle line:10%
was doing some
cutting-edge research

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.030 align:middle line:10%
and invite those
people, and then

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:20.680 align:middle line:10%
always finding 36 people who
would want to do it with us.

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One popular program combined
vipassana with breath work.

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of a time when
we were holding our large

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:31.450 align:middle line:84%
holotropic breathwork and
Buddhist practice retreats.

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:35.020 align:middle line:10%
And there's a room full of
some hundreds of people,

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:38.230 align:middle line:10%
doing the breathwork
after we had meditated,

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:40.680 align:middle line:10%
going through these profound
openings with this music

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.480 align:middle line:10%
playing.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.725 align:middle line:84%
Some people are in
heavenly states,

00:59:43.725 --> 00:59:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and some people feel like
they're dying and getting

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.670 align:middle line:84%
reborn, and some people
have past life experiences

00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:50.860 align:middle line:84%
or turning into
birds or animals,

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and some people are having the
reliving of their childhood.

00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Every possible thing.

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in
Dante's "Inferno"

00:59:57.490 --> 01:00:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and "Purgatorio" and "Paradiso"
all at the same time.

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's really quite marvelous,
because it's so well held

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and tended by the facilitators.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And then when things get really
dicey, they call Stan over.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So I remember one who was
a multiple personality who

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.650 align:middle line:84%
had different alters that
would show themselves

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.060 align:middle line:90%
at different points.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
was really demonic.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And this whole demonic
side started to come out.

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Like, (SCRATCHY VOICE)
if you come near me,

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I will slash and kill you.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So the facilitators were
a little bit nervous,

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.350 align:middle line:84%
because the voice and the
aggression of this demon--

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
you try to fix or help
me and I will get you

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and I will kill
you and slash you.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:43.420 align:middle line:84%
It was not an easy
person to be tending.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So they called Stan
over, because it

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
seemed like this demon
wanted to eat everybody.

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And Stan came over
very calm and cool

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and sat down and said,
tell me more, you know?

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.200 align:middle line:90%
You're a demon.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.340 align:middle line:90%
You have some powers.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.020 align:middle line:10%
What are those powers you have?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And who do you think you
really are as a demon?

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.097 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you really know
what your identity is?

01:01:04.097 --> 01:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
He didn't probably
ask it in that way.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But he began to look
directly at the demon,

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.207 align:middle line:84%
say, you don't know really
where you come from,

01:01:11.207 --> 01:01:12.040 align:middle line:90%
do you, who you are?

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm very pleased to meet
you, but you don't--

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and the demon started to
get confused and start

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:18.430 align:middle line:90%
to look around.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was like instead of
being afraid of the demon,

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Stan met this demonic energy
with a kind of curiosity

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and interest and fearlessness
that the demon had never

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:29.950 align:middle line:90%
met before.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And it started to
kind of lose its way,

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole
thing morphed.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Magic happened when other
people were frightened.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
That kind of innocence
that Stan has,

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
it's like this giant kid
wandering around, saying, wow.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:51.025 align:middle line:84%
He has this tremendous
appreciation for everything.

01:01:51.025 --> 01:01:57.340 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1974, Stan was about 43
years old, and I was about 24,

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.490 align:middle line:10%
working at Esalen as a
night guard and then writing

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:03.430 align:middle line:10%
my dissertation during the day.

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And we got a call at about
4:30, 4:30 in the morning.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The night guard who was on that
night said, we've got a crisis,

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and we need you guys
here right away.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
1:00 AM to 5:30 every
morning we would

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
let in people from outside
of Esalen to use the baths.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
A young man had taken
LSD with his girlfriend

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and started to flip out at
some point during the session.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Became violently paranoid.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The girlfriend had
escaped from the guy.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
He had gone up the
hill to their van.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
All we knew was that
he's got a knife.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:42.210 align:middle line:90%
He's naked.

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
He's psychotically
paranoid and violent.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
As we're approaching the
van, I'm thinking to myself,

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.160 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is great.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Just because I'm writing
a dissertation on LSD

01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy, I'm now in
a life and death situation.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So Stan opens the
sliding van door.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The bottle is thrown
right by his head.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes in,
picks up a blanket,

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:12.060 align:middle line:84%
wraps it around the man,
and puts him in a bear hug

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:12.990 align:middle line:90%
and says, OK.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.912 align:middle line:84%
You've taken a very
powerful psychoactive drug.

01:03:15.912 --> 01:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you to close your
eyes and pay attention

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on inside you.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.610 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Within about 15
minutes, the young man

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:30.240 align:middle line:84%
was laughing at himself, but
at the same time embarrassed

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
for what he had caused.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It was a real testament to
Stan's personal courage,

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
but it also was an illustration
of his whole philosophy

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of trusting the psyche.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%


01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
The very first
lecture that I ever

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
heard Stan give in
March of 1974 at Esalen,

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I asked him at the
end, what do you

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
do in the case of someone who's
in a really bad trip where

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:02.372 align:middle line:84%
they're descending
into an incessant loop

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that they can't
get out of and they

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're
losing their sanity?

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And these things can have
enduring effects too.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said with a kind
of poetic conciseness

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that I've never
forgotten, he just said,

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
the full experience
of an emotion

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.400 align:middle line:84%
is the funeral pyre
of the emotion.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And he just pointed out that we
have a tendency to, of course,

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
wall ourselves off from
the pain, the scary things

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
in our psyche that
are trying to emerge.

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But he says, that's actually
the way out of the pathology

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.760 align:middle line:90%
of the suffering.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to convey
with that one sentence

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the idea that bad trips and
negative material, which

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Tim Leary did not
prepare the masses for,

01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
were actually a royal road
to transformative healing.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's essential when
we discuss psychedelics now

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
challenging experiences,

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and that it's not all easy.

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
MAPS does psychedelic harm
reduction at Burning Man

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and at festivals
all over the world.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of our main
principles is "difficult

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.760 align:middle line:90%
is not the same as bad."

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
with psychedelic therapy

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
right now we prepare people
in a much different way

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and really talk about a lot
of the kernels of wisdom

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
will come wrapped in these
very difficult experiences.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan recognized early on that
existing schools of psychology

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
couldn't explain the profound
experiences and resulting

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
transformations that he
and his patients underwent.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Even before moving
to Esalen, Stan

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.440 align:middle line:84%
worked with Abe
Maslow and Tony Sutich

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to develop transpersonal
psychology, which

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
recognized the spiritual
nature of humanity

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and the importance of memories
from our time in the womb

01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:58.270 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We got to the point where
we were very satisfied with

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the kind of new psychology,
but we had no idea how we could

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
possibly link that gap between
this kind of system that we

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:13.660 align:middle line:84%
created and what we knew as
the scientific psychology.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where meeting Fritjof
Capra and reading his book,

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:20.570 align:middle line:84%
"The Tao of Physics," was
extremely important for me.

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Frances Vaughan
invited him to Tiburon

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.530 align:middle line:10%
to meet transpersonal
psychologists,

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:28.370 align:middle line:10%
and we really hit it off.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.980 align:middle line:10%
>> We planned these
seminars together,

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.840 align:middle line:10%
which we called journeys
beyond space and time.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:41.170 align:middle line:10%
And those were an inner journey
of transpersonal experiences

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:44.890 align:middle line:10%
and the outer journey
of physicists delving

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:48.010 align:middle line:10%
into matter at the atomic
and subatomic level.

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Fritjof would take the
morning and tell people how

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
scientists, physicists now
see the world of matter.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I presented perception of
reality where the solid objects

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
of our everyday experience
dissolve into energy patterns

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and where particles can travel
backward and forward in time,

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
where these energy patterns
furthermore are intrinsically

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
dynamic, the whole universe
being some sort of a cosmic

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:24.250 align:middle line:90%
dance of energy.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Stan was describing very
similar experiences.

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, he
was comparing them

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
to the experience of mystics.

01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Now we had three perspectives.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The mystical experience, the
transpersonal experience,

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and the experience of physicists
in those subatomic experiments.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> After lunch when people
came, it was time for me to talk

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.930 align:middle line:90%
about my research.

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:54.165 align:middle line:10%
It was pretty sober as compared
to what Fritjof was describing.

01:07:54.165 --> 01:07:55.540 align:middle line:10%
And I was talking
about something

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:58.060 align:middle line:10%
that happens in some unusual
states of consciousness,

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.820 align:middle line:10%
whereas Fritjof was
redefining the material

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.380 align:middle line:10%
world that we live in.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.260 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the key insights from
the new physics is that reality

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.810 align:middle line:10%
has something of a holographic
structure or a fractal

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:09.610 align:middle line:10%
structure.

01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And the simplest example of
this is a mathematical structure

01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Mandelbrot set.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Now in science, this
is called nested sets

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of self-similar
structures, but I

01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:24.399 align:middle line:84%
like to think that
this is actually

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
a modern scientific discovery
of an ancient hermetic principle

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:29.950 align:middle line:90%
of alchemy.

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:32.229 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:34.569 align:middle line:90%
As within, so without.

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
That basically, the microcosm
replicates the macrocosm.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
If we apply these
ideas to spirituality,

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.479 align:middle line:84%
what I would propose
is that consciousness

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
itself has the same
fractal structure, which

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:52.689 align:middle line:84%
means that there is
a self-similarity

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:55.859 align:middle line:90%
at all levels of existence.

01:08:55.859 --> 01:09:01.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan was one of the
very first to give this new

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
conception of life and this
new perception of reality

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
an emotional content,
an experiential content.

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:14.609 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one of his
many great contributions.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.580 align:middle line:10%
>> So many new perspectives
were introduced during those

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.979 align:middle line:10%
workshops and
month-long intensives.

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:22.680 align:middle line:10%
Michael Harner, who Stan
had met on his first trip

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.990 align:middle line:10%
to the United States,
presented his work

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:27.479 align:middle line:10%
in core shamanic practices.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It was 1965.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.420 align:middle line:90%
We met at the Esalen bathtubs.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this was an
interesting meeting.

01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:38.855 align:middle line:84%
We were both stark
naked when we first met.

01:09:38.855 --> 01:09:39.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:39.655 --> 01:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
A good way to start.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Had nothing to hide.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Tarnas,
together with Stan,

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.609 align:middle line:84%
developed archetypal astrology
as a means for gaining a deeper

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:53.729 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the forces
influencing individual

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:56.080 align:middle line:90%
and collective psyches.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We noticed the phenomenology
of the perinatal matrices could

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
have been passages from
handbooks of astrology.

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was mind
blowing, because I

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
had no understanding of
astrology when I was doing it.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But then we found out
something even more amazing,

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that actually people were
having in their sessions

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
the encounter with elements of
these matrices at the time when

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
they had these planets as
some significant transit.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:25.360 align:middle line:10%
So it became
something that allowed

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.040 align:middle line:10%
prediction, what kind of
experiences people would have.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.910 align:middle line:10%
I had the chance to spend
very informal time with people

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:middle line:10%
who were the pioneers.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, Fritjof Capra,
Rupert Sheldrake, Karl Pribram.

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:40.935 align:middle line:84%
We had Huston Smith,
Joseph Campbell.

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
No university had
that kind of a staff.

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:47.760 align:middle line:10%
So when I started the
International Transpersonal

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.280 align:middle line:10%
Association, I could
pick up the telephone

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.940 align:middle line:10%
and say, I want to do a
conference in Bombay, in India.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I can pay the round-trip
ticket and feed you.

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.440 align:middle line:90%
They put you up.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.050 align:middle line:90%
But I can't give any honorarium.

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to come?

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:04.440 align:middle line:90%
And they all said yes.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan Grof wrote me a long
handwritten letter saying how

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:08.850 align:middle line:90%
much he liked my book.

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:10.320 align:middle line:90%
He'd had a copy shipped.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And he invited me to
speak at a conference

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.080 align:middle line:90%
he was organizing in Bombay.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.455 align:middle line:84%
But I'd never been
to California,

01:11:16.455 --> 01:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never heard of things
like the New Age movement.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of Stan Grof.

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of Esalen.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly in this
hotel it was a kind

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
of astonishing
world of people who

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.980 align:middle line:84%
were into
consciousness research,

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Esalen Institute.

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Stan was talking about his
psychotropic breathing and LSD

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.560 align:middle line:90%
research, and so on.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed to find
myself in an environment

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
where I could talk
about the things

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I was really most
interested in, where

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
people were interested
in finding out

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
more, a kind of fizz of
excitement and discovery

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.050 align:middle line:90%
and new horizons.

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> People were just very hungry
to find an atmosphere where

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
they could connect with
like-minded people.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
They were not
afraid of criticism

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that would have any implications
for their reputation

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
or their position.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.430 align:middle line:10%
So we really got the
truth from people.

01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:12.810 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a domain of
potentiality which is

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:16.470 align:middle line:10%
non-local, and
therefore, it is oneness.

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe
doesn't work on the--

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan represents what
has been sorely lacking,

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
which is the long throughline,
a work over decades.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Because in this wild,
meandering exploration

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
of the further reaches
of human nature,

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the '60s, but
even in the long sobering up

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
of the '70s, he's
been able to provide

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.870 align:middle line:90%
a huge body of empirical lore.

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:50.320 align:middle line:10%
>> It's fair to say, I think,
that I wouldn't be doing

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.310 align:middle line:10%
the research that I'm doing had
it not have been for reading

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:57.550 align:middle line:10%
Stan's "Realms of the
Human Unconscious."

01:12:57.550 --> 01:13:00.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yet despite the tremendous
insights shared during

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.520 align:middle line:10%
Stan's tenure at Esalen and
his continued exploration

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.800 align:middle line:10%
of the healing power
of non-ordinary states

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.320 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, so
little has changed.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The work with holotropic
states also provides very,

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
very interesting insight
into how we should approach

01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the situation that we have
in the world where we are

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
in global crisis, in some
sense on the verge of possible

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%
extinction.

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:30.290 align:middle line:10%
And not just our species, but
taking a few species with us.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Changing the situation
is not simple.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
We cannot just do
kind of transpersonal,

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
spiritual sanitization
of creation,

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
if we simply eliminate
everything that we don't like

01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
that we think is bad or evil.

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It was hard for me to
hear what Stan was saying.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd always hoped that one
could avoid darkness and pain.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to believe
that light and shadow were

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:59.150 align:middle line:90%
equal parts of the whole.

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps ayahuasca could help
me make peace with that.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.250 align:middle line:90%


01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
ayahuasca is that it can

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:09.650 align:middle line:90%
take a long time to come on.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
The mistake that I made was
thinking I hadn't had enough.

01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:18.030 align:middle line:90%


01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I really thought I was dying.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
But in my heart, I knew
that it was too late.

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:29.540 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to be done,
so I purged and surrendered.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:35.650 align:middle line:90%


01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while
to realize that I

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
was in another dimension, and
that as long as I remained

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.940 align:middle line:90%
formless in it, I was fine.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
If I tried to feel my body,
I was instantly nauseous.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.650 align:middle line:84%
For six hours, I stayed
in the quantum field.

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
At times, it seemed I was
watching reincarnation

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
where a soul would merge
with the possibility wave

01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and then tumble down into
increasing density, flipping

01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
like a coin between
victim and perpetrator.

01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much every
deep experience

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I've had since has been
uncomfortable in ways

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:14.280 align:middle line:90%
I never could have imagined.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But most often, I end up in a
place of great beauty and love,

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
as though the ugliness had to be
fully experienced before I had

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.230 align:middle line:90%
access to the underlying joy.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
When I look back at my
archetypal astrology,

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
I see now that I've been through
a series of death and rebirth.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
What died was my
limited sense of self.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Once that illusion
slipped away, I

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
could feel my true
nature as energy

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.440 align:middle line:84%
beyond the creative
and destructive cycles

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
timeless and vast,

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
within a unity that might
be forgotten but never lost.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.510 align:middle line:90%


01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.970 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's healthier
to know that the devil is

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:59.930 align:middle line:10%
something within our psyches
and within our souls as humans

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:06.490 align:middle line:10%
rather than some
object out there.

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people who are
in touch with the state

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
of the world right now recognize
that we're basically all

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
skating on thin ice.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
There is a profound
sense of uncertainty

01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and potentially looming danger
of catastrophic proportions.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot of
courage to face that.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We can't simply be
sure we can be bringing

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
in some technological fix
or a rational solution

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.970 align:middle line:90%
to this situation.

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Uncertainty itself
is a key part of

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.340 align:middle line:90%
any initiatory transformation.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a pretend
near-death experience

01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to have an effective
transfiguration of how

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.560 align:middle line:90%
you live.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
You need to really feel
everything is at stake

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.690 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know the outcome.

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And if we can have the
courage to face that

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and to go through this
dark night of the soul,

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
in some sense, and to bring
all our' wits and heart

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and imagination and
bravery together

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to engage this
great threshold, I

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
think that's the
key to our future.

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> If anybody's
paying attention,

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:16.570 align:middle line:90%
they're traumatized in some way.

01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelics can help
us deal with those fears

01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and still look
positively at what

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
we can do to contribute
to make them better.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
the astronauts who've

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
looked back at the
Earth from space

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and realized that it's a
single organism, that there

01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
are no clear country boundaries,
that we're all in this

01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.890 align:middle line:90%
together.

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of this 14
billion years of evolution

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and have been spiritualized.

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
When people grasp the
sense of the whole,

01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:45.712 align:middle line:84%
that has profound
political implications.

01:17:45.712 --> 01:17:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot cheaper to
give somebody a psychedelic

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.212 align:middle line:90%
than shoot them up to the moon.

01:17:49.212 --> 01:17:52.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of psychedelics
to profoundly change people is

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.640 align:middle line:90%
remarkable.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%


01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The information that was
delivered to me in those

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
experiences has pretty much
formed the rest of my life

01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:09.670 align:middle line:90%
since then.

01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> The depression was gone.

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Never came back.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I became a different
person who was

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
able to enjoy life,
learn how to love,

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
who was nicer to my children
and my grandchildren.

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
The substance, which
was a psychedelic,

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
helped me so much
that I dedicated

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life to make
it available to everyone

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.410 align:middle line:90%
who suffers.

01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I now have
completely, 180 degrees,

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
modified my viewpoint to
understand that we are

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings, performing and
acting and learning in physical

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.160 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is through the power
of some of the psychedelics,

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
it's through some of the
ideas of Stan and the people

01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
that he has brought together
with him that this new opening

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.560 align:middle line:84%
has happened in my life as well
as in the lives of thousands

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.420 align:middle line:90%
and millions of people.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And now ever since that,
any time when things like this

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
happen-- of course, they
happen again and again--

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.350 align:middle line:90%
I remember what Stan told me.

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:24.180 align:middle line:90%
You're ready.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Face it.

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Your psyche will not give
you any task that you cannot

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.420 align:middle line:90%
tackle.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.050 align:middle line:90%


01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:36.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Regardless of the method,
it's the state one finds

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:39.710 align:middle line:10%
themselves in that
matters, awake and joyful

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:42.800 align:middle line:10%
in the heartfelt knowledge
of being part of something

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.510 align:middle line:10%
greater.

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It's only fitting that Stan
experienced his own rebirth

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.280 align:middle line:90%
after Christina's passing.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
For years, he had suffered
from debilitating back

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
pain and nerve
sensitivity in his legs,

01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
but a higher than normal
dose of medical marijuana

01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
launched a process that
freed him from that pain.

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had the feeling
that I was dying.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all the people
who died before me--

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Angie Arrien and
Christina, Sasha Shulgin

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:14.790 align:middle line:90%
and Hans Ruedi Giger.

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So I had the feeling this
is the end of an era,

01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.660 align:middle line:90%
and I was joining.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there was that sense
like, no, you're not ready yet.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And sort of, you
go back, you know?

01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:26.260 align:middle line:90%
You have more work to do.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And I went for about
a month into a lot

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
of non-ordinary states
of consciousness.

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Spontaneous chanting was coming.

01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
A significant part of
it was about whales.

01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> During this period, Brigitte,
one of Stan's first students

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and dearly loved by
him, reached out.

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:48.060 align:middle line:10%
>> During the first phone
call where we reconnected,

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:52.110 align:middle line:10%
she told me that she was about
to go for a trip where it is

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:55.080 align:middle line:10%
possible to actually meet
the whales and swim with

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.130 align:middle line:10%
the dolphins.

01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:59.640 align:middle line:90%
That was an amazing experience.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We first met when Brigitte
came to a lecture of mine

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
in Freiburg after she had had a
very difficult LSD experience.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And very shortly
afterwards, she participated

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
in our first
breathwork and decided

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to come to Esalen where
she stayed for a year,

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and she did several
of the trainings

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of holotropic breathwork.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved her.

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
She's brought incredible
spirits into all the groups

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:32.460 align:middle line:90%
that she participated in.

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And she was always a light
of my life at the time

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
when I was committed
to really not have

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
any way of sort of bringing
the relationship farther.

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:49.020 align:middle line:10%
And then the situation
changed, so we decided

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:53.340 align:middle line:10%
to join our lives together.

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> A toast to it's
never too late.

01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
In everyone's life, it
is just never too late.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:04.440 align:middle line:10%
>> I never expected that late
years in my life would be

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.430 align:middle line:10%
the happiest time of my life.

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I've just always loved him,
and I feel very blessed that we

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:14.440 align:middle line:90%
can be together.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a dream come true.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just this oneness we
share, and the humor and the way

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
we see things, the inner
journeys that we share.

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just wonderful
to be married to Stan.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:31.340 align:middle line:90%


01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And just as Stan and
Brigitte's paths circled back

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to Esalen where they
now teach together,

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
so has my journey returned me
to a familiar sense of peace.

01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:45.380 align:middle line:10%
What began as a quest to
reconnect with my teachers

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.810 align:middle line:10%
has evolved into a
deeper understanding

01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:50.140 align:middle line:10%
of what it is to be human.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I followed the path
that Stan forged

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and explored the
darkness and the light,

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.950 align:middle line:90%
finding beauty in both.

01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:59.700 align:middle line:90%


01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The Tantric imagery
that drew me to Stan

01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
now makes up a daily practice
that not just maintains,

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
but grows the
sense of connection

01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I've found through
my psychedelic work.

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
What I find amazing
is the parallel

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
between what happens to
one's brain on psychedelics

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and what is experienced
in Tantric meditation.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.620 align:middle line:90%


01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I learned so much from Stan.

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
The techniques he developed
and the spiritual grounding he

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
provided for them holds such
promise for these challenging

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
times.

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
May we follow his
example and begin

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.540 align:middle line:90%
our own journeys of discovery.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:55.670 align:middle line:90%


01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:58.790 align:middle line:10%
>> One really fundamental
principle of shamanism is that

01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:middle line:10%
everything is one and
is alive and has spirit.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It was indeed this other
reality that could be accessed

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.620 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:14.732 align:middle line:10%
And like Stan, I've
come to that conclusion

01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:18.120 align:middle line:10%
that it is ontologically real.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The energies that people
liberate in themselves,

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.350 align:middle line:90%
it's just so beautiful to see.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just
live up to, I don't

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.115 align:middle line:84%
know, how little
of our potential

01:24:28.115 --> 01:24:30.690 align:middle line:90%
in normal, everyday life.

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:34.060 align:middle line:10%
And so seeing people
becoming alive,

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:41.190 align:middle line:10%
including myself, and
awakening is just beautiful.

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:46.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Bringing about any change in
a way of being in the world is

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.870 align:middle line:10%
having some access
to these deep layers.

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:54.630 align:middle line:10%
And one of the ways used
by all traditions is sound.

01:24:54.630 --> 01:25:00.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Those moments that may
be so tragic or so joyful,

01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:03.900 align:middle line:10%
so ecstatic that reside
in the collective,

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.540 align:middle line:10%
maybe reside in the
collective unconscious,

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:11.250 align:middle line:10%
they live again through us
in these non-ordinary states.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:14.190 align:middle line:10%
And again, the
practice of working

01:25:14.190 --> 01:25:17.250 align:middle line:10%
with the transits of
understanding them

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:21.420 align:middle line:10%
through an astrological
lens can provide a map

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.020 align:middle line:10%
to see each one of those
experiences through history,

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and then how it comes to bear
on our own personal experience.

01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> A new concept, a new
paradigm from the ground up.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.650 align:middle line:10%
What the universe is, who we
are, and where we are going?

01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:39.600 align:middle line:10%
These are, to me,
the key questions.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.740 align:middle line:10%
And basically, it has to be an
integral, integrated answer.

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.630 align:middle line:10%
Or if you don't
find it, then it's

01:25:45.630 --> 01:25:48.150 align:middle line:10%
our fault, because
the universe doesn't

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.710 align:middle line:10%
work on little bits and pieces.

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:51.510 align:middle line:10%
It works as a whole.

01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:56.382 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like a side
effect of the drugs.

01:25:56.382 --> 01:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Like you could say,
well, they have

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:00.870 align:middle line:90%
these religious experiences.

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the spiritual dimensions
is the core dimension.

It's the core dimension.

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not an add-on that
you can take or leave.

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:17.730 align:middle line:10%
And that changes everything.

01:26:17.730 --> 01:26:20.550 align:middle line:10%
>> People who do some
responsible systematic work

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:24.555 align:middle line:10%
with these powerful
experiential methods,

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:29.010 align:middle line:10%
from some intense spiritual
practice to psychedelics,

01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:32.100 align:middle line:10%
they tend to develop
independently a certain kind

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.860 align:middle line:10%
of worldview that they share.

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.780 align:middle line:10%
It's the Buckminster
Fuller idea, you know?

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.800 align:middle line:10%
We are on a spaceship.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.090 align:middle line:10%
We are all in it together.

01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:42.690 align:middle line:10%
And what some of us do
will influence the others.

01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:44.820 align:middle line:10%
There's no way of
isolating that.

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.010 align:middle line:10%
I have seen that
powerful transformation

01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:49.140 align:middle line:10%
happening in individuals.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether this is
possible on a large scale

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and whether we have enough
time, that's a different story.
