And I also had a very
strong connection with him.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And then he confirmed the
recognition of me as a tulku.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
he wanted me to come

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to Rumtek, where I would be
enthroned and put in robes.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
last you ever hear of me.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:90%
But Trungpa Rinpoche said no.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
He said he was born in
the West for a reason.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And he would undersee
my education.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would not be
taken to Rumtek.

to study and practice.

a lot of the problems

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that I had being a
tulku in the West

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and not having a
form and a structure

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.615 align:middle line:84%
that tulkus maybe
had in the East.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:90%

And often, some
of the charlatans

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
also inspire the students in
the name of being teachers.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:90%
So there's room for that.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:90%

Buddhists who inspired

understanding together.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It can only work with
the Western world

00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:84%
is that it is necessary to
have that kind of situation.

we can live on import.

point that we've

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%

My father was born in a

He would be raised

fled Tibet on the heels

that digs into your head,

all these pads in it.

In Buddhism, there

01:04:48.695 --> 01:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
is concepts such as
reincarnation, concepts

01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:54.390 align:middle line:90%
such as tulku, all of that.

system that we have in Tibetan,

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%

something like this

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.790 align:middle line:90%
exists originally in Buddhism.

But the actual institution or
the culture or the tradition

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
of trying to find a tulku
and then enthroning them

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and all of that is a
bit of a Tibetan thing.

that culture, institutionalized
tulku, that culture is dying.

that's almost for the better

to-- if the Tibetans are
