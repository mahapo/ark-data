00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.510 align:middle line:10%
>>And welcome to Secrets, the
Energy and Harmonics Revolution

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.610 align:middle line:10%
conference.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Chet Snow and I'm
your host this morning.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.630 align:middle line:10%
As you can hear, those
that have the whole set,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.210 align:middle line:10%
I am doing better and I
really appreciate that.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:10%
Actually due to
new energy devices

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.450 align:middle line:10%
and working with the
biomagnetics and electrics

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:10%
of the human body.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I'm a walking guinea
pig for some of the people

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about here,
and I appreciate that.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
This morning, Sunday morning,
we have the great pleasure

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:84%
of having back
with us once again

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
William Henry from
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't recall how long
I've known William,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:90%
but it's been 15 years.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:10%
Something like that
because I remember

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:10%
when William's very first
book had just come out,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:10%
and he came to
Sedona, and my wife

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:10%
and I saw him and helped
him at a lecture at what

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:10%
used to be a real estate
building, if I recall now,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:10%
and there were about 50 seats.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:90%
And now, look.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
William's going,
really, around the world

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
and speaking to literally
hundreds of people at a time

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and has a myriad of
books and tapes based

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
on the incredible
research that he's doing.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:84%
His most recent
project, which he's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
going to talk to you
about this morning,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is "The Secrets of
the US Capitol,"

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and I like to look at it as what
Dan Brown could not or would

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
not reveal.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.004 align:middle line:84%
So without more ado,
I want to welcome

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
William Henry to the podium.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.601 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Good morning, everybody.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Morning, everybody.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.123 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Chet.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
My presentation
today is going to be

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
based on my book,
"Freedom's Gate, The Lost

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Symbols in the US
Capitol," and I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
want to express my thanks
to Chet and Kallista.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It's with their assistance
here, having me here last year,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that really supported
the research.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:10%
We did the tour in the spring,
continued the research,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:10%
and then the book came
out in August of 2009.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is, according to
Dr. Barbara Wolanin, who's

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the curator of the US Capitol,
this is a historical work.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
The guides are working
this material now.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They're incorporating it into
the tours of the Capitol.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And what they've told
me is that they're not

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.176 align:middle line:84%
able to look at the
Capitol the same way

00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:84%
again after looking
at this material.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful to them.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
This is me with my
co-author, Dr. Mark Gray.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:84%
He's a chiropractor
from Philadelphia.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We worked on this
project together,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.134 align:middle line:84%
and we're standing
in one of the--

00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
in a painting of the "Apotheosis
of George Washington," which

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about in detail,
and part of the sacred geometry

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that we discovered in the
painting that just really

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
started raising
eyebrows in the Capitol

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's as if there's
been a metaphysical time

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
lock, if you will,
on this painting.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
It was painted in 1865 by the
Italian painter, Constantino

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi, and its secrets had
remained unknown until Dr. Gray

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and I revealed them for
the first time this year.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.986 align:middle line:84%
And then we had the great
fortunate occurrence

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
of having, what
I think of as one

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest literary
synchronicities of all time.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, Dan Brown
incorporated or tuned

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
into some of these very
same ideas at the same time,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
but Dr. Gray and I had
published our stuff a long time

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
before Dan Brown, so.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But touche to Dan
Brown because he

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
is reaching millions of people
now with this information.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get into it
here by talking about the US

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Capitol as a dome of ascension.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
You tune in to the
news every night,

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
you look at the US
Capitol, most people

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:90%
can recognize the building.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Most don't have any
clue about the artwork

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that is in the dome
of the US Capitol

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and that, in fact,
it was conceived

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
of as a temple, in fact a
Temple of Enlightenment,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and that it is actually
a dome of ascension.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So before we get
into the Capitol,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
let's just take a
brief tour here of some

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
of the domes around the world
that the Capitol is actually

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:90%
a mirror of.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether
we're at the Hagia Sophia,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.435 align:middle line:84%
or if we're at the
Palladium, or we're

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
at the dome of Saint
Peter's at the Vatican,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:84%
if we're in the dome
here in Michigan.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
If we're in any church
dome around the world,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
domes are always places of
connection with the Divine.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.985 align:middle line:84%
Domes are considered
to be wombs.

00:04:01.985 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They're wombs of
transformation, and when

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.742 align:middle line:84%
we enter a dome, no
matter where it is,

00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:90%
it is considered a sacred space.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
A sacred space that connects
us with the higher energies

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
of the heavenly realms.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to look
at the United States Capitol

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
as a sacred space,
we begin to recognize

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that this was the true vision
of the founding fathers,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that they, in fact, viewed
it as a dome of ascension.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.922 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been
looking at is that,

00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
when we take out
the word ascension

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and put in the word stargate,
that the concepts just directly

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
correspond so that,
in fact, when we're

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
looking at some of these domes
and connecting with the Divine

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.142 align:middle line:84%
being, most often--
and of course

00:04:41.142 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
in Christian churches
you're going to see Jesus

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
in the dome-- that
what we are doing

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
is tuning our consciousness
into this higher realm,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and the dome itself is
a model of what we today

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
think of as a
stargate or a portal

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:90%
into the heavenly realms.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the state
Capitol in Maine.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the state Capitol
in Texas, in Austin.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.176 align:middle line:84%
This is the state
Capitol in Michigan.

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
in these places--

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
this is the Temple of
Science in Washington, DC--

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:84%
when we're looking
up into these domes,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
we're recognizing that we are,
essentially, divine beings

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and these domes
encode the secrets

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of how to awaken that
divinity within us.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And especially the dome of the
United States Capitol, I think,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate dome
anywhere on the planet that

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
encodes the secrets
of ascension,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
the dome came to be.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The New High Dome was literally
constructed during the Lincoln

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Administration.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
During the Civil War,
funds had grown short,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Congress
thought that maybe we

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't commit the funds
to constructing the dome.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But Lincoln insisted that this
New High Dome be constructed

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:90%
as a symbol of the Union.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And I love this painting here.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.217 align:middle line:90%
It's by Ellen Cox.

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It's in the house
wing of the Capitol.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It portrays Lincoln almost in
a magician-esque kind of pose,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
literally willing that
New High Dome to rise.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
kind of poignant

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
because it was his
assassinated body that

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.425 align:middle line:84%
was laid in the Rotunda of
the United States Capitol

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that established that
site as hallowed ground,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
even to this day.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We have photographs of the
construction of the New High

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Dome during the early 1860's.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:90%
You see the pillars emerging.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
You see the dome itself
beginning to rise,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and it had been an
incredibly magical time.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're thinking the
backdrop of the Civil War here.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a bread
factory at that time,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and it was an
infirmary at that time,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and it had to have been
just a powerful feeling

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to be there to watch
this dome rise.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, in 1863,
the Dome is completed,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
the statue of freedom,
the goddess of America

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is placed on top of
the Dome, and it's now

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
sitting for all eyes to see
as the great white mountain

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.670 align:middle line:90%
that we see in DC today.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the painting
that was done

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
by Thomas Ustick
Walter, the Philadelphia

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:90%
architect, a watercolor.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.137 align:middle line:84%
When Congress saw this painting,
they were mesmerized by it

00:06:58.137 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and they instantly
committed the funds

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to the construction of the dome.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Ustick Walter, of
course, was intimately

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
familiar with sacred
geometry, knew

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
what he was doing when
he was constructing

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the Dome as a sacred space
using sacred geometry,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and intended,
literally, for this

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to be a rival to Saint Peter's
dome, to Saint Isaac's dome.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
All of these were inspirations
for the creation of the New

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:90%
High Dome on the Capitol.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was Walter's
interior revision

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that introduced this monumental
mythological painting that's

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
suspended over the Oculus,
or the eye, of the dome.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The painting is called
"The Apotheosis of George

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Washington," and what we've
done in "Freedom's Gate"

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is gone into the
Library of Congress

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and collected some
of the earliest

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:90%
photos of "The Apotheosis."

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.160 align:middle line:84%
This happens to be from the
1870s, this is from the 1930s.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And then when Dr. Wolanin
became curator of the Capitol

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in the 1990s, her
first mission was

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to restore "The
Apotheosis," to clean it up.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And so today, we
are privileged to be

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
able to look up into the dome,
from the view of the Rotunda,

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:84%
at this magnificent painting in
all its just incredible glory.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
The word apotheosis is Greek.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It means to deify, to raise
from a man to a god man,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and what we see in this painting
is George Washington surrounded

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
by angelic beings
sitting on a rainbow,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and he's also surrounded by
other mythological figures whom

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
in just a moment.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:84%
This is an amazing painting,
because it literally

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is saying that
Washington is a deity,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
and that is perhaps a strange
thought to us in our time.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But during Washington's
time, as we're going to see,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
it was a common thought that
Washington had actually raised

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
from the dead,
that he was in fact

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
a deified being, a Christ-like
being, if you will.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.085 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
strange thing for us

00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to kind of contemplate today,
that Washington was thought

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
of as a messianic
figure, as the savior

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
of the country, as he was
called by Brumidi, the painter.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But that is, in fact, how
they view of Washington

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:90%
during his life.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to look
into this painting, I mean,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
there have been analyses
done on this painting

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Wolanin and
others and they point out

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.652 align:middle line:84%
that Washington is portrayed
as a deified being.

00:09:10.652 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
They leave kind of
the rainbow out of it,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
they don't talk too much
about the angelic beings

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that around him,
and they certainly

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
don't discuss in detail
the pagan gods that

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
surround Washington, but once
you start to get into this,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:90%
you realize that, wait a minute.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
This painting, "The Apotheosis
of George Washington,"

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
could well be one of the
greatest alchemical icons

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
ever in human history,
and that's my perspective,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
going to discuss later.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is
the goddess freedom.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
She's the freedom fighter.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
She is the defender
of spiritual liberty.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
She's one of my favorite
characters in "The Apotheosis."

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
She wears the get up worn by
all the spiritual warriors,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
as noted in the
"Book of Officiants."

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:84%
She wears her
helmet of salvation,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:90%
indicated by her starry crown.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.447 align:middle line:84%
She holds the sword of
god, the shield of god.

00:09:56.447 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
She wears the breast
plate of righteousness.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we could
see her feet, I bet

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
she's wearing the
sandals of peace.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the garments,
the clothing,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
worn by all the high
spiritual beings,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and tells us the freedom is,
in fact, a defender, not just

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of earthly freedom,
but she's also

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
intended to be
the representative

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual freedom as well.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
This is Poseidon on his
seahorse, holding his trident,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:90%
or his pitchfork.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:90%
This is Aphrodite beside him.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:84%
All figures drawn from Greek
mythology or Roman mythology.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:84%
This is Mercury, who's one of
the primary gods of America,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:84%
holding the Caduceus
wand, a symbol that used

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
is repeated more than a dozen
times inside the United States

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Capitol.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
caduceus from the alchemical

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
perspective, we're
told that that is

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:90%
the symbol for transformation.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have Mercury,
the god of travelers,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.850 align:middle line:84%
the god of spiritual travelers,
the god of transformation

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and alchemy, handing
a bag of gold

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.889 align:middle line:84%
to Robert Morris, the financier
of the American Revolution.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at this
and you put it together

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well,
if Mercury, or Hermes

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.540 align:middle line:84%
as he's called in Greece, is
the god of alchemy, what kind

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of gold exactly is he handing
to Robert Morris, the financier

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.665 align:middle line:90%
of the revolution?

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
You put that together
with the research

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I've done in southern France, in
Rennes-le-Chateau in particular

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
where Benjamin
Franklin was studying,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:84%
where Thomas Jefferson was
studying, where the Knights

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Templar were manufacturing
white powder gold,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and you have to ask
the question, again,

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%
what are we talking about here?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we're
talking about alchemical gold?

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And so here's Mercury's
Caduceus wand,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:84%
again all over the
United States Capitol.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:90%
A very powerful symbol.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
This is Hephaestus here, the
god of smith craft and alchemy.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
He's called Vulcan in Rome, he's
called Enki by the Sumerians.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin, in
his reinterpretation

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Sumerian myth says that
Enki-- Hephaestus-- was the god

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:90%
who crafted the human body.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you wonder, what did
Brumidi know about this figure,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and what message might be
in this painting concerning

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:84%
human origins and the
potentials within us

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
to transform into
deified beings,

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and to achieve true freedom
and true liberty, which

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is equated by Jefferson
with enlightenment.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's Hephaestus once again.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Then we have Persephone
gathering flowers.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
This is America standing beside
Ceres holding her cornucopia.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Another important Roman
goddess, a symbol of fertility.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:10%
And this is Athena,
another goddess of wisdom

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:10%
and a goddess of alchemy,
also a goddess of war,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:10%
who was standing beside
Benjamin Franklin.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:10%
So that's a brief
introduction to the painting.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I've just shown
to you is about as far

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
as most Brumidi scholars
go, about as far

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:90%
as most Capitol scholars go.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a slight
to these scholars.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just that, again, we feel
like there might have been

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
like a metaphysical time lock on
this painting that was awaiting

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
the time-- and the time
is now-- for the secrets

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:90%
of this painting to be revealed.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go into a
little bit of a review here

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
of the presentation I
gave here last year,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're
going to see is

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that all the material
I'm going to present

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
in the next few minutes somehow
found its way into Dan Brown's

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
book, "The Lost Symbol."

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:10%
And after Dan Brown's book,
"The Lost Symbol" came out,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:10%
people started
emailing me asking me,

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.295 align:middle line:10%
was Dan Brown at the
Secrets conference.

00:13:17.295 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:10%
Was his wife in the audience?

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Because your thought
processes and your comments

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:84%
about "The Apotheosis" somehow
made their way into his book.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And so here's "The American
Rite" in a brief fashion.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:10%
My friend and alchemical
researcher, Arion Love,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:10%
points out that the seven
vignettes that we just

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:10%
looked at can be seen as
representing the seven

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:10%
transformations of
alchemy reflected

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:10%
in the emerald
tablets of Hermes.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is very important
because, when Brumidi

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:10%
is studying in Rome, he is a
student of the work of Raphael,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:10%
the great Renaissance painter.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:84%
He was also a student of
the work of Michelangelo.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And both Rafael and
Michelangelo were students

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:90%
of the "Emerald Tablet."

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
They were privy to the new
alchemical secrets that

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
had recently been
decoded, and they

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
were masters of sacred
geometry and knew

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.762 align:middle line:84%
how to encode these
secrets in their paintings.

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look at
Brumidi from this perspective,

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
we see that he has access,
in the Vatican archives,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
to all these astonishing secrets
that Michelangelo had access

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to, that Rafael had access to,
and he utilized that knowledge

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and put it inside the
dome of the US Capitol.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Those seven levels of
transformation in this painting

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
are-- to alchemists-- are
calcination, dissolution,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
separation, conjunction,
fermentation,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:90%
distillation, coagulation.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:10%
And what Brumidi's vision was
all about in "The Apotheosis",

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:10%
which is shared by
the founding fathers,

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:10%
is that the living wisdom
in which everyone exists

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:10%
within the same light of evolved
consciousness and cosmic order

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:10%
is possible in America.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:84%
America as a goddess
is equated with Mott,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.379 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian goddess of Divine
order and cosmic knowledge.

00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And this was part of the
vision of the founding fathers

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
was to create not
just a physical place,

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
but a psychological space where
people were free to evolve.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Where people were
free to transform.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:10%
Where the church, where the King
were completely off our backs,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:10%
and we were in a place where
we could fully transform

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:10%
and awaken ourselves as beings.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:10%
And they knew that if
individuals would follow

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:10%
this path of transformation,
this path of awakening,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:10%
that on the planetary
level, we could create

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:10%
an alchemical awakening
called coagulation,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:10%
which is a return to
the Garden of Eden,

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:10%
this time on a higher level
in tune with the Divine mind.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
inspiration, I believe,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
behind Brumidi's
painting in the Capitol,

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as the original vision
of the founding fathers.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Esoterically, this
alchemical symbolism

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
can be seen as the embodied
liberation of the human soul

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:90%
through the alchemical process.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
painters were all about.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what Brumidi was trying
to create in "The Apotheosis."

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:84%
As we're going to see, he
was very successful in this.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:10%
And so when the alchemists
are talking about these seven

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:10%
steps, they portray
them as seven steps

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:10%
going into the holy temple
with the phoenix rising

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:10%
above the temple.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is the model that
Brumidi is working from.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, what he's seeing is
that this cave that we see here

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:10%
in this alchemical painting
was actually the cave

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:10%
that he was going to paint
his alchemical masterpiece in.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:10%
The US Capitol
Dome is that cave.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:10%
It is that womb of
transformation, symbolically.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi knew that and
incorporated this symbolism

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:10%
in to this remarkable painting.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a photo that
I took in the Rotunda,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of looking up at
"The Apotheosis."

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You see the Apotheosis is
surrounded by 72 stars.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Very important number,
that's a processional number.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk
with Graham Hancock,

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you talk about-- with
any of these researchers

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.129 align:middle line:84%
into the ancient world and
you mention the number 72,

00:16:48.129 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
suddenly their eyes
light up and they

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
recognize that putting
72 star around this

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
was not by coincidence.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I first gave this
presentation in Pennsylvania

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and I put up this painting
and featured these stars,

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember Dr. Gray was in
the audience, and I said,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
we have Washington sitting
on a rainbow here surrounded

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
by stars, which I prefer
to call a stargate.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget he raised
his hand and ask the question,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
are you saying that the Rotunda
of the Dome of the US Capitol,

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:90%
is a stargate?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:90%
It is a temple of ascension.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:84%
It is a portal, that's the
word Dan Brown settled on.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Instead of using stargate,
he used the more--

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the more
comfortable word, portal.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, this
symbolism that we're

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
going to be exploring here
is all about transfiguration

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:90%
and ascension.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:10%
And I decided to call
this "The American Rite"

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:10%
because it is our right,
as Americans, to achieve

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:10%
this ultimate transformation
and to achieve this ascension.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:10%
The unfoldment of the
inner life energy that

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:10%
triggers this ascension is
also known as Kundalini,

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.074 align:middle line:10%
and that's exactly what
Mercury's staff symbolizes.

00:18:00.074 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:10%
When we come over here and we
look at the liberty cap worn

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:10%
by young America here,
that symbolizes the birth

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:10%
of the inner spirit body.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.025 align:middle line:10%
It symbolizes awakened
consciousness.

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:10%
When we come back
over here to Athena,

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:10%
the spear that she shakes
symbolizes the activation

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:10%
of that life energy.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:10%
She was called the spear shaker.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:10%
In fact, many believe that
Sir Francis Bacon, who

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:10%
had the vision of America
as the new Atlantis,

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:10%
took his name from
Athena when he called

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:10%
himself William Shakespeare.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:10%
She was the spear shaker,
and what Bacon knew

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:10%
is that it's all
about activating

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:10%
this dormant energy within us.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:10%
And so when Athena
starts shaking her spear,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:10%
it's time to watch out
because the inner life,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:10%
the inner knowledge, is
beginning to awaken within us.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And so here she is in the
detail sitting-- or standing

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
beside Benjamin Franklin,
who's at the other end

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the Capitol
Dome symbolizes the cranium.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:90%
It symbolizes the human head.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word "dome"
is slang for the head.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what these artists,
and these painters,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and these architects
knew is that when

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:84%
you're inside the
Dome of the Capitol,

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
you're actually inside a
model of the human head.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a photo of me
in the Capitol visitors

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:84%
center showing the
cutaway of the dome

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.552 align:middle line:84%
and pointing to
"The Apotheosis,"

00:19:18.552 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and when they built the
Capitol visitors center

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.051 align:middle line:84%
and put this in
there, I thought this

00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
was one of the greatest mystery
school keys I've ever seen.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Fontana, who is the
communications and marketing

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.874 align:middle line:84%
director at the Capitol,
gave me permission

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
to have my photo taken here.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Normally you can't
do that, so it's

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:90%
kind of special photo to me.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But the main reason I show it
is because, to me, it hopefully

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:84%
hammers home this idea that
when you're in the dome,

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:90%
you're in a model of the dome.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
You're in a model
of the human head.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking up
through "The Apotheosis",

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
through the eye of
the dome, you're

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:84%
looking up into
the heavenly realms

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:84%
as if you're looking
through your own third eye.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the way that
this place is read,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.324 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the artwork
inside actually reflects.

00:20:03.324 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:84%
What we're really
talking about, though,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
about the dome,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe, is the pineal
gland, because that

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is where all the enlightenment
activity takes place.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
The whole shooting match here
is to activate the pineal gland

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:84%
to get to release the
secretions within it that

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
contain the secrets to begin
the process of transmuting

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:90%
and transforming our bodies.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.851 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
in the dome, I'm

00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
thinking we're not
only in the head.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We're specifically
referencing the pineal gland,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to get
that activation to happen.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a photo through
an electron microscope

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.192 align:middle line:90%
of the human pineal gland.

00:20:36.192 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it's covered
with these calcite micro

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:90%
crystals.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The telephone companies, the
wireless phone companies,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are doing this
research because they recognize

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.966 align:middle line:84%
that our pineal
gland is basically

00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:47.524 align:middle line:90%
a wireless transmitter.

00:20:47.524 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is
that they're going

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to take the cell
phone out of our hand,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
put it in our tooth
for a little while,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:84%
but they ultimately
recognize that we already

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
have a cellphone
inside of our brain.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It's the pineal gland.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we could learn to
decalcify the pineal gland

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and let it work as
this radio transmitter,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps it can receive
these transmissions coming

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.437 align:middle line:84%
Or even perhaps
elsewhere in the galaxy.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
Jacob is wrestling

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
with the angel at Peniel,
that's a reference

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.940 align:middle line:90%
to our mystic anatomy.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
awakening our higher selves

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:90%
by activating the pineal gland.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And what we see over and over
again in the Capitol imagery

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:10%
is that we're talking about
this process of transformation.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:10%
And then we're talking about
going to the high mountain

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.104 align:middle line:10%
and receiving the
higher energies,

00:21:34.104 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:10%
we're actually talking about
climbing to the high mountain

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:10%
within us of our pineal gland,
wrestling with our inner angel,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:10%
activating our higher
spiritual potential,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:10%
and then achieving
enlightenment.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And that is true freedom.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is modeled
inside this dome of the United

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:90%
States Capitol.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see the
Dome, we're seeing,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
actually, our human
dome, our cranium.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
freedom up on top,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:90%
she's the spiritualized being.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
She's the freedom fighter who's
in the spiritual realm for us.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
She has put on all the
garments of the angelic realm,

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and she is there beckoning
us to achieve true freedom

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:90%
and true enlightenment.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's shift gears
just for a little bit

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.657 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about the
US Capitol as a temple.

00:22:17.657 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about the
Capitol as a temple,

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
most people have no awareness
that the United States

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.799 align:middle line:84%
Capitol was conceived as a
temple by the founding fathers.

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the inscription
that's in the house

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
wing of the Capitol, it
was put there in the 1830s.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It says, "We have built
no temple but the Capitol.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
We consult no common oracle
but the Constitution."

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Now when they built the
Capitol visitors center

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and opened it in
December of 2008,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:84%
some of the conservative
centers and Congressmen

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.733 align:middle line:84%
got kind of up in
arms were like, what

00:22:46.733 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
do you mean calling
this place a temple.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.076 align:middle line:84%
Well obviously they
hadn't read history books.

00:22:52.076 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they're
members of this temple,

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.231 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know what
they're actually working

00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
in, and that's a big problem
because then they don't behave

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
as if they're in
a temple either.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Then it says, "--we
consult no common oracle

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
but the Constitution."

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:84%
An oracle is a divinely
received revelation.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
An oracle is a sacred
spot of real estate

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
where these divine
messages are received,

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and what they're telling us here
is that the US Capitol is not

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
only a temple, but our
Constitution is an oracle.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I remember Senator DeMint from
South Carolina getting all up

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
in arms when he heard this
because he said, well,

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:90%
what about the Bible.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:90%
What about God?

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
How come there's no reference
to Jesus Christ in this temple?

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was is because
the founding fathers were not

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Christians.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.648 align:middle line:90%
That is a total misconception.

00:23:41.648 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:90%
They were diests.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They worshipped all the
gods and wanted people

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
to be free to worship all the
gods, not one particular god.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
They worshipped
the deity, and they

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
believed that the
Capitol was a temple

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and that our Constitution itself
was a divinely received oracle.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're in
the old Senate room

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and you see the
goddess justice, who's

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
modeled after the
Egyptian goddess, Maat,

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:84%
she holds her scales of justice
her sword is aimed downward,

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.600 align:middle line:90%
indicating peace.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Then we see this angel over here
with the sunburst over its head

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.332 align:middle line:84%
holding the United
States Constitution.

00:24:15.332 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
some-- I don't go

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:84%
so far to say that
the Constitution

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and the Declaration of
Independence were channeled,

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
but the belief is
firmly in place

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that these are divinely
received manuscripts.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
These are divinely
received oracles.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:10%
And so Senator DeMint was
saying, we need to do more.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:10%
We need to know the true history
of the United States Capitol.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:10%
We need to know
what was going on

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:10%
in the minds of the
founding fathers

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:10%
when they were writing
the Declaration

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:10%
and the Constitution,
and certainly signing it.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that became a big driving
force in the presentation

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:84%
"The American
Rite", which became

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the book "Freedom's Gate," was
to answer this question once

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and for all.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:84%
What were the motivations
of the founders as

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
concerned to the
United States Capitol?

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Is this just another building?

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Would it have been OK
on 9/11 if those planes

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
had demolished the Dome of
the United States Capitol?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.237 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, of
course, is no it would not

00:25:09.237 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
have been OK because
this is one of the most

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:90%
sacred spaces on the planet.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, the problem
is that, if you're not

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
treating this as
a sacred space--

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean Dick Durbin came out
just two months ago and said,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:90%
the banks own this place.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
The way I feel about it is I
say, if you don't like that,

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:90%
then you have two choices.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:90%
One, do nothing.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Or do what Jesus did when
he went into the temple

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and found the money
changers running the temple.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:84%
You throw their asses
out on the street.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.685 align:middle line:90%
And that's what has to happen.

00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:42.675 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:43.665 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:43.665 --> 00:25:45.645 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:45.645 --> 00:25:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And we do that by going into
our temple as individuals.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It is not only our right
to go into this temple

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and to worship.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
It is also our responsibility
to go into this temple.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The folks at the
Capitol don't like it

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
when I repeat Senator
Harry Reid's comments

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:84%
when they opened the US
Capitol when he said,

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
we welcome you to
the People's Temple.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:90%
That raised some eyebrows.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But then he went on to say that
he's happy that the new Capitol

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
visitors center is
open, because now we

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
won't have to smell the
tourists on the hot summer days.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.342 align:middle line:90%
That's how they view you.

00:26:23.342 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how they think of you.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You're the cattle coming
back into the barn.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I say is,
let's get more cattle

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:90%
coming into the bar.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
If we make them uncomfortable
with our presence,

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
then we need more of us
going into the Capitol

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.885 align:middle line:84%
and really stinking
up the place.

00:26:38.885 --> 00:26:39.384 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:39.384 --> 00:26:40.288 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:40.288 --> 00:26:41.192 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:41.192 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that
with all due respect

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.407 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
only way I believe

00:26:47.407 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:90%
change is going to happen.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:84%
As long as you are an abstract
concept to these people,

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
to look you in the eye

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
as they're stealing you
blind and enslaving you

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
with a debt that is never
intended to be repaid,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
then they're going
to just continue

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%
doing what they're doing.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you're coming in there
and, to use their terms,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
stinking up the place, then
it's a whole new ball game.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Congressman James
Wilson of Pennsylvania

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
prophesied in 1787
that America's

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
new federal government
would, quote,

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
"lay a foundation for
erecting temples of Liberty

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.094 align:middle line:90%
in every part of the earth."

00:27:22.094 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
That was part of the vision
of the founding fathers,

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
that they would build
the temple in DC,

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would duplicate this
temple throughout the world.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:84%
An 18th century poet,
Benjamin Russell,

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
envisioned the Capitol's
Dome in his tome "The Birth

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:90%
of Columbia."

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Published on
December 3, 1788, it

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:84%
reads "Behold the FEDERAL
DOME majestic rise.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
On lofty pillars reared whose
ample base on firm foundations

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
laid, unmoved shall stand 'til
happy your unnumbered circles

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:90%
run.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The TEMPLE OF CELESTIAL
LIBERTY who designs from heaven

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:90%
to bless our happy plains."

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:90%
There it is right there.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
That is the common
belief in 1788,

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
just before they lay
the cornerstone in 1793,

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that the United States
Capitol temple was

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:84%
a temple of celestial liberty,
and that its designs came

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:84%
from heaven, just like
all the ancient temples.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we learn
this in first grade?

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we learn this
in elementary school?

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.704 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we teach
our kids this?

00:28:19.704 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, one
of the greatest

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
honors that I've had in
writing "Freedom's Gate,"

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I was in Los Angeles, and
a woman came up to me,

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and she told me that she
teaches school in Watts.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me for
complimentary copies

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of the book so she could use
as a textbook in her class.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.442 align:middle line:84%
It's like, that's where
the rubber meets the road.

00:28:37.442 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
So touche to her.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson, who's called
the Capitol's chief visionary,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
called it the first temple
dedicated to the sovereignty

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Sovereignty, in this case,
equals enlightenment.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a temple dedicated to
the enlightenment of the people.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Because Jefferson
equated liberty

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.090 align:middle line:84%
with knowledge and knowledge
with enlightenment.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.790 align:middle line:90%
This was what it was all about.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And an anonymous essay of 1795
described the Capitol building

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.560 align:middle line:90%
as a temple erected to liberty.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, the founders
of the US Capitol temple

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
likened it to Solomon's
Temple in Jerusalem.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's how we get that.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Here's Maryland grandmaster
Joseph Clark on September 18,

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
1793 at the langue
of the cornerstone

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:84%
or the Capitol saying, "I have
every hope that the grand work

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have done was dedicated
to the like work on that ever

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.630 align:middle line:84%
memorable leader of our temple,
the master of our temple,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:90%
the grandmaster Solomon."

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So literally at this
cornerstone ceremony,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
they are dedicating this temple
to their grandmaster Solomon.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:10%
Then we have President
Adams comes along a couple

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:10%
years later saying, "it would be
unbecoming the representatives

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:10%
of this Nation to assemble for
the first time in this solemn

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:10%
Temple without looking up to the
Supreme Ruler of the universe

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:10%
and imploring His blessing."

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.012 align:middle line:10%
The solemn Solomon's Temple?

00:30:03.012 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
You look how their words
just start to flow together,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize or begin
to appreciate their mindset.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Sol Om On.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
ancient names for the sun.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And the United States
Capitol is a re-creation

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon's Temple.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is kind
of controversial

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
because, of course, you've
got the Jews, the Christians,

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Muslims waiting in
Jerusalem for Solomon's temple

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.980 align:middle line:84%
to be rebuilt, and that's
the trigger for Armageddon.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the message here is, you
don't have to worry about it.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.989 align:middle line:84%
It's already been rebuilt. It's
been rebuilt in Washington DC.

00:30:36.989 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States Capitol.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It is Solomon's Temple.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
looking at models

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
of Solomon's
Temple-- for example,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
this model is in the
Philadelphia Masonic Museum--

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.742 align:middle line:84%
we see that Solomon's
Temple, while they really

00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
aren't sure what
it looked like, we

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.283 align:middle line:84%
know that at the time of
Jesus and Mary Magdalene,

00:30:53.283 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
it was thought to have had
a tall tower in front of it.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating
about this is that,

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:84%
when the masons and the
Vatican starts getting involved

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and starts recreating
Solomon's Temple,

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%
they show it clearly
as a domed Temple.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is one of the
key paintings in the Sistine

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Chapel.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
When the cardinals and others
assemble to elect a new Pope,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.240 align:middle line:84%
they go into the Sistine
Chapel, and they stay in there.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.637 align:middle line:84%
It becomes an apartment until
they elect the new Pope.

00:31:22.637 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:84%
The person that gets to sleep
under this painting, which

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is called "Christ Giving
the Keys to Saint Peter,"

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
by Perugino this is considered
to be the fortunate place

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:90%
to sleep.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is Jesus
giving the keys to Saint Peter,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:84%
establishing the authority
of the Catholic Church,

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and behind him is
Solomon's Temple.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's clearly portrayed
as a domed temple

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.750 align:middle line:90%
sitting on an octagon.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would think that
when the Vatican commissioned

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
such a painting, they would
be interested in some accuracy

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
here, especially
since this becomes

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:90%
one of the favored paintings.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems as if
somebody in the Vatican

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.950 align:middle line:84%
agrees with the masons that
Solomon's Temple, as it existed

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.220 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Jesus
and Mary Magdalene,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.860 align:middle line:90%
had a domed roof on it.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was an octagonal
temple with a domed roof.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So here's the United States
Capitol in the 1820s,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and here it is beside Solomon's
Temple in Perugino's "Keys"

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.820 align:middle line:90%
in the Vatican.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:90%
They're identical buildings.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
This is Raphael's painting of
"The Marriage of the Virgin,"

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Joseph and Mary being married.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Raphael is obviously cued
into the same kind of concept

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.150 align:middle line:84%
because he portrays Solomon's
Temple as a domed Temple

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
sitting on a polygonal platform,
once again establishing it

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:90%
as a dome.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
This is Jerusalem's
Dome of the Rock,

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:90%
built between 687 and 691.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:90%
It's considered hallowed ground.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Jews venerate it as the site
where Solomon's Temple stood.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, the site where the
Ark of the Covenant was placed.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:84%
This is looking up into
the Dome of the Rock,

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and this, of course, is the
place where Muhammad ascended

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens atop
his winged horse,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:84%
al-Buraq, again
linking the concept

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.740 align:middle line:90%
of the dome with ascension.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.870 align:middle line:10%
This is a diagram of the Dome
of the Rock with the Shetiya

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:10%
rock in the very center.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:10%
So here you see the
octagonal pattern

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.930 align:middle line:10%
of the Dome of the Rock,
the circular center

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.920 align:middle line:10%
with the sacred rock upon
which the Ark of the Covenant

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.560 align:middle line:10%
was supposed to have sat.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And here's a representation
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.400 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about
this is that Carl Sandburg

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
called the United States
Capitol the Ark of the American

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Covenant.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And so clearly pointing
back to this idea

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that the US Capitol is
connected with Solomon's Temple.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So on the left is the diagram
of the Dome of the Rock,

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and on the right is Thomas
Ustick Walters diagram or plan

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:90%
for the United States Capitol.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:84%
What does Thomas
Ustick Walter envision?

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
An octagonal platform
with a circular dome

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:90%
resting on top of it.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.045 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect match.

00:33:55.045 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:84%
There's no question in my mind
that Thomas Ustick Walter,

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
the great Philadelphia
architect,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
is telling us that the
dome of the US Capitol

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:84%
is modeled after
Solomon's Temple.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is the
third Solomon's Temple.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Here's actually the plan
of the dome, the painting

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:90%
by Thomas Ustick Walter.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Here what I did,
just for fun, is

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:84%
I took the diagram of
the Dome of the Rock

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.489 align:middle line:84%
and superimposed it
over the Apotheosis.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.471 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:24.679 align:middle line:90%
That's coincidence, isn't it?

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, sure.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.632 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
The US Capitol is
Solomon's Temple.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at Washington
now, sitting on the rainbow.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:36.449 align:middle line:90%
We have a temple.

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
We need a deity
in that building,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and that deity is
George Washington.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Another hint of
the sacred geometry

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
here, this is Solomon's
seal, perfectly superimposed

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.050 align:middle line:90%
over the Apotheosis.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Each of the six figures that
surround George Washington

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
become the points
of Solomon's seal.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence?

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Another reiteration
of this same message.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:90%
This is Solomon's Temple.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:90%
This building is a temple.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a temple of ascension,
and it is the place

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.290 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately we will learn
the secrets of ascension.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Calling the Capitol a
temple is more than poetic.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:84%
US Capitol has numerous
architectural and other

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.030 align:middle line:84%
features that
unquestionably identify it

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.970 align:middle line:84%
with ancient temples,
including stone construction,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
an underground
entrance, chapels,

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:84%
an image of a deified
being, George Washington,

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
numerous images of
heavenly beings,

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:84%
religious imagery,
symbols and inscriptions,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.280 align:middle line:84%
divine proportions, sacred
geometry, massive columns,

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
palpable spiritual
energy, acoustic trickery,

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
terrifying guardians
that today carry

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:84%
automatic weapons,
mystic visitors,

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:84%
closed doors, private
members, secret chambers,

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and an orientation to the sun.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a temple-- it's a Solar
Temple, to be specific--

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and it is a private
temple, and you

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.730 align:middle line:84%
are reminded of that every
time you're in the Capitol

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:84%
because you'll see
doors constantly

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:90%
that say members only.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as my friend
Jordan Maxwell has said,

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:84%
well, people ask me, well,
why is this a private temple?

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.020 align:middle line:84%
How come people don't know
that this place is a temple,

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and it has all this sacred
geometry and this imagery?

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And Jordan's answer is the
best I've ever come up with.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:84%
His answer is, it's
none of your business.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:90%
This does not concern you.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:90%
You're not a member.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And I think he's right.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And that attitude
is prevalent here.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we have the opportunity

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:84%
to shift that attitude,
and the only way we shift

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.370 align:middle line:84%
it is by going into this
temple and utilizing it

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose that
it was created for,

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:90%
which is a temple of ascension.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the Dome itself.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:10%
When we cross
cultures, we recognize

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:10%
the dome as a cosmic symbol.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:41.210 align:middle line:10%
It is akin to or equivalent
to the stupa of India.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.880 align:middle line:10%
So here's a stupa in India.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:10%
Here's the dome of the
United States Capitol.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:49.770 align:middle line:10%
The stupa is a place of rebirth,
according to the Buddhists.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.370 align:middle line:84%
A stupa also creates a
spiral or a vortex of energy

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that spins around
a central axis,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly what we find
in the Dome of the US Capitol.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:84%
The palpable spiritual
energy that you

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.340 align:middle line:84%
feel when you're in
the Rotunda is there

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:84%
because that was what that
place was designed to do.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And there is that vertical
axis, beginning with Washington,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
up on the ceiling in
front of this open sun

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.350 align:middle line:84%
gate on a direct
vertical line down

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.516 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
Rotunda is a gold dot.

00:37:17.516 --> 00:37:20.720 align:middle line:84%
One story beneath
that is the crypt.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.527 align:middle line:84%
That's what they call
it, the crypt, which

00:37:22.527 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:84%
is very fascinating, because
civic buildings don't

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:90%
have crypts.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Temples have crypts.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Churches have crypts.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:90%
The US Capitol has a crypt.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a temple.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:84%
One story beneath the
crypt is Washington's tomb,

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:90%
all on this vertical line.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Who's buried in
Washington's tomb?

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:90%
It's empty.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Why is Washington's tomb empty?

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, because he's
on the ceiling,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.400 align:middle line:90%
because he resurrected.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
He's just like Jesus,
whose tomb was also empty.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the message.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a temple of
ascension, and all

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.200 align:middle line:84%
of the artwork, all of the
imagery you see within it

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
reflects this idea
that we're talking

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:90%
about a temple of ascension.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The same concept-- just to
kind of get a visual on this--

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.030 align:middle line:84%
is modeled in the
Reichstag Dome in Berlin.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.129 align:middle line:90%
The new Reichstag Dome.

00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go into
the Reichstag Dome,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
you see this vortex
of energy, and that

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what you feel
when you're in the Rotunda.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I was there just
recently with the BBC,

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and the guards got all
nervous when I laid on my back

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.160 align:middle line:90%
and I looked up.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking up
into the Apotheosis,

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.985 align:middle line:84%
and I almost
couldn't get back up.

00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm on my back thinking,
oh, this is just great.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.987 align:middle line:84%
I've got a BBC camera
right in my face,

00:38:41.987 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and I've got the guards
starting to move in on me,

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and I can't get up because it's
just got this energy pouring

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.090 align:middle line:90%
right through me.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely a
remarkable experience,

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and it reminds me
of what you feel.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:84%
What I felt is what you see
here in the Reichstag Dome.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:84%
This incredible vortex that
is created in this place.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure and convinced that the
people that go to Washington

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:84%
are probably
essentially good people.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.544 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that they're
not spiritually developed.

00:39:08.544 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:84%
They're not
emotionally developed.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.950 align:middle line:84%
They'll take an intern into the
back room of the White House

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:90%
at the drop of a hat.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They're not mature people by
any stretch of the imagination.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And they live in
the lower chakras.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:84%
They're focused on
pure materialism.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.600 align:middle line:90%
They're focused on power.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they come
into a place like this,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:84%
they're no match for what
they experience in this place.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's no wonder that
many of these politicians

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:84%
get just intoxicated by
the power of this place.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.120 align:middle line:90%
They think it's about them.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not about them.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It's about what this
place represents,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and what America
represents, and they

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.100 align:middle line:84%
have forgotten what
America represents

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
as a place of awakening,
enlightenment,

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.320 align:middle line:90%
and higher consciousness.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, they'll
start getting the message.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking up
into the Dome here.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We're looking up
into the vortex.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Today is November 22, 2009.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It's 46 years after President
Kennedy was assassinated,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and this is President Kennedy
laying in state in this vortex.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Now let's just think about this.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
We're in a vortex.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:90%
We're in a dome of ascension.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You have a quarter
million people

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that have lined up on
Constitution Avenue,

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and come in, and they
circumnavigate this body,

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're all putting
spiritual energy

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:90%
into that being.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you suppose
the effect of that is?

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
That is what I believe this
building was designed for.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:90%
It is a temple of ascension.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:10%
This is President
Ford laying in state.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:10%
And you can just
imagine the spirit

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:10%
of this being recognizing that,
OK, this is like a code book.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:10%
In Egypt, they did this
in the temples too,

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.700 align:middle line:10%
so that when the Divine
spirit of the pharaoh

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:10%
came out of his body at death,
he would look around the walls

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.790 align:middle line:10%
and go, oh yeah, that's
what I'm supposed to do.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to go
through that gateway

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:90%
and into the heavenly realms.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And this is exactly what you
see modeled in the ascension

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:10%
dome of the US Capitol.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So you've got the
president laying in state,

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.610 align:middle line:10%
and you've got this whole idea
of the stargate or the portal

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:10%
modeled right up above us.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So the United States
Capitol, according

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to my research and the research
I've done with Dr. Gray,

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.480 align:middle line:84%
says that this is an
alchemical temple.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a temple of ascension.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.090 align:middle line:84%
When the alchemists do
a diagram such as this,

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
they're telling us that
we follow the steps.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:90%
We climb the seven steps.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.940 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.550 align:middle line:90%
All good children go to heaven.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.600 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that if
we can learn to decode

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.810 align:middle line:84%
the book, the ascension manual,
the code in the dome of the US

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Capitol, we, too, can ascend
into the heavenly realms

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:90%
and achieve true freedom.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, Dan Brown
comes along and presents

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.770 align:middle line:90%
his book, "The Lost Symbol."

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
What I had said in
"The American Rite"

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.130 align:middle line:84%
is that US Capitol is a
portal-- it's a stargate.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.010 align:middle line:84%
That "The Apotheosis
of George Washington"

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:84%
contains the key
to enlightenment.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And what it points to
is the pineal gland--

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that we need to learn to
awaken the pineal gland.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And I invited people,
in that presentation,

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.130 align:middle line:84%
as I'm doing today, to come
to the Capitol with me.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Lay on your back and absorb
the energy of this place

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.881 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that when we're
looking up at that painting,

00:42:12.881 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
we're looking up at one of the
greatest alchemical paintings

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a code book, it's
a manual, telling us

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.480 align:middle line:84%
how we ascend and achieve
true freedom and true liberty.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm surprised when "The
Lost Symbol" comes out

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and Dan Brown has his
character, Robert Langdon,

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.490 align:middle line:84%
go into the Capitol in
search of a secret portal.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:35.280 align:middle line:84%
He goes into the Rotunda and
looks up at "The Apotheosis"

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and says, that's the key
to higher consciousness.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And then he has Robert
Langdon lay on his back

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and look up into "The
Apotheosis" and say,

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.850 align:middle line:84%
this painting contains the
key to higher consciousness,

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's all about
the pineal gland.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, boy this is
really sounding familiar.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.775 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:42:51.775 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Because this has
never been revealed

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.480 align:middle line:84%
before except in my work and
that work I did with Dr. Gray.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that Dan Brown

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.860 align:middle line:84%
put in this book
that is very key

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.120 align:middle line:84%
says that there's
a consciousness,

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:84%
he calls it noetics,
that we can all tap into.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.910 align:middle line:84%
That we can access this
higher consciousness,

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.315 align:middle line:84%
and we can unify our minds and
bring about positive change.

00:43:13.315 --> 00:43:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Well what I'm here
to tell you is

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that I think that's absolutely
true, and that Dr. Gray

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and I are living embodiments
of what Dan Brown says

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is going on in the
United States Capitol.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We have that proof because
we published this work

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
long before Dan Brown's
book was published.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take this
one step forward.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Five times a day, Muslims turn
towards Mecca and pray together

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.367 align:middle line:84%
and it unifies the
Muslim consciousness.

00:43:41.367 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:84%
What I'm suggesting
is that what would

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:84%
happen if three times a day,
Americans turned to the east

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and directed positive intentions
towards this Liberty Bell

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that we call the Dome
of the US Capitol

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and get this thing
ringing and vibrating

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:90%
at a higher spiritual level.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:01.589 align:middle line:84%
I think that would drive the
rats right out of that ship.

00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.125 align:middle line:90%
That's the plan.

00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:07.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the plan.

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:84%
My intention is to work with
Dr. Dean Radin and others

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:84%
who know about this
consciousness and how it works

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and develop meditations that
will get this bell ringing

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.210 align:middle line:90%
at that higher vibration.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:90%
That's our only hope, I think.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.926 align:middle line:84%
That's how we're going to
run the money changers out

00:44:21.926 --> 00:44:22.930 align:middle line:90%
of this temple.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.790 align:middle line:10%
So let's dive into
"Freedom's Gate"

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:10%
and look at what Dan Brown
didn't get because he

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.540 align:middle line:10%
didn't read this book.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHING]

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.010 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on here?

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is George Washington
on the rainbow surrounded

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:90%
by the angelic beings.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:90%
He's portrayed as a deity.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Specifically,
Washington is sitting

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.264 align:middle line:90%
in front of an open sun gate.

00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
Egyptian tradition,

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.670 align:middle line:90%
the sun was considered a tunnel.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.770 align:middle line:84%
A star tunnel, a sun
tunnel, or a stargate.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The way to get to heaven
was through the sun.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The sun was the way, the
truth, and the light.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And then Christianity came along
and inserts Jesus in the sun

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.880 align:middle line:84%
gate and says that Jesus
is the way, and the truth,

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and the light.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Well when Brumidi's
coming from the Vatican,

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
he decides that he's going
to put Washington on there

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.209 align:middle line:90%
as the American Christ.

00:45:10.209 --> 00:45:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Now a little bit of back story.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Constintino Brumidi was a
Vatican painter, very, very

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:90%
popular painter at the time.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:84%
He was refurbishing some
of the works of Rafael,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:84%
doing repair work
in the Vatican.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1848, there's
a revolution in Rome.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.030 align:middle line:84%
The Roman people
decide, wait a minute.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.936 align:middle line:90%
We want more choices.

00:45:27.936 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't just want to
be Jews and Christians,

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.660 align:middle line:84%
we want to be free to
worship any god that we like.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Vatican
was opposed to that.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is there's
a revolution, Brumidi

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.440 align:middle line:84%
sides against the Vatican, and
when the Pope regains power

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.950 align:middle line:84%
in 1848 Brumidi is
imprisoned and sentenced

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to 18 years in prison.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.580 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that
the Jesuits come over

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.850 align:middle line:84%
from New York, the Black Pope as
this is person's called, comes

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to the Vatican and makes a
deal with the Pope saying,

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:84%
if you'll let us take
Brumidi back to America,

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.980 align:middle line:84%
we'll utilize him
painting churches

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and other religious buildings.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the Pope
says, fine but he

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:84%
says that Brumidi is free to go
but his wife and children are

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.590 align:middle line:90%
going to stay here with us.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.220 align:middle line:90%
So Brumidi has a choice.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Rot in prison, or go to
America, the land of the free,

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.310 align:middle line:84%
the only land he said where
true liberty is experienced

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:23.230 align:middle line:84%
on the planet or
lose his children.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And so he makes the decision
to come to the United States,

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and his wife and
children stay behind.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can start to see
Brumidi's mindset when

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.970 align:middle line:90%
he comes to the United States.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:84%
He's wanting true freedom
and true liberty, which

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't experience
in Rome, but he's

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.818 align:middle line:84%
also got a little bit of
a chip on the shoulder

00:46:38.818 --> 00:46:41.460 align:middle line:84%
because essentially his wife
and kids are being held hostage

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.890 align:middle line:90%
by the Vatican.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.460 align:middle line:84%
The reason I believe that
this is because Brumidi

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.270 align:middle line:90%
knows something.

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi knows something
extremely important,

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Pope just
doesn't want to kill him.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.490 align:middle line:84%
He wants to keep him alive
and try to use him as best as

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:84%
possible, but also recognize
that if his wife and children

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:84%
are being essentially
held hostage

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that Brumidi might possibly kind
of keep tight lipped about what

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.044 align:middle line:90%
he really knows.

00:47:05.044 --> 00:47:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So he comes to the United
States and gets this opportunity

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to paint the Capitol, and we'll
look at some of his other work

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.330 align:middle line:84%
here in a moment,
but I just wanted

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.080 align:middle line:84%
you to have that kind
of mindset as you're

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:84%
looking at the strange
picture of Washington

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.030 align:middle line:84%
sitting on a rainbow
with his purple robe on.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.920 align:middle line:84%
This is Raphael's "La
Disputa" in the Vatican,

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.220 align:middle line:84%
which shows the
resurrection of Jesus.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It shows Jesus enthroned
in his heavenly realms.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And Rafael, rather, has Jesus
right in front of the sun gate.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Then Brumidi gets this chance to
paint Washington, lo and behold

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:40.040 align:middle line:84%
he's got him also in front of
the same open sun gate, also

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:84%
on the rainbow now,
wearing this purple robe.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Well when you look at Christian
images of the resurrected

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, we learned that he,
too, wears the purple robe.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The purple robe is
considered to be--

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.410 align:middle line:84%
or the purple toga is considered
to be the Divine garment.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you see Jesus
wearing that purple garment,

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:02.260 align:middle line:84%
it's a symbol of his divinity,
a symbol of his ascension.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jesus delivering
the Beatitudes.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the siren
and the fishermen.

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:08.750 align:middle line:90%
We've got the purple robe here.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We've got Jesus in his
transfiguration wearing

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.660 align:middle line:90%
the purple robe.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.180 align:middle line:10%
Jesus walking on water
wearing the purple robe.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Washington with the purple robe.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
what Brumidi's going to do

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.940 align:middle line:84%
is essentially tell us
that George Washington

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.230 align:middle line:90%
is the American Christ.

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.960 align:middle line:84%
We not only have Brumidi
with the purple robe,

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:84%
but he's also got
him on the rainbow

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.150 align:middle line:90%
just like the resurrected Jesus.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.690 align:middle line:10%
When you see Jesus in
throne in Christian art,

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.890 align:middle line:10%
he is sitting on
his rainbow throne.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.570 align:middle line:10%
When we come back to
George Washington, not only

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:10%
does he have the purple robe,
but he's on the rainbow.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:90%
He is the American Christ.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:90%
He is a deity.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Washington has resurrected.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.060 align:middle line:90%
He is now a deity.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi's not
saying worship him,

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.820 align:middle line:84%
but he is saying that
George Washington has

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:57.210 align:middle line:84%
achieved true enlightenment
and true liberty.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.410 align:middle line:90%
He has resurrected.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Now those images
that I just showed

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:04.270 align:middle line:84%
you, that was all brand
new news to the Capitol.

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.030 align:middle line:84%
They had never made
that connection before

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.960 align:middle line:84%
in the Capitol
Historical Society

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.110 align:middle line:84%
or in the architect of
the Capitol's office.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.300 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't in their mindset.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of shocking for
them to see that and undeniable

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.172 align:middle line:90%
that that's what's going on.

00:49:17.172 --> 00:49:18.630 align:middle line:84%
But then I took it
one step further

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and said, well when we look at
the Tibetan images of what's

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
called "The Great Perfection"
or "Mystic Rapture,"

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.380 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans will portray
their enlightened ones,

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or their awakened ones, in a
spiral, or vortex, of rainbow

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:84%
energy because the
Tibetans believe that when

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.525 align:middle line:84%
we achieve ultimate
enlightenment

00:49:35.525 --> 00:49:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that we spin ourselves
into a vortex of higher

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:42.670 align:middle line:84%
vibrational energy and
disappear into another realm.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to travel
and toggle back and forth

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:84%
between the material
and immaterial realms,

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and we live our lives
as these rainbow beings,

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:54.800 align:middle line:84%
or portrayed as these
rainbow body beings.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they call
it, the rainbow body.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that when we
see Jesus on the rainbow,

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and the Tibetans in the rainbow
vortex, it's the same concept.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.890 align:middle line:84%
The way that we
resurrect ourselves

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.390 align:middle line:84%
is by achieving
this rainbow body,

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.710 align:middle line:84%
by spinning ourselves into this
higher dimensional or higher

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.606 align:middle line:90%
vibrational being.

00:50:13.606 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the Gospel of Philip,
one of the Gnostic gospels

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.780 align:middle line:10%
says, "The lord
rose from the dead.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.490 align:middle line:10%
He became as he was, but
now his body was perfect."

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:26.340 align:middle line:10%
This is the Gnostic concept of
salvation, we become perfect.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And that-- perfect
isn't something

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.110 align:middle line:84%
we can get from a
Phoenix plastic surgeon.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't pluck down 25
grand and become perfect.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Although, people try to sell
us that that's possible.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Perfection, in the
mystic tradition,

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.400 align:middle line:90%
is achieving the rainbow body.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.675 align:middle line:84%
Becoming another
dimensional being.

00:50:42.675 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Then the Gospel Philip goes
on to say that Jesus possessed

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.400 align:middle line:10%
flesh, but this was true fesh.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.560 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh isn't true.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.560 align:middle line:10%
Ours is only an
image of the true.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.900 align:middle line:84%
When we have true
flesh, we have achieved

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.240 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow body, which is
why the resurrected Jesus is

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.290 align:middle line:84%
portrayed with the
rainbow body around him,

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.120 align:middle line:90%
or the rainbow rings.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's all about this
Tibetan rainbow body

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.900 align:middle line:84%
tradition, which
the Tibetans tell

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:90%
us doesn't come from Earth.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:14.240 align:middle line:84%
It's taught in 13 star systems
in addition to our own.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Very important point we'll
come back to in a moment.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.350 align:middle line:10%
So here's the resurrected
Jesus in the rainbow body.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:10%
There are numerous names
for the rainbow body.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Every sacred tradition around
the planet has a term for it.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.570 align:middle line:10%
The Divine body, the rainbow
body, the diamond body,

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:31.410 align:middle line:10%
the immortal body, the
perfect body, the ultra human.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:34.010 align:middle line:10%
There are name, after
name, after name,

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.289 align:middle line:10%
and one of the big key ways that
we identify this-- or beings

00:51:37.289 --> 00:51:38.830 align:middle line:10%
that have achieved
the rainbow body--

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.860 align:middle line:10%
is that they wear
a cloak of light.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Either a bright white garment
or a garment composed of stars.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This goddess right
here is America.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.600 align:middle line:84%
She's on the east
pediment of the Capitol.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Her garment is completely
covered in stars,

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and she also wears a star
crown with the freedom cap on.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.940 align:middle line:84%
She has achieved
ultimate liberty

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.059 align:middle line:90%
and ultimate enlightenment.

00:52:02.059 --> 00:52:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why I
believe the founding fathers

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.530 align:middle line:10%
chose this image is
because they knew

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.970 align:middle line:10%
that true freedom
and true liberty

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.950 align:middle line:10%
has to do with awakening this
higher consciousness within us.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they wanted
the dome of the US Capitol

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.930 align:middle line:90%
to be a Dome of ascension.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.700 align:middle line:10%
I was in the-- with
Chet and Kallista

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.780 align:middle line:10%
in a group back in the spring.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:10%
We went to the George
Washington Masonic memorial

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.230 align:middle line:10%
in Alexandria, Virginia, we
went into the Knights Templar

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:31.510 align:middle line:10%
chapel, and here we see this
powerful resurrection image.

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:10%
We see Jesus emerging
from the crucifixion

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.290 align:middle line:10%
as if he's blasting
through a stargate.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:middle line:10%
We see the rainbow
color all around him,

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.590 align:middle line:10%
and we see this white light.

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.850 align:middle line:10%
A thin veil of white light
surrounding his body.

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:46.650 align:middle line:10%
That indicates that
he has achieved

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:50.380 align:middle line:10%
this ultimate enlightenment, the
light body, the rainbow body,

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.520 align:middle line:10%
and goes to this idea
that I've been working on

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:10%
for a dozen years or so that
the crucifixion was actually

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:59.170 align:middle line:10%
a stargate event in which Jesus
transforms or transfigures

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:02.276 align:middle line:10%
himself into a being of
light and then shoots himself

00:53:02.276 --> 00:53:03.900 align:middle line:10%
through that linen
shroud that we today

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.200 align:middle line:10%
call the Shroud of Turin.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's an after
effect, or a relic,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of his transformation,
or transmutation,

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:84%
into a beam of light
showing that he

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.990 align:middle line:90%
has achieved the rainbow body.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.035 align:middle line:90%
So I equate these images.

00:53:16.035 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You can take the Tibetan
image and the image

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Knights Templar chapel
at the Washington Memorial.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.720 align:middle line:84%
It tells me they're all
on the same page here.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They recognize
the same concepts.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Tibetans tell us
that we've achieved the rainbow

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:30.520 align:middle line:84%
body, they will
portray their Lamas

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.180 align:middle line:84%
in a ring, a vortex, or
a vibration of rainbow

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.720 align:middle line:84%
colored imagery
and show them then

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.640 align:middle line:84%
having the ability to
literally travel to stars.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.220 align:middle line:84%
They are biological
beings now that

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.850 align:middle line:84%
may well be these biological
craft that some people

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:47.654 align:middle line:90%
experience at certain sites.

00:53:47.654 --> 00:53:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you go
to Christian churches,

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:52.190 align:middle line:84%
again, you'll see Jesus
in his resurrected form,

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:54.870 align:middle line:84%
just like the Tibetans,
in the rainbow ring.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That's because he's
achieved the rainbow body.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.985 align:middle line:84%
And you and I, that's what
we're supposed to be doing.

00:53:59.985 --> 00:54:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
be learning how

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.592 align:middle line:90%
to achieve the rainbow body.

00:54:03.592 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
there's a little group

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.910 align:middle line:84%
called the Catholic Church
that came in and destroyed

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.680 align:middle line:84%
all of these teachings
and instead implemented

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.060 align:middle line:90%
another teaching.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are those that know
that this is what is within us.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:84%
That we are in a
pupil phase here,

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.830 align:middle line:84%
we're in a cocoon type phase,
we're in an intermediate phase,

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and this is where we're going.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.210 align:middle line:90%
The rainbow body.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when we come back,
and we see Washington

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.140 align:middle line:84%
on the rainbow in
this ring of stars,

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.370 align:middle line:90%
I equate all these images.

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It says that Washington is a
model for the rainbow body.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Tibetans,
just like Jesus,

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.610 align:middle line:84%
they have all achieved this
level of enlightenment.

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:44.300 align:middle line:10%
And Brumidi is
telling us that if we

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.040 align:middle line:10%
want to achieve true
liberty and true freedom,

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.700 align:middle line:10%
we've got to do
what Jesus has done.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.990 align:middle line:10%
We've got to do what
the Tibetans have done.

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, America is
a psychological space

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and a physical space where
we are able to do this.

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we see this William
Holman Hunt painting here

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus in his rainbow body,
then we come back over here

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and we take a look at this
famous painting of George

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Washington by Gilbert Stuart.

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:10.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the one
that Dolley Madison

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.900 align:middle line:84%
rescued from the British
in the White House.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We see Washington standing
in this long coat,

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:20.080 align:middle line:84%
we have a Caduceus leg on the
table here but behind him,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.400 align:middle line:90%
we see this rainbow.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.080 align:middle line:90%
What's that doing there?

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.460 align:middle line:84%
To me, there's only
one explanation.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It's this mindset again
that Washington is

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:32.920 align:middle line:90%
revered as a Christ-like being.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And just like
William Holman Hunt

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.370 align:middle line:84%
shows Jesus with the rainbow
ring outside his body,

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Gilbert Stewart is
also showing Washington

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:47.980 align:middle line:84%
with the rainbow
extending around his body.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.725 align:middle line:84%
Again, Jesus on
his rainbow throne.

00:55:49.725 --> 00:55:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.302 align:middle line:84%
This idea of Washington
as an ascended being,

00:55:56.302 --> 00:55:58.010 align:middle line:84%
or having the ability
to ascend-- I mean,

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.580 align:middle line:84%
people email me
saying, that's insane.

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.960 align:middle line:90%
How can you say that?

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And my response is,
I'm not saying that.

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:09.910 align:middle line:90%
These artists are saying that.

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:14.490 align:middle line:84%
From Washington's own era,
this is what they thought.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You happened to have gone to an
elementary school in America,

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.480 align:middle line:84%
probably in the
1960s or 1970s, when

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.370 align:middle line:90%
all this has been sanitized.

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:24.620 align:middle line:84%
You never learned any of
this because somebody fed you

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:30.040 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of bulls--- about, you
know, apple pie, and baseball,

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and the American way,
and all this garbage.

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
America was set up for,

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:41.820 align:middle line:84%
was as a place of ascension
and enlightenment.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And so look at this image.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.280 align:middle line:84%
This is Washington
rising from his grave

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.540 align:middle line:84%
just like Jesus being
lifted into the heavens

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.100 align:middle line:90%
by angels on a beam of light.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:54.100 align:middle line:90%
This is from 1794.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Then we come over
to this image here.

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I guess George has a message.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.620 align:middle line:84%
He just wants to
talk a little bit.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.880 align:middle line:84%
This is in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York City.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Another painting
called "The Apotheosis

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:11.160 align:middle line:84%
of George Washington," the
deification of Washington.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.750 align:middle line:84%
What we see is
Washington, again,

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:15.017 align:middle line:84%
being lifted into the
heavens through the sun

00:57:15.017 --> 00:57:17.840 align:middle line:90%
gate or the stargate.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Another powerful
ascension image.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.144 align:middle line:90%


00:57:22.144 --> 00:57:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we have
this other image.

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.940 align:middle line:84%
This one is in
the Newark museum.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:31.390 align:middle line:84%
We see Jesus on
his throne up here.

00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And then down below on
a direct vertical axis

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is George Washington
being prepared

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:37.170 align:middle line:90%
to be lifted into the heavens.

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.240 align:middle line:84%
This is how people viewed
Washington in his time.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And so when Brumidi comes
along 50 years later,

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.720 align:middle line:90%
he's still in this mindset.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
ascension and Washington

00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:50.550 align:middle line:84%
as an apotheosized or
deified being, once again,

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.920 align:middle line:84%
being lifted by angels
through this portal

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.630 align:middle line:84%
here, in rays of light,
with Mount Vernon being

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.180 align:middle line:90%
left in the distance back here.

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.970 align:middle line:84%
When Lincoln dies, who's
waiting for Lincoln?

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln's body is laid
in state in the Rotunda.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.340 align:middle line:84%
He resurrects into
the heavenly realms.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Who's there waiting for him?

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Jesus?

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a postcard that
was printed and handed out

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.390 align:middle line:90%
at Lincoln's funeral.

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:22.570 align:middle line:84%
George Washington is there
to meet Abraham Lincoln.

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they believed
Washington had become a deity.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.650 align:middle line:84%
They believed Washington
embodied all of these ideas

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.459 align:middle line:84%
about ascension
and resurrection.

00:58:33.459 --> 00:58:35.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're talking
about when we come back

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.270 align:middle line:84%
here and start to look
at "The Apotheosis"

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:40.390 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective that we're
supposed to look at it from.

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I go to the Capitol frequently,
and I watch the tours.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And here's the typical tour
when you walk into the Rotunda.

00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's "The Apotheosis
of George Washington."

00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's as much
as you get when

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.660 align:middle line:90%
you're doing that whole tour.

00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But now, hopefully,
they're starting

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to stop and talk about what's
actually going on here thanks

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to Dan Brown, and hopefully
thanks to some of the work

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.220 align:middle line:90%
that we've been doing.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when I go in
there, and I'm looking up

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:12.690 align:middle line:84%
into the Rotunda, I
recognize that we are truly

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:84%
in one of the most sacred
spaces on the planet,

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and we owe it to this
man, Constantino Brumidi,

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:22.080 align:middle line:84%
for presenting to us an
astonishing representation

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of all the ancient
mystery school teachings.

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:28.470 align:middle line:84%
This is Raphael's
"Loggia" in the Vatican.

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:32.010 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, Brumidi
studied Rafael in the Vatican,

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:35.100 align:middle line:84%
did repair work
on Raphael's work,

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and then came to the
United States Capitol.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.480 align:middle line:84%
This is Raphael's
painting of Plato.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.387 align:middle line:84%
This is Raphael's
"Transfiguration."

00:59:43.387 --> 00:59:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of giving you a flavor
of what Raphael's work looked

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:46.590 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So that when Brumidi comes
to the United States Capitol

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:55.890 align:middle line:84%
from the Vatican in 1852, and
he looks up and he sees this,

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:57.830 align:middle line:84%
he must recognize,
wait a minute,

00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this building before.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.799 align:middle line:84%
This dome looks
just like this dome.

01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:06.090 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is the Dome
of Saint Peter's, and this

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:08.220 align:middle line:84%
is the Dome of the
United States Capitol.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the dome is newly
completed, and-- excuse me,

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.320 align:middle line:84%
the other Capitol extensions
are newly completed.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And Captain Montgomery Meigs
is looking for a painter

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.530 align:middle line:90%
to come into the Capitol.

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.530 align:middle line:90%
There's the the Vatican.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There's United States
Capitol, and it's obelisk.

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking for painter
to come into the Capitol

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and paint the newly
created corridors.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So here's the Raphael rooms
in the Vatican corridors,

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and here's the Brumidi rooms
in the United States Capitol.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Barbara Wolanin, in
her book about Brumidi,

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
acknowledges that
they're virtual carbon

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.340 align:middle line:90%
copies of one another.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So not only is the exterior
of the United States Capitol

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:48.240 align:middle line:84%
a mirror image of the
Vatican, but the interior

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
Capitol is also

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:53.340 align:middle line:90%
a mirror image of the Vatican.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.850 align:middle line:10%
What we believe
is happening here

01:00:54.850 --> 01:01:01.500 align:middle line:10%
is that both the Vatican and the
US Capitol are solar temples.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And both of those
temples triangulate

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
with Solomon's Temple.

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
mirror one another.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.360 align:middle line:10%
They're all reflective of this
original concept of creating

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.220 align:middle line:10%
this temple of ascension.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So here, again, here's Brumidi
in the Senate corridors,

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.735 align:middle line:84%
and here's Raphael
in the Vatican.

01:01:19.735 --> 01:01:21.890 align:middle line:90%
They're virtually identical.

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
More Brumidi in the
Senate corridors.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.530 align:middle line:90%
They're stunningly beautiful.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.400 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi also painted the
frieze in the Rotunda,

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.450 align:middle line:10%
various images of
American history.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.390 align:middle line:10%
He had a technique,
through painting,

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.530 align:middle line:10%
make it look like they
were 3D sculptures.

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.490 align:middle line:10%
Really interesting.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:41.270 align:middle line:10%
Very powerful cartoons,
including this Aztec Sun Stone

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.640 align:middle line:10%
that's in the frieze
of the capital.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.270 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi had gone to
Mexico City and seen

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.390 align:middle line:10%
the Sun Stone attached
to the cathedral wall,

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.265 align:middle line:10%
made a diagram of it.

01:01:52.265 --> 01:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back
and had the opportunity

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to paint in the
capital, he wanted

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to portray true American,
ancient American, history.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And Meigs would only
let him go this far.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi wanted to go far, far
deeper into American history

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and present images.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But he started here with
the Aztec Sun Stone,

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, is the
very basis for the whole 2012

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%
prophecy.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Back, looking up.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go
into this painting

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and see what we actually
see here with Washington,

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
again, on the rainbow,
surrounded by these dancing

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
women with Fame and Liberty
on either side of him,

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:32.240 align:middle line:90%
in front of the open Sun Gate.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.770 align:middle line:90%


01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And here, these
dancing figures, they

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
have stars on their heads,
which is kind of interesting.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to that in a
moment, about the importance

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.867 align:middle line:90%
of those stars.

01:02:42.867 --> 01:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So once again, let's look at
a few of these figures that

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.740 align:middle line:90%
surround George Washington.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We have Poseidon
on his seahorse.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.502 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we have Freedom
in her spiritual garments.

01:02:53.502 --> 01:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Then we have Mercury-- God
of Transformation, Hermes

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and Greece, both in ancient
Egypt, Poseidon, once again,

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:12.410 align:middle line:90%
on a seahorse.

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Just love that seahorse.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Hephaestus, God of
Smithcraft and Alchemy.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.320 align:middle line:90%


01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
We have young
America beside Sirius

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
holding the cornucopia,
young America

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
wearing the liberty cap, the
cap of higher consciousness.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We have Athena,
the spear shaker,

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.211 align:middle line:84%
standing talking to Benjamin
Franklin at the other end

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:35.836 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow.

01:03:35.836 --> 01:03:42.160 align:middle line:90%


01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And what Dr. Gray
and I discovered

01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
was that, first of
all, those five gods

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
are the five pagan gods
the Vatican had spent 1,600

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.680 align:middle line:90%
years trying to get rid of.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what's Brumidi doing?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Not only has he portrayed George
Washington as a deified being,

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
specifically as a
Christ-like being,

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
but Brumidi has also resurrected
those five pagan gods

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.234 align:middle line:84%
that the Vatican's been
trying to get rid of.

01:04:09.234 --> 01:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I told you he had a
chip on his shoulder

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
when he came over
here, you know-- hold

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.180 align:middle line:90%
my wife and children hostage?

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.677 align:middle line:84%
You know, prevent me
from living my life

01:04:18.677 --> 01:04:19.760 align:middle line:90%
the way I want to live it?

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.176 align:middle line:84%
What's the matter
with you people?

01:04:21.176 --> 01:04:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll get revenge.

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying he
had revenge on his mind,

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
but you can clearly see that
that's a good possibility.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we also discovered
is that not only are

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
those the five pagan gods the
Vatican's trying to get rid of,

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
but specifically, they're the
five pagan gods of alchemy.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
Brumidi has arranged them

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
in the pattern of a pentacle,
the ultimate alchemical symbol

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of transmutation
and transformation.

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I told you, this is the
ultimate alchemical icon,

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
or alchemical painting,
perhaps of all time.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what Brumidi
discovered in the Vatican

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
as he's studying Raphael
and Michelangelo who

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
were privy to the alchemical
secrets that were first being

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:06.460 align:middle line:90%
decoded during the Renaissance.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Brumidi knew all this.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And he got the
opportunity, finally,

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
to paint it in the dome
of ascension, the dome

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.440 align:middle line:90%
of the United States Capitol.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's even more than that
encoded within this painting.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Before we explore
that, let's acknowledge

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans teach that the
rainbow body is constituted

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.604 align:middle line:90%
by the five pure lights.

01:05:26.604 --> 01:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
They're often associated
with the five colored

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Himalayan rainbow-- white,
yellow, red, green, and blue.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The five pure lights are
understood as pure light energy

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and are considered the
most sublime essence

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
quality of the
classical elements--

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
namely space, air,
water, fire, and earth.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So when the Tibetans
portray their Lamas

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
in the rainbow body,
what they're saying

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
is that they have mixed all the
alchemical elements of the body

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and achieved ultimate
enlightenment.

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:57.420 align:middle line:10%
And that is exactly what Brumidi
has done in the dome of the US

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.270 align:middle line:10%
Capitol, is he has
clearly shown us

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:02.920 align:middle line:10%
that the way that we achieve
true liberty and true freedom

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.250 align:middle line:10%
and enlightenment is to
follow that Tibetan path

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.350 align:middle line:10%
of the rainbow body, which
is also the path many

01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:12.360 align:middle line:10%
believe that Jesus followed
in his own Resurrection

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:12.945 align:middle line:10%
and awakening.

01:06:12.945 --> 01:06:16.360 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Going forward, we find other
geometry inside this painting,

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.020 align:middle line:90%
encoded within this painting.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The five points of the
pentacle open into 13.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
There are those 13
star maidens that

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
surround George Washington--
the dancing girls

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
with the stars on their heads.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Think Brumidi is starting
to tell us something now.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
He's wanting us to go forward,
go deeper into this painting

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to open up the pentacle and
to see what's really there.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Keying on these
dancing girls really

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:49.946 align:middle line:84%
created a mind expanding, or
mind blowing, revelation to me.

01:06:49.946 --> 01:06:51.945 align:middle line:84%
I wondered, you know,
when you're in the Capitol

01:06:51.945 --> 01:06:53.653 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking the
tour, they tell you

01:06:53.653 --> 01:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that these 13 star
maidens represent the 13

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
original colonies.

01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But I had a beef with the guide
the first time I went in there.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:03.051 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how can that
be, because that's not

01:07:03.051 --> 01:07:05.280 align:middle line:90%
an earthly scene.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Washington's portrayed
as a resurrected being.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:08.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a heavenly scene.

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Freedom is not an earthly being.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
She's a heavenly
freedom fighter.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
This is all of a heavenly
scene we're looking at,

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
so what could those 13 dancing
girls with stars on their heads

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.330 align:middle line:90%
actually represent?

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I gave you
the clue earlier.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Remember what the Tibetans
said about the rainbow body?

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.440 align:middle line:90%
It didn't come from this planet.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body
teaching, they tell us,

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:35.776 align:middle line:84%
is taught in 13 star systems
in addition to our own.

01:07:35.776 --> 01:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think these
13 star maidens represent,

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
are the 13 other star systems
where this rainbow body

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:43.660 align:middle line:90%
teaching is taught.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.910 align:middle line:90%
And we are the 14th.

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Now what that means
to me is that Earth

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is a colony in a
federation of star systems

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.080 align:middle line:84%
where this awakening,
resurrection, or ascension

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.010 align:middle line:90%
teaching is taught.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Dome of the
United States Capitol

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:04.124 align:middle line:90%
encodes that secret.

01:08:04.124 --> 01:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go into
your ancient text,

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.706 align:middle line:84%
you go into the Bible,
other sacred scripture,

01:08:07.706 --> 01:08:09.720 align:middle line:90%
you can start to create a list.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:16.939 align:middle line:84%
You can come up with Orion,
Ursa Major, Sirius, Cygnus.

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:18.170 align:middle line:90%
That's four.

01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:20.300 align:middle line:90%
The Pleiades, five.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
What they're telling
us here is that there

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:27.779 align:middle line:84%
are eight other star systems
that know this teaching.

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And we're all connected to that.

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:31.846 align:middle line:90%
How's that make you feel?

01:08:31.846 --> 01:08:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Great.

01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:37.229 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking a
whole other level here.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.187 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about beings
that are potentially

01:08:39.187 --> 01:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
coming and going from these
star systems that are here

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
to awaken us and to bring about
this enlightenment teaching

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
to earth.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And the United States Capitol is
ground zero for that teaching.

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
research reveals.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So what is the name,
then, of that star

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
system, or that federation
of star systems?

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:03.220 align:middle line:90%
I think Brumidi is telling us.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.090 align:middle line:90%
E pluribus unum.

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Out of many, one.

01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:08.399 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:11.109 align:middle line:84%
And the message here is that
these other star systems,

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
if we're all connected,
then we're all one.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the message of
stargate metaphysics,

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:16.510 align:middle line:90%
that we're all connected.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
All these star
systems are connected.

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:20.149 align:middle line:90%
All these people are connected.

01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we're the weak
link, potentially,

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.150 align:middle line:84%
in this chain or this
federation of star systems,

01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:27.399 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be sending
people here to bring us up

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
because you're only as
strong as your weakest link.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And that may explain why some
of these other civilizations

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
have such an interest in
what's going on, on Earth,

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.350 align:middle line:90%
especially at this time.

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, that is
the message that Brumidi

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.850 align:middle line:90%
wants us to take here.

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
message here from Brumidi.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
When we go one
step forward and we

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
start to look at this pentacle
and look at the geometry,

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
we're led to an Italian
mathematician who Brumidi also

01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:55.960 align:middle line:84%
studied whose name
was Fibonacci.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
We know him best for the
Fibonacci spiral, the Fibonacci

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.240 align:middle line:90%
sequence of numbers.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.180 align:middle line:10%
But Fibonacci, through his
study of the five elements

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.420 align:middle line:10%
and the sacred geometry
of those five elements,

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.710 align:middle line:10%
also discovered
another profound piece

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:14.150 align:middle line:10%
of sacred geometry, another
symbol of sacred geometry

01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:17.140 align:middle line:10%
called Metatron's Cube.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.520 align:middle line:10%
Metatron's Cube.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.770 align:middle line:10%
And when I superimposed
Metatron's Cube

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:24.520 align:middle line:10%
over the Apotheosis,
what do you know?

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.475 align:middle line:10%
It's a perfect match.

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>>Synchronicity.

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:28.390 align:middle line:10%
>>Synchronicity.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.915 align:middle line:10%
The six circles--
actually, Metatron's Cube

01:10:30.915 --> 01:10:33.620 align:middle line:10%
is composed of 13 circles.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.000 align:middle line:10%
The outer six circles
perfectly correspond

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.500 align:middle line:10%
with the six figures, the
five pagan gods plus Freedom.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.340 align:middle line:10%
And then the interior
circles, of course,

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:45.430 align:middle line:10%
correspond with the
dancing star maidens

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:48.220 align:middle line:10%
and the interior aspect of it.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.120 align:middle line:10%
Then the ultimate
interior circle

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.550 align:middle line:10%
corresponds with the Sun Gate.

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:55.380 align:middle line:10%
What Fibonacci had said
about Metatron's Cube

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.240 align:middle line:10%
and what sacred geometry
said about Metatron's Cube

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.350 align:middle line:10%
is that it literally is
a gateway to ascension.

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It literally is a gateway
to higher consciousness.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe
is that Brumidi

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
knew about the sacred
geometry of Metatron's Cube.

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably
the ruling geometry

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
in the creation
of this painting.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.690 align:middle line:10%
He intended, through is
alchemical knowledge--

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:21.450 align:middle line:10%
most of it derived
from the Vatican

01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:23.210 align:middle line:10%
and from Michelangelo
and Raphael

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and certainly
Fibonacci-- he intended

01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:29.530 align:middle line:10%
to create this icon
of transformation,

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:33.070 align:middle line:10%
knowing that if you could
connect with this painting

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.900 align:middle line:10%
mentally, physically,
spiritually, and emotionally,

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:39.380 align:middle line:10%
that it would begin to tune you
into this higher consciousness

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:42.540 align:middle line:10%
and open up pathways within
your own consciousness.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
The way these paintings work,
the way these icons work,

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
is that they literally activate
latent knowledge within us.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
All of this is encoded
within our DNA.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when the icon makers
would create images of, say,

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the transfigured
Jesus, what they knew

01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is that if we could
drop ourselves

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
into a state of deep
meditation, that such geometry

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and such paintings would just
literally activate this higher

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:07.710 align:middle line:90%
consciousness within us.

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They viewed them literally
as a living gospel.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.240 align:middle line:90%
You didn't need words.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
All you needed was the imagery
and the underlying geometry

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
would start to do the work
on you because basically,

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.650 align:middle line:90%
all we are is walking geometry.

01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like
the software that

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
begins to transform the
hardware of our body.

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Who is Metatron?

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.532 align:middle line:90%
Metatron's an archangel.

01:12:28.532 --> 01:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
According to one
school of thought,

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
he's Enoch, the
ancient wise man,

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.450 align:middle line:84%
the ancient seer, who lived
before the Great Flood--

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
possibly in Atlantis-- and
who was taken to heaven by God

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.920 align:middle line:84%
as a sole pure example of
the pre-flood civilization

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and transformed into Metatron.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, Metatron is very
important in my work

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
because, as a
mythologist, I tell people

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that the reason you want
to spend a lot of time

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
learning this lore,
learning this lingo,

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and putting yourself
into this mind state

01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
is because, as in the
example of Enoch and Elijah

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene
and others, it's

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
hoped that one day you'll get a
visit from one of these higher

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.730 align:middle line:90%
beings.

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And they will interview you.

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They'll take a look
inside and say, hey.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.470 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.350 align:middle line:90%
You done with your Earth work?

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Is your job done here?

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
If so, do you want a new job
at the next higher level?

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And in Enoch's story, that's
exactly what happened.

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
He was taken to the
next higher level

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and he was given a new job.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.450 align:middle line:90%
He became a janitor.

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:33.150 align:middle line:84%
He literally sweeped up
around the throne of God,

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.434 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow throne of God.

01:13:35.434 --> 01:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
sent back to Earth

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
for a time, delivered sacred
knowledge to his family,

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and then returned to
the heavenly realms,

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
continued his janitor
work for a while,

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and then he got a promotion.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
He was given a
new job, guide, so

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that any of the humans-- such as
us-- that got up to this level

01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
meet Metatron, and he

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.180 align:middle line:90%
would be there as our guide.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is why Fibonacci
called his cube Metatron's Cube

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
because he literally believed
that Metatron's Cube itself

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
was the guide for
our consciousness

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that would take us
into this higher realm.

01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:15.460 align:middle line:84%
In 3 Enoch, Metatron, or Enoch,
describes to Rabbi Ishmael

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
how he lived before
the Great Flood

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and was transubstantiated
from mortal to angelic form.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Ishmael tells us
how "he had ascended

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
on high though seven
halls, or heavens, one

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.067 align:middle line:84%
within the other"-- he's talking
about the chakras now, right?

01:14:28.067 --> 01:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
we count the chakras

01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
just like the steps
to the Capitol.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all
good children go to heaven.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So we awaken these seven halls
or holes within us, or heavens.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We begin to see the vision
of the Merkabah-- the Divine

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Chariot or the Throne of
Glory, which is often portrayed

01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:49.777 align:middle line:90%
as that rainbow throne.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
Brumidi is telling us,

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is we've got Metatron's
Cube in here as our guide

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:55.440 align:middle line:90%
to our consciousness.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And what he's ultimately
awakening within us

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is this potential
that we all have

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to transform ourselves
through the rainbow body

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
into these ascended beings.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
"Then Enoch is
lifted into heaven

01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
on one of these fiery horses, or
fiery chariots, in his Merkabah

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and now can toggle back and
forth between the worlds.

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Under the direction of the
archangel Michael and Gabriel,

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Enoch grew in size until his
body filled the whole universe,

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
signaling a reversal
of the fall of Adam",

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.160 align:middle line:90%
according to esotericists.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.570 align:middle line:84%
"He sprouted 72 wings"-- how
about 72 stars, one for each

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.880 align:middle line:90%
of the 72 names of God?

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.170 align:middle line:90%
How about 72 stars?

01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And how about 72 virgins,
exactly-- "36 on each side and

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
grew 365,000 luminous
eyes, indicating he

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.120 align:middle line:90%
had become omniscient.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
God made for him a garment
of glory, a light body,

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.170 align:middle line:90%
and clad him in it.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
In early traditions,
this garment

01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:55.700 align:middle line:84%
was considered a
light substance,

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
in which the inhabitants of
the high heavens appear."

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And so again, this
is what Brumidi

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:04.020 align:middle line:84%
has encoded in the dome of
the United States Capitol,

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
is that this is the
model we want to follow.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We all want to achieve this
state of enlightenment,

01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:10.240 align:middle line:90%
this state of ascension.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
We want to achieve
the rainbow body.

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are beings that
are there to help us.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.587 align:middle line:84%
And if we can meditate on the
geometry of Metatron's Cube,

01:16:17.587 --> 01:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be sort
of like making a phone

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.890 align:middle line:90%
call to these beings.

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Because it begins to tune us.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It puts us on their frequency.

01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we start to
get the help because we're not

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:30.780 align:middle line:90%
going to do this ourselves.

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael, when
Enoch got up there,

01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:34.700 align:middle line:90%
he poured oil on him.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when Enoch has
this oil all over his body,

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
suddenly he shines
like the angels.

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So the message here is
while this sounds daunting,

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
spinning ourselves into a
vortex of rainbow body, rainbow

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
energy, we don't have
to do it all ourselves.

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
We just have to put
ourselves in a place,

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in a position, where those
that are there to help us

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
will do that.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying
is that there

01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
are beings from 13 star
systems that are here

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.450 align:middle line:90%
to assist us in our ascension.

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Dome of the US
Capitol is ground zero

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.420 align:middle line:90%
for this process of ascension.

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So one final remark about
Constantino Brumidi, the story

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
does have a Disney ending.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1870, the Pope
lost control of Rome.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.610 align:middle line:84%
One of Brumidi's
daughters is still living.

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And she came to Washington DC.

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to see her
father, and his masterpiece,

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in the United States Capitol.

01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And he died shortly after that.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So here's a man I believe
that knew the ultimate secrets

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:36.120 align:middle line:90%
of the Vatican.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
You wonder what's in the
vaults of the Vatican,

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
what's buried in the secret
library of the Vatican?

01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is go to
the United States Capitol

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and see what that
ultimate secret is.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that Doctor Gray
and I, and now Dan Brown, we've

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
just begun to scratch the
surface on what is actually

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.460 align:middle line:90%
in that Dome.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just
beginning to see that.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And what it's going to
take is for us to go there

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:02.850 align:middle line:90%
and to claim that Dome.

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:middle line:90%
We have got to own it.

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is not only going
to create a process of change

01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:10.045 align:middle line:84%
in America, to get
these slave masters out

01:18:10.045 --> 01:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
of here that want to put
trillions of dollars of debt

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
on top of us and
forever enslave America,

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:20.440 align:middle line:84%
but it will ultimately lead
to the ascension of not just

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.140 align:middle line:84%
our individual selves but
perhaps millions of people.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's the work that
we're all doing together.

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:26.560 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I've enjoyed talking
with you guys.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Hope you have, too.

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.490 align:middle line:90%
