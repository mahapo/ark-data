If this was a marijuana plant,
it would be mostly or 90% THC,

within the brain acts as a
regulator of excitability.

00:08:02.605 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So if the brain's too excited,
endocannabinoids are released

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and through a negative
feedback mechanism

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
appear to dampen
down excitability.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It can also do the
opposite, though, as well.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
If the brain is
too inhibited they

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
can be released and actually
up regulate excitability.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're like a
buffering system.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:10%
>> For many years, people smoked
cannabis for its psychoactive

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:10%
effects, and no one imagined
that those effects were brought

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:10%
about through interaction with
the endocannabinoid system.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
But it's not surprising,
because for the drugs to work,

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
they have to be modulating
something in the brain,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out to be a
natural cannabis system.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> While we've learned quite
a lot about the body's natural

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
cannabis system, we still
don't know the specifics of how

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
the various molecules in
cannabis interact with

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:90%
their bodies.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%

medicinal cannabis products,

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:10%
medicinal cannabis, but simply
want to talk a bit more about

it.

Hello.

>> One of the participating
families is LJ Elwood and her

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
12-year-old son, Hunter.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Hunter, has Dravet syndrome,
a rare neurodevelopmental

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
disorder where the child
suffers intractable seizures.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Hence, it's a form of epilepsy.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So this one here
was when he was two.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just before he
deteriorated quite a lot.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
He had a massive
seizure not long

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
after this that required
him to go into ICU

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and be induced into a coma.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:18.595 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that started out sort
of downhill time with him.

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
control his seizures.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:10%
So that the children
don't get brain damage

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:10%
or don't receive any damage to
the brain, which, of course,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:10%
with Hunter resulted in
the loss of lot of skills.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Standing, talking, sitting,
holding his head up,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:84%
feeding himself, all these
things that the children

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:90%
lose through repeated seizures.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite trying every
available epilepsy medication,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
nothing successfully
controlled Hunter's seizures.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> This here is
his fifth birthday.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
He was so bombed from
seizures and medications

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that we had to wake
him for these photos.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And so he sat through
every one of his birthdays

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.643 align:middle line:84%
until he was eight, and he
didn't participate in any.

00:10:57.643 --> 00:10:59.435 align:middle line:84%
The only recollection
he has is the photos.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
For six years, he
was in the hospital.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
We spent more days and nights
in hospital than we did at home.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when he was seven
and a half, going on to eight,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:84%
we started looking at
medicinal cannabis,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and sort of getting away
from the pharmaceutical meds

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.997 align:middle line:90%
as much as we could.

>> Hunter's seizures, they
decreased within 24 hours.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
We saw half of them drop off.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was a 50%
drop straightaway.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.062 align:middle line:90%

a gastro feeding tube.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> He became more aware of his
surroundings, more responsive.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:90%
He started recognizing people.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.161 align:middle line:84%

more cognitive ability.

at like trying to gain back

some of his skills.

00:12:05.898 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So he's learned to
say mom again, which

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:90%
he hadn't said in a long time.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So that was really nice,
so he says mom most days.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%

he's sad, upset, or happy.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Gee, it's quite yellow.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%

it's actually very yellow.

>> It's the cannabis compound
CBD that's thought to have

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
the positive effect in epilepsy,
but there are many other so far

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
unexplored cannabinoids
that may also play a role.

Sorry, it's CVA.

>> We have some samples from
the actual PELICAN study.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
It shows predominantly
two cannabinoids,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
as you can tell by the
height of the peaks.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, these
are cannabinoids.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you know, when we
looked at a broad scale,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:90%
you can only see two.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.117 align:middle line:84%
But when you
highlight them, there

00:14:16.117 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
are actually significant
amounts of other cannabinoids.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
They're just kind of
drowned out by how

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:90%
concentrated the other two are.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So the ones that
have the biggest,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
broadest peaks aren't
necessarily the ones with

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:90%
the medical value.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
trying to figure out.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to see even
if some of the ones that

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
are low concentration
might be working

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:90%
at that low concentration.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We've noticed that the
amounts of THC in it is

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
actually quite low.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It's early days yet
with the PELICAN study,

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
but we're not seeing a lot of
THC, which is a good thing,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.110 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want these
children to be intoxicated.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> This means it would have a
negligible psychoactive effect

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
on hunter.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The surprising thing so far
is that we're not seeing a lot

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
of CBD, and we've kind of
assumed the CBD would be very

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
prominent, because there already
is a fair literature on CBD

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So that throws a
spotlight on a whole bunch

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:90%
of more obscure cannabinoids.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to do work
with cells and with mice

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to try and link some of
these more novel cannabinoids

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.045 align:middle line:90%
to anti-convulsive effects.

00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The researchers are using
mice that have been genetically

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:84%
engineered to have a condition
similar to Dravet syndrome,

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:90%
the form of epilepsy Hunter has.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually quite a good
model for the human condition.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.745 align:middle line:90%
They're an excellent model.

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
They exhibit seizures
in association

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
with fever,
spontaneous seizures,

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:90%
and a reduced lifespan.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So we will treat the mice
with the cannabinoids,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:90%
and then we will induce a fever.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:10%
We'll raise the mouse's
body temperature.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.248 align:middle line:84%

different kinds of cannabinoids

00:16:01.248 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
to see what effect
they have on that.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We're looking for the
cannabinoid that is most

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
effective at preventing the
thermally induced seizures,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately, eventually
the spontaneous seizures.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it the case that
some could work together?

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's
definitely the case,

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.713 align:middle line:84%

them in combination.

With no available data yet, but
along with reducing seizures,

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
they're hoping to also
have an effect on lifespan.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what's seen in
Dravet children as well.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:10%
There's sudden death
that can occur.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:10%
It affects about
16% of the children.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So if we can reduce
that mortality rate,

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that would be a
major achievement.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're really hoping will
come out of that is some novel

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
anti-convulsant that there is
a cannabinoid that is yet to be

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
characterized, yet to be
identified there is an even

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
better anti-convulsant
than CBD is.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're working furiously
on that at the moment.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the hope
for the future.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:10%
But right now, in
the clinical world,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:10%
the focus is still on CBD.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Childhood epilepsy is a

anti-epileptic drugs.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:10%
None of them have worked.

They still have

And we're all very
desperate to try and find

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:84%
a drug that can
control their seizures.

now, there's not
much good evidence.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%

And once we have
those answers, they

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
will tell us if medicinal
cannabis is effective,

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.213 align:middle line:84%

>> It comes as a gel rubbed
into the skin twice a day,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.665 align:middle line:84%

sort of doses people will get.

was eight.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%

unusual brain tumor,

very rare one called a
hypothalamic hematoma.

You just feel like you
missed something, do you--

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Which is a benign type
of more, but it's also

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
right deep in the clockwork in
the hypothalamus of the brain.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's classically associated
with this very rare form

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:84%
of seizures called
laughing seizures.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the person has
this merciless laughter

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:90%
several times a day for Lachie.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, he
has more severe seizures,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
where he loses awareness,
and he's not with it.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:90%
So you're in the trial now.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Tell us how it's going.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be
going OK, I think.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What I did notice is that
the seizures are lasting four

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
to five minutes, which is
less than they were before.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But this time, he's
going sound asleep.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Over most of my life, I've
been having seizures at least

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%
once every two, three days.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Glad I can teach you.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not able to travel far
without requiring somebody

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
to aid me.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the meds I
have taken for a long time

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
give me a problem with
my grasp on words.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't help, because I used
to be a pretty good debater,

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and so when I started taking
a larger dose of medication,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.482 align:middle line:84%
it has made me struggle
with some words.

00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You must find that very
frustrating, I'm guessing.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Very.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:90%
See that's cheating.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:90%
You looked.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:84%
This will be my eighth attempt
at finding a medication

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.762 align:middle line:90%
to control my epilepsy.

00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's better
at the end of it.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of it, he
was completely alert.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.535 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's really important
that we acknowledge that

00:20:49.535 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
you've only been on the
trial for two weeks.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:90%
And so two weeks is nothing yet.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
We really can't
make any judgment.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And this could just be
your natural history.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's always hard to
tell if a new drug makes

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.557 align:middle line:84%
a difference until you have
a longer time to play out.

00:21:03.557 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
We also don't know if
you're on placebo or on drug

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:90%
at this stage.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This trial still
has some months to go,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
but a similar one overseas,
using the same compound, CBD,

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:84%
is showing great promise for
children with Dravet syndrome.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And they showed a median
reduction of seizures of 40%,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:84%
convulsive seizures, in the
children compared with 9%

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:90%
in placebo, of placebo cases.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So that is the first real
evidence we have that it works,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and that's fantastic.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
It is important to note that
40% is about the same as some

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
of our anti-epileptic
therapies as well.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.773 align:middle line:84%
So it's not better,
but it's not worse,

00:21:42.773 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be great to have

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
it to add to the range of
drugs we can give our patients.

them with pain reduction
