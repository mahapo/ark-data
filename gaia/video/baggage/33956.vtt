00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:07.844
(woman crying)

2
00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:20.200
(light-hearted music)

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.936
(woman crying)

4
00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:50.352
<v ->Ma'am.</v>

5
00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:51.994
People are waiting.

6
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:55.023
(woman crying)

7
00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:58.372
<v ->He told me he loved me.</v>

8
00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:00.591
<v ->Classic six month cheater.</v>

9
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:04.031
You're gonna have to pay for over sized, got it?

10
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.599
(whimpers)

11
00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.892
You ready to check your bag now?

12
00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:09.565
(whimpers)

13
00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:18.984
Next.

14
00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:20.542
<v ->Her name was Suzanne.</v>

15
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:22.441
She took my car, she took my money.

16
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.713
And she hightailed it to Fresno.

17
00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:26.686
With Lewis freaking Finklestein,

18
00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.266
that no good schmuck.

19
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.406
<v ->Triple kegger at Kappa Delta.</v>

20
00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:35.827
<v ->Checking my paranoia.</v>

21
00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:37.170
<v ->Mr. Cranstin,</v>

22
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.419
this is the third time this month.

23
00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:42.516
<v ->They're watching me.</v>

24
00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:44.629
<v ->The good news is that I get to keep the Benz</v>

25
00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.314
and the yacht.

26
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.095
The bad news is that her name is Candie,

27
00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:50.788
and she's classically trained in pole dancing.

28
00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:00.984
<v ->Next.</v>

29
00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:06.435
(bell rings)

30
00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:07.688
Next.

31
00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:13.674
<v ->First time?</v>

32
00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:15.562
<v ->Excuse me?</v>

33
00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:16.799
<v ->Have you checked your baggage before?</v>

34
00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.228
<v ->I don't think that's any of your business.</v>

35
00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:19.934
<v ->Oh come on, we're all friends here.</v>

36
00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:21.194
<v Desk Worker>Next.</v>

37
00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:22.004
<v ->I mean, it's just like</v>

38
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.156
she got so mainstream.

39
00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:24.724
<v ->Next.</v>

40
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:26.655
<v ->So.</v>

41
00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.905
Who is it?

42
00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:30.740
High school sweetheart?

43
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.398
The guy who sits next to the copier at work?

44
00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:35.955
<v ->Haven't you ever heard of privacy?</v>

45
00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.054
<v ->Oh please, you're gonna check it,</v>

46
00:02:37.054 --> 00:02:38.035
might as well complain about it

47
00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:38.963
while you still got time.

48
00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:40.531
<v ->I'd rather not.</v>

49
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:42.782
<v ->Aerobics instructor?</v>

50
00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:44.147
Next door neighbor?

51
00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.672
Oh I got it.

52
00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.016
Older, handsome college professor?

53
00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:48.595
<v ->How do you know it's a guy?</v>

54
00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:50.856
<v ->Well, this just got very interesting.</v>

55
00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.520
<v ->I meant how do you know it's a person?</v>

56
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.693
<v ->I can just tell.</v>

57
00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:54.290
<v ->Oh really?</v>

58
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.890
<v ->I've checked a lot of baggage in my time.</v>

59
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.170
<v ->Oh, can't imagine why,</v>

60
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.514
you seem like a real catch.

61
00:02:58.514 --> 00:02:59.645
<v Desk Worker>Next.</v>

62
00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:00.850
<v ->I mean, it doesn't make any sense.</v>

63
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.247
Super Nova wouldn't kill his alter ego,

64
00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:04.455
The Black Hole, in the alternate timeline

65
00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:05.221
because it goes against the continuity

66
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.662
of the entire series.

67
00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:07.995
Right?

68
00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:10.528
<v ->Next.</v>

69
00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:11.925
<v ->So what about you?</v>

70
00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.151
What are you checking?

71
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.207
<v ->Uh, me?</v>

72
00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:16.710
<v ->Don't act so shocked.</v>

73
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.986
Great.

74
00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:20.596
So you're just here to annoy people.

75
00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:21.460
Perfect.

76
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.002
<v ->Actually, I'm here to reclaim.</v>

77
00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.036
<v ->Reclaim?</v>

78
00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:26.995
<v ->My baggage.</v>

79
00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:27.807
<v ->Funny.</v>

80
00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:30.815
<v ->No, it's not.</v>

81
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.086
<v ->You want it back?</v>

82
00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:34.388
<v ->Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:34.388 --> 00:03:35.326
<v ->All of it?</v>

84
00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:35.966
The little things,

85
00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.470
the inconsiderate things,

86
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.507
the things they did just to drive you nuts,

87
00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:41.193
like leaving socks on the floor,

88
00:03:41.193 --> 00:03:44.627
or eating ice cream out of the container.

89
00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:46.536
Or the big things.

90
00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:48.936
The unforgivable things.

91
00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:50.664
Like forgetting to come to your premiere show

92
00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:51.965
at the Landmark, even though you've been

93
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.079
rehearsing for it for the past month.

94
00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.818
Or lying awake at three o'clock in the morning

95
00:03:56.818 --> 00:03:58.290
knowing that they're terrible for you,

96
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.906
but can't help who you like.

97
00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:04.242
<v ->What's his name?</v>

98
00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:10.503
What did he look like?

99
00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:12.775
<v ->He was tall.</v>

100
00:04:12.775 --> 00:04:14.417
Dark blonde hair.

101
00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:18.012
Perfect smile, could get out of just about anything.

102
00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:21.650
He did, actually.

103
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.398
What's it like?

104
00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:24.636
Checking it?

105
00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:29.009
<v ->It's like stubbing your toe</v>

106
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.717
and not feeling it sting.

107
00:04:31.717 --> 00:04:33.904
It's like eating ice cream,

108
00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:36.101
but it doesn't taste sweet.

109
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.126
Just cold and flavorless.

110
00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:43.098
You remember, but

111
00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:44.378
you don't.

112
00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:45.413
(man clears throat)

113
00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:46.427
<v ->Hey Romeo and Juliet,</v>

114
00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:47.951
you mind moving it?

115
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.192
Some of us got places to be.

116
00:04:50.192 --> 00:04:51.119
(bell rings)

117
00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.455
<v Desk Worker>Next.</v>

118
00:04:53.455 --> 00:04:54.287
<v ->Back again?</v>

119
00:04:54.287 --> 00:04:56.932
<v ->I'm here to check my temper, jerk off.</v>

120
00:04:56.932 --> 00:04:58.500
<v ->Shocker.</v>

121
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.801
<v ->Friend of yours?</v>

122
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.561
<v ->I've seen him before.</v>

123
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:03.844
That's the thing about checking your baggage.

124
00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:05.411
It's alright to do it only once.

125
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.098
I mean, I can admit it is nice

126
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.262
not having to lug around all that weight.

127
00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:10.809
<v ->Chase.</v>

128
00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:12.878
His name was Chase.

129
00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:13.796
I know,

130
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:14.829
I thought it would be romantic

131
00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:18.777
like dating the homecoming king or something.

132
00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.291
It started out so good.

133
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:21.240
<v ->It always does.</v>

134
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.808
<v ->And why do I feel so bad?</v>

135
00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:24.718
<v ->You think you're alone?</v>

136
00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:25.975
Just look around,

137
00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:28.727
it all started out so good for the people, too.

138
00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:31.063
<v ->Then what's so wrong with wanting to check it?</v>

139
00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:33.356
<v ->What's the point of living in the first place?</v>

140
00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:35.245
(bell rings)

141
00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:36.657
<v ->Next.</v>

142
00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:42.892
<v ->Hi.</v>

143
00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:44.011
<v ->Place your baggage on the scale.</v>

144
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.241
<v ->I'm here to reclaim.</v>

145
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.030
<v ->Excuse me?</v>

146
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.501
<v ->I'm here to reclaim my baggage.</v>

147
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:49.675
<v ->Sir please, I'm very busy,</v>

148
00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:51.115
so if you could just please tell me what--

149
00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:53.526
<v ->I want my baggage back.</v>

150
00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:01.101
Look, I don't want any trouble,

151
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:02.733
just my baggage.

152
00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:04.663
<v ->If you'd like to file a formal complaint--</v>

153
00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:05.794
<v ->Look, I need it back.</v>

154
00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:07.746
<v ->Sir, you're holding up the line.</v>

155
00:06:07.746 --> 00:06:09.090
<v ->Did you ever meet someone</v>

156
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.182
and just know they're perfect?

157
00:06:12.182 --> 00:06:15.084
Well, it happened to me.

158
00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:17.952
She was perfect.

159
00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:19.489
And then she broke up with me.

160
00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:21.772
<v ->Yeah, she broke your heart,</v>

161
00:06:21.772 --> 00:06:22.625
yada yada yada.

162
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.352
This isn't my first rodeo, cowboy.

163
00:06:24.352 --> 00:06:24.918
Just--

164
00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.496
<v ->That's just it, that's why it didn't work,</v>

165
00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:29.184
it's because I checked my baggage.

166
00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:31.456
<v ->Excuse me?</v>

167
00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:34.667
<v ->It was blank.</v>

168
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:36.864
I checked it all.

169
00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.016
The high school sweethearts,

170
00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:42.122
the college flings.

171
00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:42.997
Mindy Dabrowski,

172
00:06:42.997 --> 00:06:46.698
who dumped me after two hours in the fourth grade.

173
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.671
That's the thing about taking the weight

174
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.466
out of everything.

175
00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:54.580
Make's it all seem so worthless.

176
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.033
The nice things she did for me.

177
00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:00.105
All of it was lost on me.

178
00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:02.036
Lost because I was weightless,

179
00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:05.261
nothing to give her in return.

180
00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:11.735
<v ->Company policy.</v>

181
00:07:14.925 --> 00:07:17.048
<v ->There's nothing you can do?</v>

182
00:07:17.048 --> 00:07:18.178
<v ->Sir, let me tell you,</v>

183
00:07:18.178 --> 00:07:19.970
if there is one thing this company

184
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.901
takes pride in,

185
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:24.418
it's losing baggage.

186
00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:25.186
(bell rings)

187
00:07:25.186 --> 00:07:26.327
Next.

188
00:07:26.327 --> 00:07:27.714
<v ->Hey, just let me back there.</v>

189
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.687
I can look for it.

190
00:07:39.617 --> 00:07:43.014
<v ->Sir, customers are not allowed in private areas.</v>

191
00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:47.952
<v ->I told you Romeo, I got places to be.</v>

192
00:07:47.952 --> 00:07:51.066
I'm trying to check my anger.

193
00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:08.150
<v ->Sorry for wasting everyone's time.</v>

194
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.515
(bell rings)

195
00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.041
<v ->Next.</v>

196
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:37.230
(cheerful music)

197
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.765
<v ->Hi.</v>

198
00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:46.132
<v ->What happened?</v>

199
00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:48.266
<v ->I thought I'd carry it with me.</v>

200
00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:49.951
<v ->Why?</v>

201
00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:52.405
<v ->Word has it, you lost your baggage.</v>

202
00:08:52.405 --> 00:08:54.992
As it turns out, I've got enough to share.

203
00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:57.771
Shall we?

204
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:05.710
<v ->So,</v>

205
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.470
Chase, huh?

206
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.956
<v ->Yeah, he even used to play football.</v>

207
00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:10.926
<v ->Quarterback?</v>

208
00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:11.918
<v ->Tight end.</v>

209
00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.241
(laughs)

210
00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:14.403
<v ->Even worse.</v>

211
00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:16.206
<v ->Tell me about it.</v>

212
00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:17.614
(cheerful music)
