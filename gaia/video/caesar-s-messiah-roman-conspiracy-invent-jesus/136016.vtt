00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:03.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
- Who was Jesus?

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.341 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Is he a historical character?

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Who wrote the gospels?

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Why are they written in Greek?

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.267 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Why did they have a pro-Roman
perspective?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Why was the religion
headquartered in Rome?

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:25.442 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Those were the mysteries
that I saw about the gospels.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] The origin
of the Christian religion

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.698 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
has been a subject steep in
mystery for nearly 2,000 years.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.495 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(curious music)

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.209 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Joseph Atwell is one of
the number of scholars

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.628 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
today from all around the world
who are

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
questioning the historic facts

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.424 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
behind these ancient mysteries.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.262 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When examining the actual
history of this era,

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:56.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
many of the answers provided
by the church and Christian

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
scholars do not hold up
to rigorous scrutiny.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- This is really
important for our culture,

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:07.901 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to understand where
Christianity came from.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.361 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Voiceover] No doubt,
Christians have done

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
a lot of good 
for the world,

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.365 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but then there are other
Christians,

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
often the most dogmatic, who
create war...

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:22.332 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Hatred, and other harm under
the disguise of religion.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In studying how Christianity
emerged,

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.673 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
many of our scholars
agreed that it was used

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:33.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as a political tool to
control the masses of the day,

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:37.055 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and it is still being used this
way today.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- The problem is that
Christianity has been used

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
as a tool by government that
uses

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:47.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the goodness in people against
them.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.319 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
For example, support for
the wars in the Middle East

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
has been preached to
evangelical Christians

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.991 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as a way to speed up the end of
days.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is just one example
of the way that propaganda

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:05.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is used to control and
manipulate the populace.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Actually, according to my
study of the ancient text,

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:12.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the second coming of the
Christ has already occurred.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.718 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Voiceover] Maybe we
need to expand the possible

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
answers about how Christianity
originated

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and deeper questions need to be
asked.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Maybe we need to examine
what political motives

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:26.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
were behind the formation
of the Christian religion.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- I think it's a requirement
of alert citizens

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to know how the gospels were
written,

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:35.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
why they were written, who
produced them,

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
what was the purpose and back of
all this?

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:39.534 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
This is good citizenry.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Everyone should be involved in
this.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] Today, we live
on the brink of an immense

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.292 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
paradigm shift, and this modern
time

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is very parallel to the era
in which Christianity emerged.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.592 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Studying this ancient era
can give us the perspective

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
needed for coming up with
solutions to today's problems,

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:03.517 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and for helping create a better
world that we envisioned.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(triumphant music)

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- And the penny dropped, the
penny dropped

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.516 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that Jesus as a human being
never existed.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- The presentation of the Jesus
character

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
it's somewhat of a composite

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of many Messianic leaders of the
time.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Well, it's just that's
back to the drawing board,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and we'll leave aside
all of the assumptions

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of Christian history
and let's just look at

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.787 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the texts afresh and
consider every possibility.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.748 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Let's open the whole game up.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- Can you think that
Christianity is really

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.462 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Paganism by a different name?

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:16.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now, it feels completely
obvious.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:21.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- Some of us are saying
that this was a sun god

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.305 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
turned into a Jewish man.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- In all of this, we're
dealing with literature.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.102 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
We're not dealing with history.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So the answer is no, there is no
history

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.608 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to this character, Jesus.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's entirely a literary
creation.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.613 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] Some of our
Bible scholars are mavericks,

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
working outside the restrictions
of

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
mainstream religious
institutions.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This allows them the freedom
to provide fresh insights

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and draw from startling
conclusions about how

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Christianity was born.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- I began reading a number
of books on the subject.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This turned into a decade-long
research.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] For Joseph
Atwill, the key was in

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.811 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the Dead Sea Scrolls, the
only Jewish literature

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:16.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
ever discovered from the
first century AD or CE,

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the time that Jesus would've
been preaching among the Jews.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:25.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- The characters in the Dead
Sea Scrolls were militaristic,

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and you could see that
this movement wanted

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.913 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to push the foreigners out of
Israel.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They were fundamentalists,
whereas the characters

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in the gospel are different.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
They are pacifistic.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They are turning the other
cheek.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They're giving to Caesar what is
Caesar's.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.386 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
How did a movement like
Christianity

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
come to exist in a
region that was occupied

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:53.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
by Roman soldiers and had
Jewish zealots within it

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:56.356 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that were going to push these
Romans out?

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
How was that possible?

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:03.446 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I began studying the other
two major works of the era:

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The New Testament and Wars
of the Jews by Josephus,

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a Roman court historian
who described the war

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
between the Romans and the
Jews in the first century.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:16.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
While reading these works side
by side,

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I noticed an amazing
connection between them.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Certain events from the ministry
of Jesus

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
seemed to closely parallel
episodes from

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:27.929 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the military campaign of
Roman Caesar Titus Flavius,

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a campaign which took place 40
years

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.935 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
after Jesus supposedly lived.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
My efforts to understand
these connections led me

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.441 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to an incredible discovery.

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Christianity had been
invented by a little known

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
family of Roman Caesars, the
Flavians.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.868 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And they left us documents to
prove it.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- The Flavians are not a
household name,

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.878 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and yet it's the Flavians who

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.964 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
completely reshaped the Roman
Empire.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.677 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In Rome, of course, there's the
Colosseum,

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which is understood to be
the best known monument

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of the Ancient Roman Empire,
perhaps.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.769 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The Coliseum is, in fact,
a Flavian construction

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.647 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
produced during the Flavian
Period.

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:22.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's under the Flavians
that both Rabbinic Judaism

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and Christianity take shape.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Voiceover] Why would the
Flavians

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.408 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
be interested in creating
religion?

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Much like today, their era was
marked by

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
political power struggles,
a bankrupt economy,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.377 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
religious conflicts and endless
wars.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.922 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the midst of this turmoil,
the Flavians

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
seized control of the
Roman Empire and ushered in

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
an immense paradigm shift.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:54.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
To understand the Flavian's rise
to power,

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.725 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
we need to go back to the reign

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the previous powerful rulers,

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.438 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the Julio-Claudian Dynasty.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Beginning with Julius
Caesar in the year 49 BCE,

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:10.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the Julio-Claudians ruled
Rome for over 100 years,

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:14.369 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
transforming the government
from a Republic into an empire.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.665 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This family contained
all the famous Caesars.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Julius, who predated the time of
Jesus,

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Augustus who was Caesar at the
time of

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:26.965 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Jesus's supposed birth,
Tiberius,

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:30.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who ruled during Jesus's
supposed death,

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
followed by the infamous
Caligula.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Then Claudius and ending
the Julio-Claudian dynasty

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with Nero, whose reign begins in
54 CE.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- The Julio-Claudians
enjoyed a god-like status.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Until the family degenerated

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.407 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and began to damage the Roman
Empire.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] By the time of
Nero,

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
his famous decadence was
bankrupting the empire,

00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and the Jews of Judea were
staging a huge rebellion

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.667 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
against their Roman rulers.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- Judea was one of the
many conquered provinces

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that made up the Roman Empire.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This region, which was
also known as Palestine,

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:13.303 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was controlled by a family that
served as

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.055 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Rome's tax collector, The
Herods.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.977 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- They were a Greco-Arab
family, somewhat possibly

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
judiais, though only judiais

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
when it was convenient
to please the subjects

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
they were given who were
put in power in Palestine

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and destroyed the previous
Jewish-ruling family,

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Maccabean family, root and
stump.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.285 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Voiceover] Besides being
heavily taxed

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:41.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and ruled by a non-Jewish
family put in power by Rome,

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:44.292 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Jews were further
inflamed by the requirement

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.712 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that a statue of the Caesar
be placed for worship

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:51.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in every temple throughout the
empire.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:55.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- In the Roman Empire,
you could pretty much have

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:59.808 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
any god you want, but
legally, you had to submit to

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.812 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
the emperor as a god as well.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.689 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You had to at least acknowledge
that

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.902 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Roman leader was also a
divine figure.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But the Jews would not have any
of it.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- It's fundamental to Jewish
belief that you shall make

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:16.991 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
no graven images.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
It's one of the commandments and

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
given a sign by God.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.083 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So the Jews never made
representations of God.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.837 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- The Jews had a very
different type of religion.

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.672 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They had a religion which
was much more focused

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:34.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
on the book, and less
focused upon cultic statues.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This presented a real
problems for the Romans.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They tried to install statues of
Caesar,

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but the Jews weren't
going to buy that at all.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In fact, it aggravated them.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It enraged them, and
the Romans really are,

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I think, didn't understand this.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.611 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
It's not statues.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.363 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
It's books.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.574 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] And those books
contained what are known

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:01.327 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as the Jewish Messianic
prophecies.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.996 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- The thing that most moved the
Jews'

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.707 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
revolt against Rome
was an obscure prophecy

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.418 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from among their writings
that a world ruler

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
would come out of Palestine.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- Holy books inspired the Jews
to expect

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:17.969 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a redeemer who would redeem
Israel, rescue Israel,

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
restore Israel to power and
leadership in the world.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- The messiah that the
literature described

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:21%
was a
warrior.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.856 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The messiahs would have
claimed the same attributes

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the same attributes that David
did.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.444 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
David could overcome any army
because

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
God gave him the power to do it.

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
If you had the power of God,

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:44.287 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you could easily defeat the
Roman army.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The people rebelled against Rome

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.999 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and were led by a Messianic
movement that

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.794 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
had a series of messiahs
that had come forward

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:54.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to fight against the Roman
Empire.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.465 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] The Hebrew word
Messiah

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is translated into Greek
as Kristos, or Christ.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So the title of Christ can
describe any

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the numerous messiahs of this
movement.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.893 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Yes, the word Christ or
Christians

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
can refer to the Palestine
Messianic movement,

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:15.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but it's a later term,
it's a later reformulation

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of the Messianic movement of
Palestine.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Joseph] This movement
rebels against Rome

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in 66 and is successful.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It actually defeats them
militarily.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.121 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So it must've been a huge
movement.

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:30.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The victorious Jews set up a
nation state

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.336 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
directly in the Roman Empire.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.129 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- And the Romans had to
do something about it.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There was a real danger
that this Messianic movement

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.177 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
could not only boil
over into Judea itself,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but could spread to
other Jewish communities

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.349 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in other parts of the Roman
Empire.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.477 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Rome ruled its colonies
with a rod of iron,

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:53.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and any resistance was going
to be met with brute force.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.402 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Voiceover] At this time
during Nero's reign, two of the

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:01.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
finest military men in the
empire with the Flavians:

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Vespasian and son Titus.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Joseph] Vespasian and
Titus were military men.

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:09.664 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They spent a great deal of
their life outside of Rome.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.208 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
For over a decade, they had
waged war

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
against the druids in Brittany
and Gaul.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Vespasian and Titus were
successful

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.885 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in essentially destroying the
druids.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:27.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They left behind no historical
record of their existence.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- [Voiceover] And it's
the Flavians who Nero

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.978 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
calls upon when he needs to

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:35.481 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
suppress the Jew's rebellion in
Judea.

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:38.985 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Nero responded by
asking his best generals,

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:42.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Vespasians and his son
Titus to go into Judea

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
with a huge army, 60, 70,000
troops,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.413 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and a similar number of
supporting individuals.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.539 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
So they meant business.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The Romans came down
to crush the rebellion.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] In the
year 66 CE, the Flavians

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
begin their military
campaign against the Jews.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.217 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They start further north in
Galilee,

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
where the first of three
key events takes place.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.975 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They destroy the Jewish town of
Galilee.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.436 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They also captured a Jewish
rebel,

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who later becomes a critical
figure

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:18.149 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the formulation of
Christianity.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.943 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- This is where they
captured one of the leaders

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:25.907 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of the rebellion, a Jew
named Josephus Bar Mathias.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:30.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now Josephus presented himself
to the Flavians as a prophet.

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:32.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
- He survived.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:35.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He survived apparently
by telling Vespasian

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that the prophecies of
the Jews pointed out

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:41.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that Vespasian would become
emperor, and of course he did,

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so Vespasian quite liked
Josephus.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:48.262 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He used him as a translator
in his entourage.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He used him to appeal to
the rebels to surrender.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.727 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- At this point, Josephus
became a turncoat,

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:58.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and worked with the Flavians
against the rebellion.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Voiceover] Meanwhile, chaos
is increasing back in Rome,

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where Nero's rule is being
threatened.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- In the year 68, the
senate found the courage

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:13.412 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to depose Nero and he committed
suicide.

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:17.333 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now in that circumstance,
Vespasian was

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.211 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a prime candidate to become
emperor.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- [Joseph] In the middle of this
war,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Vespasian returned to Rome
and seized the throne.

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:30.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The Flavians then became
the imperial family.

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Voiceover] With
Vespasian becoming the new

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:35.601 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Caesar in Rome, Titus stays
behind on the battlefield

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and sets his sights on
Jerusalem,

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
where the other two key events
take place.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.944 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Titus encircles Jerusalem
at the wall, and finally,

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:49.115 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
he razes the temple leaving
not one stone atop another.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:51.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
- It took a while.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.453 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They eventually had to bring on
starvation

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:58.583 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
by building a wall, a barricade
entirely

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
enveloped in the city.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- What happens, of course, is
the temple,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.256 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
in 70, is completely destroyed.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- For the Jews, it was
the ultimate calamity

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.346 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because, of course, this
was the house of their god,

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:16.392 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it was destroyed by the
Romans quite thoroughly.

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:20.396 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Titus, of course, was the
victor of this great siege.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:24.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Titus carried the spoils
of this captured city

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
back to Rome for his triumph.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He took the treasures of the
temple,

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:31.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
their famous seven branch
candlestick.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:35.244 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You could see it on the
Arch of Titus in Rome.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.997 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It celebrates that tremendous
victory

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:41.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of Rome, again, triumphant
and Titus, of course,

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.544 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
is the hero of the day.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:48.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(triumphant music)

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- All of the artifacts from the
temple

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that they seized, they
put on public display

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in what to they refer to
as the Palace of Peace,

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.647 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
except for one item, the Jewish
scripture.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:06.442 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Josephus records that the
Flavians took

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.195 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and placed in their private
palace,

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.114 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
where no one was allowed to see
it.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:15.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] Although Titus
Flavius

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.162 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
successfully ended the rebellion
in Judea,

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:21.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
another rebellion soon broke
out in Alexandria, Egypt.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.877 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The Flavians were clear
that this was not the end

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.546 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of the Jewish Messianic
movement.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.174 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They also recognized that
it was the Jews' Messianic

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:34.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
literature that was fueling this
movement.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.555 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So once they captured
the Jewish scripture,

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they had all other copies of it
destroyed.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Joseph] And that's
why the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
had to have been buried
in a cave because that was

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:48.067 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the only way it could be safe
from the Roman destruction.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There was not a single scrap of
literature

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
found from the Messianic
movement

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
until the scrolls were
discovered.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.285 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That's why they're such a
treasure because

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.203 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
they're the only real voice

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:02.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the Messianic movement that
we have.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:05.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] And the real
voice of the Jew's Messianic

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
movement, according to our
scholars,

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.588 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
was violent and militaristic,

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:14.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
not the pacifistic version
depicted in the gospels.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- War against Rome was a
Messianic war.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So that's why I say that
the scrolls are not only

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.726 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the literature of the Messianic
movement in Palestine,

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:25.187 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they're also the literature
of the war against Rome.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:26.397 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Voiceover] The Romans needed
to

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:27.982 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
subdue the Jes' religion.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:31.861 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So they set about influencing
it and changing it.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- They realized they can't
destroy

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.072 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
the Jewish religion altogether.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:36.157 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
That's not their objective.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They realized, they're
sensible enough to realize

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that they can't do that.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:43.497 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So what you have to do is try
to create a type of Judaism

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:47.626 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that is benign and it's
exactly coinciding with the

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
rise of the Flavian dynasty is
the arrival

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:54.216 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of two benign forms of Jewish
ideology.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Voiceover] It's during this
period that a new literature

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.266 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
enters history which
describes a peace-loving,

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
turn the other cheek preaching

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:07.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Jewish messiah named Jesus
Christ.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:10.691 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But if the Flavians wrote the
gospels,

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.194 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
how could a Roman family know
how to write

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:16.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Jewish literature that
refers to Jewish prophecy?

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:19.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The answer lies in the
Flavian's collaborations

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with a number of Jewish
intellectuals,

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:26.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
beginning with their own
court historian Josephus.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.043 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- Josephus arrives back
in Rome with Titus.

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He becomes an adopted member
of the Flavian family,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.801 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
an amazing turn of events
for the Jewish turncoat.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
He becomes Flavius Josephus.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Josephus, at this time,
begins writing the history

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:48.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the war, and he records
that Titus gave him

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.399 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
the Jewish scripture.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Josephus's histories has
always been associated

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.529 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with the origins of
Christianity.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.906 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- Time and again you could find
parallels

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
between what Josephus writes

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and what turns up in the
Gospels.

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:07.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's a powerful evidence
of their true origin.

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:09.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] In reading
the works of Josephus

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:12.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
side-by-side with the
gospels, scholars have noticed

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
parallels between the two works.

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.341 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It appears as though
the history of Josephus

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.177 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
records events that
fulfill the prophecies of

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.304 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the Old and New Testaments.

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:25.683 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Early Christians
understood this connection.

00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:28.227 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In fact, when the Bible
first began to be printed

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:33.107 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the Middle Ages, it included
the history of Josephus.

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:34.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
- He was employed to write

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the official history that we
have.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.945 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The other histories from this
period

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:41.615 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
have been destroyed
ruthlessly by the Romans.

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:44.452 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Josephus tells us this
in very chilling passages

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.246 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
how the Romans exerted complete
control

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.914 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of the literature of this
period.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.375 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There were alternative
histories of the Jewish war

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:54.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
written while the Romans
rounded up the writers

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:57.339 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of those histories and executed
them.

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:00.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
They rounded up all the copies

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:03.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of those histories and destroyed
them.

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That is to say they ruthlessly
wiped out

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:08.976 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
any alternative history so
that the only history we have

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:13.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is written by Josephus, and
let's remember who Josephus was.

00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:16.984 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- Chief propagandist
of the Flavian dynasty.

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.152 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
He was very, very successful.

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
He moved back to Rome.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:23.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He was given an apartment in
the emperor's own townhouse,

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and he was appointed
the Chronicler

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
of the Roman
Jewish War

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:31.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
using Vespasian's own
diaries of the events.

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:33.834 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] Also in
the pages of his history,

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:37.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Josephus declares that the Jew's
messiah

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:39.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
or Christ is none other than

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:43.385 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Flavius Vespasian and his
dynastic family.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- To put it succinctly, Josephus
says that

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.057 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
there was a prophecy that a
world ruler

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
would come out of Palestine.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Jews thought this
applied to one of their own.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They were wrong in their
interpretation.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He uses the most cynical
interpretation.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.528 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
He applied it to the rise

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.905 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of the Roman Emperor in
Palestine.

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:06.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- Josephus recorded that
the Messianic prophecies

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:10.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
foresaw not a Jew, but
Vespasian and his dynasty.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:15.668 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In fact, all of the
Flavian historians recorded

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:18.921 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that the Flavian Caesar was the
Christ.

00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:23.259 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] It was
important to the Flavians

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that they be seen as the Christ,
asdivine

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:29.807 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and god-like and this was not
mere vanity.

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The Julio-Cladians before them
had already

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.813 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
established that presenting
themselves as Gods

00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:39.942 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
was a powerful tool in
controlling their subjects.

00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When the Flavians took over the
throne,

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they inherited an enormous
bureaucracy

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:48.367 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that was already in
place, the Imperial Cult,

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:52.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which was dedicated to promoting
the idea

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:53.956 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of Caesar as a god.

00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:03.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- Another part of the puzzle
is the Roman Imperial Cult.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Why is it important?

00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Well, because it coincides
with that same period of time

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as the emergence of the Christ
cult.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- You had a whole social
community,

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:16.228 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the whole social structure of
these conquered territories

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
was governed by the Imperial
Cult and

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:21.275 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
if you wanted to succeed,
the key social community

00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:23.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to drive was the Imperial Cult
because

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that's where all the
movements and shakers were.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.075 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- This idea of the emperor
becoming an object of worship

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
was well-established in the
Roman system

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
before Vespasian and Titus came
along.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.585 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It was prevalent in all major
centers.

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It had its own priesthood.

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:44.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There was a ceremony,
an annual celebration,

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:47.176 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
annual games for the Imperial
Cult.

00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:51.347 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Now it had many characteristics

00:23:51.347 --> 00:23:55.559 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which would later color
the Christian cult.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It grew in the same centers.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It made claims that were
later transferred to Christ.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:04.068 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- The Julio-Claudians had
claimed that they were

00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:07.571 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of divine descent and that they
were, therefore, legitimate.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.531 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Their appeal base was the

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Roman aristocracy, the Roman
nobility.

00:24:12.493 --> 00:24:16.705 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
All of that collapsed
into this power vacuum.

00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:19.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Vespesian was declared
emperor by the troops,

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:21.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
by the Roman army.

00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:25.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So effectively, it was a
military coup.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:28.926 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
With the change of dynasty,
they have to create

00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:32.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a whole mythology to
legitimize that dynasty.

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
At the same time they're
creating a whole

00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:38.435 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
mythology to counter Jewish
Messianism.

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:39.269 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Somewhere along the line,

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
those two things get mixed
together.

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.859 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- When Vespasian died,
Titus began the process

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:47.653 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of having his father deified.

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is a complicated process
because

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.908 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
only the Roman senate can
bestow on an individual

00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:54.993 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the title of Deus or God.

00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:59.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Titus came to the senate
and presented evidence

00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.792 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that the life of his
father had been divine.

00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:04.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Certainly, this would have
included the military campaign

00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:07.673 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that the Flavians waged through
Judea.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.426 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
And it's at this time, I think,

00:25:10.426 --> 00:25:12.136 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that the gospels were written

00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:14.888 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because the theological
structure

00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:19.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the gospels of a god, the
father and the son of God

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is the same one that Titus would
have been

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.273 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
presenting to the Roman Senate.

00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:28.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Well, the Roman senate did
accept Titus's evidence

00:25:29.403 --> 00:25:32.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and Vespaian was deified and
became a god.

00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:37.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Titus, therefore, became a son
of God.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:44.835 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] The Arch of
Titus that still stands

00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:47.379 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in modern Rome today is
inscribed

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.424 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to the dedication to the Divine
Titus, son

00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:53.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the Divine Vespasian or Son
of a God.

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:59.099 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This Imperial Cult set up
to worship Caesar as God

00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:01.894 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
also provided the basis for the
structure

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.938 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of the Roman Catholic Church.

00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:07.733 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Now the rituals,
paraphernalia and symbols

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:10.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of Paganism were transferred
wholesale

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:12.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to the Christian church.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The most obvious and clear
example

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:19.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is where the title of the
Pagan chief, priest of Rome,

00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:23.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the Pontifex Maximus, became the
title

00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the pope, the Christian pope.

00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:31.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If you look at who held
the original bishop

00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:34.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
positions in the Catholic
church in those early times,

00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
you will see that they are

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.306 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
members of the same Pagan
aristocracy.

00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:42.935 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They simply changed their
clothing a little bit.

00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:44.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They wore the same garments,

00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:47.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but they wore slightly
different headdresses.

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:50.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They had became from being
a priest of a Pagan cult

00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:53.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to being a priest of Rome.

00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
- Where the Vatican now stands,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
there was once a Pagan temple,

00:26:57.032 --> 00:27:00.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which celebrated the mysteries
of a dying and resurrecting

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:02.412 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
God man who wasn't Jesus.

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:05.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
There are many churches in Rome.

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:08.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I've been to a few where
you go above into the church

00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:11.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and there's Jesus, and
you go underneath and

00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:14.299 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there's a little sanctuary of
Mithras,

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:17.719 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it's basically the same
figure.

00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:20.889 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- So the Roman plot to invent
Christianity

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:24.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is just so clever when you think
about it.

00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:29.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Through the pope, who is
God's representative on Earth,

00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:33.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they no longer needed
expensive standing armies,

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:36.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
wars and punishment of
disobedient peasants.

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:40.784 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They could, through religion,
rule their subjects.

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:47.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] Over
time, Roman Christianity

00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
propagated over the empire
by way of the mass media

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the day, the Roman roads.

00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:57.551 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Romans must have
approved of this new religion

00:27:57.551 --> 00:27:59.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because, as some scholars ask,

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:02.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
"If the gospels really
were Jewish literature

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"about a Roman sentenced
criminal,

00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:08.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"why wouldn't they have been
destroyed?"

00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- One of the really
surprising things for me

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:14.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
was to realize the extent of
Roman control

00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:17.863 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of propaganda and literature.

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:20.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So that when you suddenly
get all these Christian

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:22.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
literature arising in this
period,

00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:25.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
one has to ask, "Well,
how did that happen?"

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:26.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The conclusion that one has to
reach

00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:29.207 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
is that that could not have
happened

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
without some degree of
complicity

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:35.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
on the part of the Romans.

00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:38.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So then one is lead to the
conclusion

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:41.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that the Romans must be involved

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the production of these
literature.

00:28:50.312 --> 00:28:52.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] To produce and
disseminate this literature

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:55.067 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was a huge under-taking and the
Flavians

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
undoubtedly had collaborators.

00:28:57.486 --> 00:29:00.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We know they were funded
by the wealthiest family

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:04.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the world at this time, the
Alexanders,

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
a Jewish family who served as

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.956 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Rome's tax collectors in Egypt.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.376 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Like the Herods in Judea, the
Alexanders

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:16.296 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
had strong motivation to keep
the Jew's Messianic movement

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:20.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from threatening their
position and their wealth.

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:23.595 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
One of their family members
was Philo of Alexandria,

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:26.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a famous Jewish theologian who
was already

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:28.934 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
writing works that combined
Jewish beliefs

00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:33.438 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with the modern Greek and
Roman pagan beliefs of the day.

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Many scholars agree that his
writings

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:39.945 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
formed the basis for much of
the philosophy of Christianity.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.118 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- In these pages is
practically every concept

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that you can find within
Christianity.

00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.831 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
He combined Greek philosophy,

00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:55.335 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and he took that and
combined it with Judaism.

00:29:55.335 --> 00:30:00.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
On top of that, he was from
an extremely wealthy family,

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:03.218 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and this is important because
you have to

00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
follow the money when you're
looking at

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:07.889 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
major trends, new paradigms
being set.

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And if you look at his family,
then,

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.643 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you start seeing, "Well,
this is interesting because

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:15.814 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"now we're starting to come
across the Flavians again."

00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:20.068 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
His relatives are very
involved with the Flavians.

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.237 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
That whole area is where we
want to look very closely

00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:23.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
for the Christian origins.

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- It's from exactly the
same circle of people

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.288 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that you get the first
signs of Christian ideology

00:30:31.288 --> 00:30:35.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and they all lead to the
rise of the Flavian dynasty.

00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.257 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] Another wealthy
influential character,

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:46.178 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Princess Berenice, was from
the Herod family in Judea.

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:49.097 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
She's the granddaughter of Hera
the Great,

00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:51.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a product of the Herod's
intermarriage

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:55.687 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with the conquered Jewish
ruling Messianic lineage.

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.524 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- Princess Berenice appears
in the New Testament,

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:01.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which makes her an interesting
character.

00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.737 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
She had two or three husbands

00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:06.907 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and then became the mistress of
Titus.

00:31:07.949 --> 00:31:12.579 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So you can see this, again,
rather-like dynasty here.

00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You know, powerful
people, mixed marriages.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You know, checking up with the
conqueror.

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:22.130 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Yeah, and it's really where
Joe Atwill takes his idea

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the conspiracy to
write the New Testament.

00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:29.179 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But let him say it in his own
words.

00:31:29.179 --> 00:31:31.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- Berenice was a Herod related
by marriage

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.725 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to the Alexanders, and of
course, later,

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:36.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
she became the mistress to
Titus.

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The fact that she was so
closely linked with the Flavians

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:42.109 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
shows you that the three
families were very unified

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:46.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in financial, romantic and
likely theological issues.

00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:48.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- By the looks of things, this
coalescence

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:51.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
seemed to have brought about a
dynamic

00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:54.621 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that led to the synthesis
of Judaism and Paganism,

00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:57.082 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and eventually became
Christianity.

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:59.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So this is a very key time
period.

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- I believe that the gospels
were actually

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:06.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
written under the control of the
Herods,

00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the Alexanders and the Flavians.

00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:11.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
These families 
had the motivation

00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:12.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
to create
Christianity

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:16.643 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and with the expertise in
Judaism that the Alexanders

00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the Herods had, they
had the actual technical

00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.109 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
ability to come up with these
stories

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:26.903 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that were a fulfillment
of Hebraic prophecies.

00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] So it seems the
Flavians had

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.075 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the motivation, the means
and the collaborations

00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:34.828 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
through which they likely
constructed

00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:37.873 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and began disseminating
Christianity.

00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:40.792 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And if our scholars are
correct, one of the documents

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:44.462 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they left behind are
the gospels themselves.

00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:48.341 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(curious music)

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- I began working on
the study of the Gospels

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in the 1970s, and I look at
texts in terms

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.393 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of how were these composed,
what does understanding

00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:01.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
their structure tell
you about who wrote them

00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and why they were written.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.026 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
These texts were not
independent Jewish texts,

00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:08.486 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but they were created
as literary works using

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
classical literature models.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.867 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- If we expect that this is the
testimony

00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:16.661 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of witnesses, we've got a major
problem.

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:20.916 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We actually have four anonymous
documents.

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:23.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They were not written by the
named people

00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
on those documents.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is simply church
tradition that the gospels

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are so named according to
Mark, according to Matthew.

00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:37.515 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So this idea that the gospels
are reliable testimony

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.643 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
is patent nonsense.

00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- Why are the gospels called
gospels?

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.356 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
That's a critical question.

00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The word gospel in Greek is
Evangelion,

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and it means good news
of military victory.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.282 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Whose military victory are we
celebrating

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
here in these gospels?

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Well, seems to me that we are
celebrating,

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
clearly, the Roman
military victory because

00:34:01.248 --> 00:34:03.917 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
these events, the Battle of
Gadara,

00:34:03.917 --> 00:34:05.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the Battle of the later Galilee,

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:07.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the success at the Battle of
Jerusalem,

00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
these are battles that the
Romans won.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:14.261 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Why are the gospels celebrating
battles that the Jews lost

00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:17.722 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
if these things were written by
the Jews?

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:21.142 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- The fact that the gospels
are known to us in Greek

00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:24.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and not in Aramaic or Hebrew, is
I think,

00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:28.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
just evidence of their
authorship.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:31.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They were not written by
any followers of Jesus,

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who would've surely spoken
Aramaic,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and if they had been
fisherman and simple folk,

00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:38.785 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they would not have
had the literary skills

00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:40.537 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
to write them anyway.

00:34:40.537 --> 00:34:41.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] If we look
closely,

00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:43.999 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
there actually are clues in the
gospels

00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:47.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that point to who the true
authors were.

00:34:47.168 --> 00:34:49.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- A lot of the Christian
literature advocates

00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:53.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
turning away from the Jewish
law and obeying Roman law.

00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:55.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Well this, this fits perfectly

00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:57.679 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
into Roman propaganda purposes.

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:01.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then you have, in general,
the portrayal of Jesus

00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:04.436 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as the peaceful Jew
who is wandering around

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:08.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in what is depicted as
sort of a pastor or saint,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
talking to fisherman and
farmers and so forth,

00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:13.903 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
when in fact, this is a war
zone.

00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:17.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Judea is a war zone, and you ask
yourself,

00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:20.201 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
"Well, why is it not
portrayed as a war zone?"

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- I mean, they really had it
down pad

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.165 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because they had Jesus
saying, "Render unto Caesar

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:27.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"what is Caesar's", which is
basically

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:29.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in response to talking about
money.

00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:32.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Whose benefit would that be?

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It's so blatantly obvious.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.092 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- The perception of Roman
characters

00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:38.595 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in the gospels, they're all
interpreted

00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:40.096 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
in a favorable light.

00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:42.432 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
They are pro-Roman.

00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:46.227 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They do not depict the
Romans as the forces of evil.

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:47.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
They reverse that.

00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:51.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's the Jews who become
the forces of darkness.

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:56.404 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's very striking that various
passages

00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:58.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in the gospels refer to the Jews

00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:02.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
as some people separate from

00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:05.080 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the heroes of Jesus and his
disciples.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The Jews are those who object.

00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:11.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The Jews are those who try
to thwart the divine plan.

00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:14.255 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now that gives us a clue,
certainly,

00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:17.759 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to who were the true authors of
this book.

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:21.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- They are works of literature
created by

00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:24.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
people who are trained
in Jewish literature

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.435 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
but whose values are pro-Roman.

00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:31.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- The Romans wanted to
promote Antisemitism,

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:34.734 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and so they bring the story
of the beloved man god,

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:37.779 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Jesus Christ, to appear as if

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:40.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Jews had brought about his
death.

00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:43.701 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Because of this, the Jews would
have to

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:46.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
suffer Antisemitism throughout
history.

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:51.042 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- So this was a piece of work
that could not have been done

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
except by fairly
established literary team,

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
such as the literary team that
was in Rome

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.717 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
actually writing the books of
Josephus.

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean, that was written
by a literary team,

00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:04.806 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and it was written as one of the
attempts

00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:08.309 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to give prominence to the
Flavian Caesars,

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.813 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
which the gospels obviously do.

00:37:11.813 --> 00:37:13.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So it is extremely likely that
the gospels

00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.901 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as a form of epic designed to
magnify

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
allegorically, the Roman
Caesars,

00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:25.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is also written at the court
of the Flavian emperors.

00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:28.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Voiceover] But the Jesus
story takes place many decades

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.416 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
before the Flavians came to
power.

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Why would the Flavians create a
work about

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a Jewish Messiah that wasn't
even from their own era?

00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:43.052 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- The gospels were very
precisely backdated 40 years.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Jesus's ministry was started in
30 CE,

00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
exactly 40 years from the
destruction from the temple.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His ministry ends at Passover,
33 CE,

00:37:56.483 --> 00:37:59.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is 40 years before the
end of the Jewish-Roman War,

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which occurred at
Passover in 73 CE with the

00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:05.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
famous battle of Masada.

00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
- The gospels are backdated into

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.665 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
the period of Pontius Pilate.

00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.834 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That is to say before
the first Jewish war,

00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is to say, in the
Julio-Claudian period.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But this is typical of Flavian
literature.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.176 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
It's a Flavian technique.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:27.597 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What they do is backdate
the story into the period

00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:31.309 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of their enemies, namely,
the Julio-Claudians.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:35.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And so, generation after
generation of Christian scholars

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:39.067 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and even secular historians
go hunting in the

00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:43.029 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Julio-Claudian period for
the origins of the gospels.

00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:45.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They don't really find any
answers there.

00:38:45.532 --> 00:38:48.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There are allusions in the
gospels

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:50.537 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to the destruction of the
temple,

00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:52.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the most reasonable answer
to that is that these

00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:55.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
texts were written after the
destruction of the temple.

00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:58.127 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That is to say in the Flavian
period,

00:38:58.127 --> 00:39:00.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
after the change of dynasty.

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:02.924 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] This backdating
of the story of Jesus Christ

00:39:02.924 --> 00:39:05.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
40 years earlier from the time
the gospels

00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:08.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
may actually have been written
explains

00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:11.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
why many of the prophecies
of Jesus came true

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:13.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
within exactly 40 years.

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
- What does this all add up to?

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In my view, the thing that
is the most significant

00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:23.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
is the research by Joseph Atwill

00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:25.071 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
in his book Caesar's Messiah,

00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:28.575 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which suggests that the
gospels were actually

00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:32.412 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
created as works of Roman
propaganda

00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:34.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
at the end of the Roman-Jewish
war

00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:36.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
under the reign of the Flavian
emperors,

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:40.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that is Titus Caesar and
Vespasian Caesar.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And if you end up worshiping
Jesus,

00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
what you will really end up
doing

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.303 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is worshiping Caesar in
disguise.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:51.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Voiceover] This may
have been how the Flavians

00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:54.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
finally got the Jews to
worship Caesar as a god,

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
by giving them Jesus Christ,

00:39:57.687 --> 00:40:00.648 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a Messiah more to the Roman's
liking.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:04.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But is there any actual
history to this character?

00:40:04.193 --> 00:40:07.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Where did he really come from?

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:10.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- The mystery, to me,
begins with his very name.

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:14.287 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In Greek, Jesus means savior
and Christ means the messiah.

00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:16.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This didn't strike me as
something

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.916 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
you would call a young child.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.170 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- These two words are already
important

00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:28.801 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
within Judaism before Jesus
Christ supposedly existed.

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:35.016 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Major biblical figures to
a Jewish Greek-speaking

00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:38.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
populace would already be called
Christ.

00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:40.688 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Their ears would already be
acclimated

00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to accepting this title.

00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:46.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So it isn't just a unique name

00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:50.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of a single person that
just suddenly popped up.

00:40:50.073 --> 00:40:53.868 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- What did we actually know
abut Jesus Christ the man?

00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:57.664 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- I don't think that Jesus
can be historically defended.

00:40:57.664 --> 00:40:59.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I don't think there's
any evidence that we can

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
extend to that particular Jesus.

00:41:02.877 --> 00:41:06.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- So when you actually
set out to investigate

00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:10.677 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the historical Jesus as
opposed to the Christ of faith,

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.555 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
you very abruptly enter a void.

00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:18.476 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You find that whereas you might
imagine

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:21.521 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the core details of
Jesus are readily known

00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:25.692 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and accessible, you actually
discover there's no such thing.

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:30.279 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- Further, there had never been
any archaeological evidence

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:33.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of Jesus Christ that had
ever been discovered.

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- You cannot find an
established and incontrovertible

00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:40.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
biooraphy of Jesus at all.

00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:41.958 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
It doesn't exist.

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:46.129 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You enter a strange Twilight
Zone of early Christian belief.

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:50.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What we have here is not a
movement

00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that's grown on the accretion
of legends on a real

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
flesh and blood man, but
instead, the development

00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:03.479 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of a religious movement
around the idea of a man.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.232 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] There isn't
even an actual physical

00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:10.403 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
description of what Jesus looks
like anywhere in the gospel.

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:14.657 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- The presentation of the Jesus
character,

00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:17.160 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
it's somewhat of a composite of

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.872 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
many Messianic leaders of the
time.

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:22.290 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Many Messianic leaders of the
time,

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.376 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
most or all of whom came to a
bad end,

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:28.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
usually by crucifixion because
crucifixion

00:42:28.755 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was the Roman punishment
for seditious activity.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- And the penny dropped, the
penny dropped

00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:37.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that Jesus, as a human
being, never existed.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.768 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- In all of this, we're
dealing with literature.

00:42:41.768 --> 00:42:43.269 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
We're not dealing with history.

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:46.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So the answer is, no there is no
history

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.025 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to this character of Jesus.

00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:51.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's entirely a literary
creation.

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:54.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Joseph] What the Romans
did was they saw the Jews'

00:42:54.864 --> 00:42:56.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
reliance and belief in prophecy.

00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:59.869 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So they said, "Okay, they want a
prophet.

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:01.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
"Let's give them one."

00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:03.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] It seems
that in the construction

00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:05.958 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the literary character Jesus
Christ,

00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:08.753 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the Roman authors borrowed
religions concepts

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:12.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
not only from Judaism,
but also from other gods

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:14.217 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and religions that they knew.

00:43:14.217 --> 00:43:16.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Some scholars have
noticed the similarities

00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:20.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
between the story of Jesus and
the ancient Pagan mysteries.

00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:26.979 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- In ancient mythology,
we find this whole strain

00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:29.148 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of thought called Solar
mythology.

00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:31.692 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Many gods start taking on solar
attributes

00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:34.487 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because as agricultural
communities

00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:38.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
become more important, the
sun becomes the big focus

00:43:38.658 --> 00:43:42.286 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for the most obvious reason
of planting and harvesting.

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:44.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The sun is then personified.

00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:46.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So now we have a male sun god.

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:52.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Becomes a religion in
many parts of the world.

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Christianity usurped a
tremendous amount

00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:59.595 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of sun worship. Some of us 
are saying that this was

00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:02.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
a sun God turned 
into a Jewish man.

00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:07.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
This December 25th birthday was,

00:44:07.019 --> 00:44:09.897 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
in fact, the Winter Solstice.

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:12.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is really, in fact, the God
of Light.

00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:15.152 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
December 25th actually is the
end

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:18.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of a three-day period of
when the sun stands still.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:22.368 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The sun appears to be dying
as the days become shorter,

00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:25.371 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the sun is reborn at that
point.

00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:30.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Across the ancient
world, there was this form

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:33.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of experiential and
philosophical spirituality

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:35.798 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in these mystery cults or
mystery schools.

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:38.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And at the center of these
schools,

00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:43.514 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you would find a mythos
which was an initiatory myth,

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:46.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
so symbolic myth, which
would help people who were

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
going through the initiating
process come to the

00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:51.105 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
spiritual awakenings knowledge.

00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:52.815 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
This, they called Gnosis.

00:44:52.815 --> 00:44:55.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And what you see in these
myths is the elements

00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.279 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that would later become the
Jesus story.

00:44:58.279 --> 00:45:01.449 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Let's ask the question,
"Is Jesus developed

00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:04.785 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"from pre-existing literary
characters?"

00:45:05.912 --> 00:45:09.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Jesus has certain episodes
in this so-called life

00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.876 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and each one of them can be
traced

00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:15.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to a prior representation of
that time.

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.383 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- If you look at the
elements which we found

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:23.012 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in the Pagan mystery school
myths,

00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:25.097 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you find the story of a
dying and resurrecting

00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:27.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
son of God whose born of a
virgin,

00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:33.272 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has 12 disciples, turns
water into wine at a wedding.

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.858 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He brings a new religion of
love,

00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:39.987 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is accused of heresy or
provocation by the authorities.

00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:45.242 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He's put to death,
sometimes by crucifixion.

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.787 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And then if you want to
commune with the god man,

00:45:47.787 --> 00:45:49.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
you take bread and wine and then

00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.123 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
you can come to eternal life.

00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:54.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Well, all of this is,
of course, Christianity.

00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:58.839 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- Easter itself is a long
pre-Christian celebration

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:03.636 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the resurrection of spring
from the death of winter.

00:46:03.636 --> 00:46:04.971 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- This is an ancient Shamanic
rite

00:46:04.971 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you'll find all over the
world, but you go through a

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ritual death where you get
reborn,

00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:12.603 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but you're reborn as an awake
being.

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So you died just to your lower
nature,

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:17.692 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and you're woken up to a higher
nature.

00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:21.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(soft flute music)

00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:23.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- You can find them in the Old
Testaments

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:26.033 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the Jewish mythology as
well.

00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:28.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It isn't just Pagan parallels.

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:30.121 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I mean the New Testament,
for example, the Ascension.

00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:33.624 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We have an ascension with
the Old Testament figure

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:37.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of Elijah, and it's a
very dramatic ascension.

00:46:37.837 --> 00:46:39.672 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
- Elisha, Elijah cycle.

00:46:39.672 --> 00:46:42.675 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
These are two Jewish
prophets, one followed on

00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:45.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from the other which have many
of

00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:49.890 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the story elements found in
Jesus.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.561 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For example, there is a
multiplication of food miracle.

00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:55.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There is a raising of the dead
miracle.

00:46:55.938 --> 00:46:58.024 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
There is a water miracle.

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:03.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There is an, ultimately, an
ascension to heaven miracle.

00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:07.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Is this fulfillment or is this

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
simply copying of a useful
theme?

00:47:13.414 --> 00:47:16.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- You can see where they
just used Old Testament

00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:19.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
characters and scriptures as a
blueprint

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:22.048 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to create this new one.

00:47:22.048 --> 00:47:24.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- A lot of the ethics
of Christianity actually

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:26.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
were around before Christianity.

00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:29.221 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you

00:47:29.221 --> 00:47:31.515 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is in fact from the Old
Testaments.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.517 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
So Jesus didn't make that up.

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:36.562 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Many of the other aspects
of Christian ethics,

00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:39.565 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
many things which we might like
to applaud

00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:41.859 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as very good aspects of
Christian ethics

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:45.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
can be found in the
Stoic philosophy in Rome,

00:47:45.404 --> 00:47:49.033 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which, by the way, is
exactly the philosophical

00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:53.454 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and ethical school
promoted by the Flavians.

00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:56.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- There's little that
is original about Jesus.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
If one separates from his words,

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:02.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
advice that was in the
interest of the Roman Imperial

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:05.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
family, all that you have left
are

00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:08.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
snippets of widely known
philosophies,

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:11.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
truisms and concepts that came
directly

00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:15.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
from prior Hebraic literature.

00:48:15.267 --> 00:48:18.437 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- The reason I am now
convinced there's no historical

00:48:18.437 --> 00:48:20.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Jesus, which seems a real, like,
whoa,

00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:22.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to people that are not
familiar with the idea

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.568 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
is a combination of things.

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:28.697 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
First of all, there's no
evidence for a historical man

00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:31.492 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which stands up to proper
scrutiny.

00:48:31.492 --> 00:48:34.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Secondly is the story of Jesus
is

00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:40.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
full of these motifs which
come from the Pagan mysteries,

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:43.754 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the third reason is because
in the

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.757 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
early Christian movement,
there's these two types

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of Christians, certainly
by the second century,

00:48:49.135 --> 00:48:52.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which are, I think of as
Gnostics and Literalists.

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What marks out the
Literalists, who will become

00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:56.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the Roman Empire and the
Roman Catholic Church

00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:59.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is that they've got a historical
man.

00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:01.730 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What marks out the
Gnostics is that they see

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it allegorically and their great
heresy

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:05.860 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is that Christ didn't come into
flesh.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.445 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Now, the winners write history,

00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:14.201 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the history books have been
written by the Literalists.

00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:16.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- And all of the tradition about
the

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:20.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Romans trying to torture
and suppress Christians,

00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.042 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
these traditions are correct.

00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:25.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They definitely persecuted the
Messianic

00:49:25.087 --> 00:49:28.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
militaristic Christians and they
certainly

00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:31.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
would have frowned on the
Gnostic independent thinking

00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:34.680 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Christians, but the Roman
pacifistic

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.766 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
giving to Caesar what
is Caesar Christians,

00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:39.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that group would have been
promoted.

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:41.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- Which makes it perfect
for the Roman Empire,

00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:43.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and it's a fascist empire.

00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:45.149 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It's got a very simple message.

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:46.275 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
"Just believe this.

00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:48.027 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
"You don't have to transform,

00:49:48.027 --> 00:49:49.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"and you have to go
through the authorities,

00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:53.949 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
"through the bishops, through
the states, ultimately."

00:49:54.909 --> 00:49:57.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's the perfect thing
for them to pick up,

00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:59.163 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and that's what they did.

00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Voiceover] Our scholars
agree that the gospels

00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:06.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
are complex literary
creations, drawing from both

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:10.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Pagan and Jewish myth,
but Joseph Atwill goes

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a step further to say
that the Flavians wrote

00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:16.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
passages directly into
the gospels which show

00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:18.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
they were the authors.

00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- One of the most famous
prophecies that Jesus makes

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is about the coming of someone

00:50:31.946 --> 00:50:33.739 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
he refers to as the son of man.

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:37.534 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Now many people believe
that he's talking about

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:40.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a second coming of
himself, and many people

00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:44.083 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
believe this was going to
occur some point in the future.

00:50:44.083 --> 00:50:46.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Well, the fact is, this coming

00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:49.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of Jesus has already occurred.

00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:51.966 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Jesus makes very specific
prophecies

00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:53.425 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
as to what will happen when

00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:55.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the son of man makes his
visitation.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He refers to three key events:

00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:01.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The Galilean towns will
be crushed, Jerusalem

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
will be encircled with a wall,
and the temple will be razed,

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
leaving not one stone atop
another.

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:12.736 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He also states exactly when
this individual will come.

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:16.156 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He says that the son of
man will appear before

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:18.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the generation that is alive

00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:21.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and listening to Jesus's
words passes away.

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:26.083 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now to Jews of this era,
a generation is 40 years.

00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:30.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so the only individual
that could possibly be

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:34.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the son of man that Jesus
predicts is Titus Flavius.

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:38.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Titus Flavius did destroy
the Gallilean towns.

00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:42.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He did encircle Jerusalem with a
wall,

00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:46.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and he razed the temple and
left not one stone atop another.

00:51:48.397 --> 00:51:51.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And he did this within 40 years.

00:51:55.988 --> 00:51:59.408 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Josephus recorded that no
matter how Titus tortured

00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:04.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the Jews, they refused
to call him lord or God.

00:52:04.038 --> 00:52:05.873 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So to circumvent this
stubbornness,

00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:10.336 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the Flavians wrote the
gospels in which a son of man

00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:13.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
was predicted to come in the
future.

00:52:13.047 --> 00:52:17.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Titus fulfilled these prophecies
and became the son of man.

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:22.598 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So you end up worshiping
Titus without knowing it.

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Voiceover] To further
support his thesis

00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:32.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that the Flavians originated
Christianity,

00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:35.527 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Joseph Atwill points to
the Roman Catholic Church's

00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
earliest saints known as
the Christian Flavians.

00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:48.999 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- The Flavian family is
connected to

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.502 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
early Christianity in a
number of unusual ways.

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:53.796 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So many members of the
family were recorded

00:52:53.796 --> 00:52:57.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
as having been among the
first Roman Catholic saints.

00:52:57.424 --> 00:53:01.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
These include Flavia
Domitilla, who is either

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:05.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Titus's sister or his niece,
and there is an inscription

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:09.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
honoring Flavia for donating
the land that became

00:53:09.812 --> 00:53:13.482 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the first Christian catacomb,
and Flavia Domitilla

00:53:13.482 --> 00:53:15.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
was the first Christian saint.

00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:20.531 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Her son, Clement, is
recorded as having been

00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:24.660 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the first Roman Catholic
pope after the apostle Simon.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:29.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In addition, there were
two members of the Flavian

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:32.334 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
household staff, Nereus and
Achilleus.

00:53:33.752 --> 00:53:36.296 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Both of them had churches named
after them

00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:40.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the very earliest
Christian Diocese in Rome.

00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:45.597 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There was a Christian
theologian whose name was

00:53:45.597 --> 00:53:49.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Titus Flavius Clemens,
Clement of Alexandria,

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.771 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and he's the one who actually
described

00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.649 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the first christian symbols and
he said

00:53:55.649 --> 00:53:59.069 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they were the anchor, the boat,
the fish,

00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:03.115 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the olive branch, the star, and
oddly,

00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:06.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
these are the very symbols

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:09.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that the Flavian Caesars
used on their coins.

00:54:12.499 --> 00:54:14.585 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The final connecting
point between the Flavian

00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.796 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
family and Christianity is
that in the fourth century,

00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:20.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Flavius Constantine made
Christianity

00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:23.093 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the state religion of Rome.

00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:28.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The military achievements of
Caesar's

00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:30.809 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
were important to all Romans.

00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:34.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So certainly, the Flavian
Christians, the group

00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:38.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that the Roman Catholic
Church states were the first

00:54:38.192 --> 00:54:41.445 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
saints of the religion, would
have known

00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:45.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the identity of the son of
man that Jesus predicted

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.912 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
who would crush Galilee,
encircle Jerusalem with a wall,

00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:53.081 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and raze the temple was Titus
Flavius.

00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:59.338 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] So it seems
if a person knows how

00:54:59.338 --> 00:55:01.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to uncover them, there
are actually many clues

00:55:01.924 --> 00:55:05.761 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
pointing to the Flavian
origin of Christianity,

00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:08.764 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and perhaps the most intriguing
one that Joseph Atwill

00:55:08.764 --> 00:55:12.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
uncovered is a secret
code the Flavians used

00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:15.229 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in their documents,
which enabled him to make

00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:17.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
his startling discovery.

00:55:18.607 --> 00:55:20.734 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- So the Romans had the Jew's
scripture

00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:25.531 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
locked up inside their imperial
court and they studied it.

00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:28.867 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And what they discovered
was that there was a unique

00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
literary code hidden in the
text.

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:34.540 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] This hidden
code, which was common

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:38.585 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in Jewish scripture, was used
by the Flavian literary team

00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:42.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to place passages into
the gospels that had to be

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
deciphered to be understood.

00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:49.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This hidden literary technique
is known as typology.

00:55:56.186 --> 00:56:00.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- Typology is used throughout
the ancient Hebraic literature

00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:04.486 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it's a genre that is
really no longer understood

00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:09.408 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or used today, but simply
put, typology is using

00:56:11.785 --> 00:56:14.371 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
events from the past to provide

00:56:15.247 --> 00:56:17.999 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
form and context for subsequent
ones.

00:56:17.999 --> 00:56:21.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- What we're talking about
is stereotypic, stereotypic.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.257 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In other words, there's
an idolized prototype

00:56:25.257 --> 00:56:28.885 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
which shows certain
characteristics

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are performed in certain ways.

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- For instance, one of the
things they do

00:56:33.265 --> 00:56:37.436 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is they take an old story and
they retell it in a new form,

00:56:37.436 --> 00:56:40.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and they superimpose
contemporary history

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:46.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
upon old stories, and they
create these multi-layered text.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:51.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- In Hebraic typology, texts
were designed

00:56:52.701 --> 00:56:55.329 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to be read in comparison to one
another

00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:58.790 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
or inter-textually and in doing
so,

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.668 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a meaning that would not be
visible

00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:04.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the surface narration would
become

00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:07.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
apparent to someone who
understood the typologic

00:57:07.799 --> 00:57:10.385 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
connection between the stories.

00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:15.390 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Hebraic typology connects
prophets.

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.309 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Events from the life of one
prophet

00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:21.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
are placed into the life
of a subsequent prophet,

00:57:21.313 --> 00:57:24.149 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and this shows that
there is a divine pattern

00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:28.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
established by God, connecting
his prophets to one another.

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:30.197 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] The gospels
actually show how we can

00:57:30.197 --> 00:57:34.076 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
decipher for ourselves this
hidden code or typology

00:57:34.076 --> 00:57:37.371 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that was used to create the
Jesus story.

00:57:38.872 --> 00:57:41.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
(dramatic music)

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:47.005 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Joseph] At the very
beginning of the gospels,

00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:49.800 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there is a primer of this
typology.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What the author of Matthew has
done is

00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:55.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
take events from the Old
Testament

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:58.684 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and place them into the life of
Jesus.

00:57:58.684 --> 00:58:01.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
These events occur in the same
sequence

00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:06.066 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the story of Jesus as they
occur in the Old Testament.

- [Voiceover] Numerous
bible scholars had already

00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:10.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
identified the following
parallels.

00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:14.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Joseph] Both stories have
a patriarch named Joseph

00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:17.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
who goes from Israel to Egypt.

00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:23.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
A ruler who massacres innocent
boys.

00:58:26.044 --> 00:58:27.754 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A divine character who states
that,

00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:31.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
"All the men are dead
who sought your life."

00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:38.181 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And then a return from Egypt to
Israel.

00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:45.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is followed by events which
have passing through water.

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:46.606 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In the Old Testament, the
Israelites

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:48.692 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
pass through the Red Sea.

00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:53.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In Matthew, Jesus is given a
baptism

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in which he passes through
water.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:59.828 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We then travel into the
wilderness.

00:58:59.828 --> 00:59:03.081 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The Israelites are in the
wilderness for 40 years.

00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:06.668 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Jesus goes into the
wilderness for 40 days.

00:59:07.669 --> 00:59:10.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Finally, we have the three
temptations.

00:59:10.464 --> 00:59:13.633 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the Old Testament, we
have the temptation by bread,

00:59:13.633 --> 00:59:16.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the statement, "Do not tempt
God."

00:59:16.303 --> 00:59:19.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the commandment to worship
only God.

00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:21.767 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
These appear again in Matthew
where Jesus

00:59:21.767 --> 00:59:26.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is tempted by bread, tells
the Devil, "Do not tempt God."

00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:29.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And instructs him to worship
only God.

00:59:30.442 --> 00:59:33.195 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Therefore, when you
compare the life of Jesus

00:59:33.195 --> 00:59:36.198 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with the life of Moses, you see
a linkage

00:59:36.198 --> 00:59:39.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that shows that the
character in the gospels was

00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:44.247 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
divinely connected to the
character in the Old Testament.

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:47.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The life of the first
savior of Israel, Moses,

00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:50.754 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
foresaw the life of
Jesus, who's now claiming

00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:53.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to be the next savior of Israel.

00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:57.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] To understand
the rest of the Jesus story,

00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:01.139 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
his adult ministry, we simply
need to know that the same

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:05.227 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
system of parallel names,
locations, and concepts

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:09.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
occurring in the same sequence
was used

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to connect Jesus and the gospels
to

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:15.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Titus and the works of Josephus.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Our scholars explain this gospel
typology

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:20.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in the following three examples.

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:28.416 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- Jesus comes to the sea of
Gallilee

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.126 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
at the beginning of his
ministry.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.504 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
He gathers his disciples to him

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.090 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and he says, "Do not be afraid.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:40.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
"Follow me, and become fishers
of men."

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:44.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the gospel of Luke, Jesus
actually says catchers of men.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:49.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Titus comes to the same
location, to the sea of Galilee.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:52.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He gathers his troops,
his disciples together

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:54.067 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and he says, "Don't be afraid."

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.777 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And then he leads them.

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:59.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They follow him, and they
attack a group of Jewish rebels.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
They sink the Jews' boats.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:07.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The Jews attempt to swim
to safety and the Romans

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:10.876 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
use their spears to catch them.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.128 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
They become fishers of men.

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:17.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
- The match isn't exact,

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but we should never expect it to
be exact.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:24.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's simply a type
which is repeated across

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.600 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
the whole of the New Testament.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(foreboding music)

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.110 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Jesus is constantly dealing
with devils.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Josephus also deals with
devils, but Josephus

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:42.824 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
defines who these devils are.

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:45.744 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He states that the devils
are those individuals

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:49.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who have a rebellious spirit
and rebel against Rome.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.961 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
At Gadara, Jesus encounters
one man who has a legion

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
of demons inside his mind.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:59.841 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They, then, are driven out by
Jesus.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They infect a heard of swine and
this herd

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.639 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
rushes wildly into the water.

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:09.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This is a parallel to
Titus's battle at Gadara

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:13.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
where one individual
infects an entire legion

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:17.442 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of Jews with his demonic spirit
and then

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:20.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that group, in turn, infects
another group

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.364 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and this combined group

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:25.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is driven by the Romans into the
sea.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- What's being suggested
here is that this story

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.164 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that you find in the
gospels is, in some ways,

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
sort of like a grim parallel
about that military event.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's sort of like a bit
tongue and cheek, I think.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.966 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The Romans has a vicious
sense of humor like this,

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a very black sense of humor.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In a medieval text that I
studied,

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:49.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which is called the Gospel
of Barnabas, when you read

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.394 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that story, the way
it's presented is in an

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.104 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
unsophisticated form.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That is to say it's sort of been
decoded

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in some ways, and it becomes
clear

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:03.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what we're talking about
here are Jewish rebels

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:09.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
chased into the sea and
they drown into the sea.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:13.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In the gospels, these
are presented as pigs.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:16.584 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is a, once again, a very
dark,

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
black, sort of, Roman sense of
humor.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Some of this literature really

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.718 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
needs to be understood like
that.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.934 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- In Josephus's biography, he
describes

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.895 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
when he was in the
entourage of Titus during

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the closing stages of
the siege of Jerusalem,

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:42.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
he chanced upon three of
his friends who were being

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:45.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
crucified, and he pleaded with
Titus

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:49.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for their release, and
Titus gave that permission

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and the three figures were
removed from the cross.

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:56.124 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Two of them died, and one
revived.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:01.087 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now, if you're looking
for a stereotypic example

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:06.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of how some idea was floated
into the mind of someone

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:10.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
writing the gospels, that
is a pretty clear example.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's certainly a strange
occurrence that we find

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:16.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
such an incident that we
find in the work of Josephus

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:20.356 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
when it shows up in such a
dramatic form in the gospels.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:23.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Joseph] In the gospels,
Joseph of Arimathea asked

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:27.822 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Roman commander to take
Jesus down from the cross.

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:31.951 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In Josephus's history, Joseph
Bar Mathias

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
asked the Roman commander to

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
take someone down from the
cross.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:39.793 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Arimathea is a pun on Josephus's
last name, Bar Mathias.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.590 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- When you read our
sources really carefully,

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and you have to do it
really, really carefully

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because they didn't spell it out
for us.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:54.224 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It's effectively very
well-hidden.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have to understand that our
literature,

01:04:56.434 --> 01:05:00.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a lot of our literature
is essentially propaganda.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The Romans are not
writing objective history,

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:06.277 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and all of our literature has
been through Roman filters.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:08.738 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Perhaps that's the significance
of the Dead Sea scrolls

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.156 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that this literature that

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:13.201 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
hasn't been through the Roman
filters.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.829 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- It's important to
realize that Josephus wrote

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:19.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in an era when allegory
was regarded as a science.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Educated readers were expected
to be able

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:27.382 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to see another meaning in
religious texts

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:30.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
than the one that appeared
in the surface narration.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:31.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- We're dealing with Roman
literature on the one hand

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and Jewish literature on the
other,

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:36.558 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and it has to be said that in
both cases,

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:40.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
they're much more sophisticated,
much more multi-layered

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:44.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and allusive and much trickier

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:48.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
than modern readers suspect.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
No, it's not a very simple
literature.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:52.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's very, very complex
allegorical literature

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.993 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that indulges into the literary
games

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.578 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that the Romans played.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:58.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The more you understand
about Roman literature

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.749 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in this period and then
you place the gospels

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:05.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and other Christian literature
in that same mirror,

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you can start to see the games

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:10.717 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that are being played in that
literature.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:14.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- Now these parallels have
been seen by other scholars,

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:17.473 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but what they failed to
notice is that they occur

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:20.185 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in the same sequence, and
thereby,

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:22.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
they create a typologic pattern.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- The Flavian thesis, it's
trying to read these texts

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:28.693 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in context because in any given
text,

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:31.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you've got the text in the first
instance,

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and then you've got the
context, the environment

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:37.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in which it happens, and of
course, in all of these texts,

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:38.953 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
also, you've got a subtext.

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:41.706 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So you've got text, context and
subtext,

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:44.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and you have to be able to
read all of those things

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:47.420 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and unfortunately, many
religious people

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
who are coming out of
seminaries, who are coming out

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of religious colleges, they're
just not

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.011 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
being trained in this
sort of level of reading.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They're, instead, just
being trained to just read

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
on one level, which is a literal
level,

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and I think that that's very
unfortunate

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:05.063 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and that really needs to be
challenged.

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.817 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] By studying
the multiple layers

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:13.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in these ancient texts in
the original Greek language,

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:17.075 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Joseph Atwill was able to
discover not just a handfu0l,

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:20.453 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but over 40 typological
parallels between

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:22.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the gospels and the works of
Josephus,

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which show that the ministry
of Jesus Christ followed

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:30.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
an exact sequence the military
campaign of Titus Flavius

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:34.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
through parallel names,
locations, and concepts.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- Once I understood the
system that the Flavians

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:41.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
were using to link Jesus and
Titus,

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.894 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I was able to discover
dozens of these parallels

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:48.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
between Jesus and Titus,
and what was amazing

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:51.234 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is that they occurred
in the same sequence.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:54.487 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And this simply proves
that this was deliberate,

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:58.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that these unusual
parallels had been created

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:00.576 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
by the Flavians as a signature.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:04.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It is their way of telling
posterity that

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
they authored the gospels.

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:10.295 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
These parallels are the Flavian
signature of the gospels.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(triumphant music)

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Both Jesus and Titus began their

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.564 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
campaigns at the Sea of Galilee

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:32.400 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and then go into the Galilean
countryside

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
followed by a journey to
Jerusalem.

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Once they reach the city's
outskirts,

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:40.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they pause for a period before
they enter.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Finally, they leave the city

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where their campaigns come to an
end.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
To catalog the many
parallels, I gave each one

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:53.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
a convenient name that
related to the concept

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in that particular parallel set.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:59.052 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Starting at Galilee, each
of these are episodes

01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:01.763 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that occurred both in the
gospel stories of Jesus

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:05.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and in the history of
Titus's military campaign.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
(upbeat music)

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:17.195 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Both Jesus and Titus
journeyed to Jerusalem,

01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:19.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
each sending messengers ahead to
meet him

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:22.075 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
when he gets to the city.

01:09:28.039 --> 01:09:29.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
When the Romans get to
Jerusalem,

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.751 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they notice that the Jewish
factions are fighting

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:33.294 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
against themselves.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.296 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
At this point in the gospels,

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:38.716 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Jesus talks about a house
divided

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:41.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
against itself cannot stand.

01:09:43.137 --> 01:09:46.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Then Josephus wrote that
in preparation for battle,

01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:49.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Titus ordered all of the fruit
trees

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:50.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
between the Roman camp

01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:53.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and the walls of Jerusalem cut
down.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:57.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
At this point in the
gospels, Jesus states that

01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:01.322 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
if a fruit tree does not
bear fruit tree, cut it down.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Titus goes around the walls of
Jerusalem

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:13.376 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
looking for the best
place to construct a tower

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:16.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from which they can launch their
attack.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.841 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
At this point in the gospels,
Jesus asks,

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:23.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"Which one of you who is
going to build a tower

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:27.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
"doesn't first sit down
and think about the cost?"

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.937 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
At this point in the
history, Titus sends Josephus

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:37.400 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to ask the Jews what terms
they will accept for peace.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In the gospels, Jesus
describes a king who sends

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:44.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a delegation to ask for terms of
peace.

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:51.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Both Jesus and Titus at
this point have triumphant

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:55.126 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
entrances into Jerusalem,
during which amazingly,

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:58.296 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
stones are said to cry out.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.222 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Each, then, drives a den of
thieves

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:11.058 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
out from the area from
in front of the temple.

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:14.020 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This is followed by Titus
encircling Jerusalem

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with a wall, and Jesus
predicting that

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:20.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Jerusalem will be encircled with
a wall.

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:27.033 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Because of the walls,
starvation sets into Jerusalem.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.619 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Josephus wrote that a woman
named Mary

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.705 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
who called her son a myth for
the world

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:36.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
slayed him, ate him,
thereby turning him into

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
a human Passover lamb.

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:43.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In the gospels, we now
have the Last Supper.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Jesus tells his disciples,
"Take, eat.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.804 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
"This is my body.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.389 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
"This is my blood."

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:54.560 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Therefore, turning him
into a human Passover lamb.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:59.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Here, then, is the
Flavian signature of their

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
authorship of the gospels.

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:04.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- You can see the fingerprints
that

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.532 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they've left their fingerprints
all over these texts.

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:11.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You can start to, as it
were, decode these texts

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:15.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and start to arrive at some
really startling conclusions

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:19.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
about how early Christianity
first arose.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.423 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Voiceover] Our scholars have
shown

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:27.301 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that the gospels were not the
product of primitive Jewish

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:30.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
fisherman, rather they are a
sophisticated literary work

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:33.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
combining religious ideas of the
day

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:37.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with Roman political
perspective and power.

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:39.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Joseph Atwill's research reveals
that

01:12:39.647 --> 01:12:42.108 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
reading the works of Josephus
concurrently

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with the New Testament
shows that the events

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of Jesus's life were not
historical,

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but rather all of them are
dependent

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:53.869 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on the events of the military
campaign of Titus Flavius.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:57.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Jesus Christ was an allegory
for the Roman Caesar Titus,

01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:01.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the Messiah of the Roman
Empire, the Roman son

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:05.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of a god that Christianity
was set up to worship.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.803 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- I certainly don't want to
undermine

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the positive things in
Christianity.

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:15.891 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I'm happy to admit that
there are positive things

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:19.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in Christianity and in
other religions as well.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
What's an issue here are the

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
historical claims of these
religions.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Voiceover] Traditionally,
religious dogma

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:29.822 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has forbidden the examination
of historical discoveries

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:33.451 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
or the inclusion of
certain scientific findings

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:36.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in their teachings, asking
their followers instead

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.165 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
to blindly believe as they say,

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:42.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not as the objective facts may
show.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- Even if a time, perhaps it's a
new

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
intellectual renaissance which
is

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.009 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
getting fed up with many of the
structures

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.511 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that we live with, which is
recognizing

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:55.306 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
major frauds at the
hearts of our financial

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.391 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
market and the heart of our
industry

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.810 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the plug is being pulled on
them.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:03.564 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And my view is that we
have yet another fraud,

01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:05.733 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the biggest of them
all, and it's the fraud

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.069 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of the heart of Christianity.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:12.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And it is a time for the
whistleblowers to come out

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:15.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and to make this information
available

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
not just to scholars in academic
journals,

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.455 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
but to have it widely available

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.874 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to anybody who wants to know.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.584 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Voiceover] It's helpful to
hear

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:26.170 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a wide diversity of
voices in order for people

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to arrive at their own
conclusions,

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:31.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the theories brought
forth by our scholars

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.678 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
are a part of that diversity.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.389 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- When they hear that the
Jesus story is a myth,

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:38.140 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
people feel like you're
taking something away,

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
but you're really not.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:42.478 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You push people and you
go, "Why do you believe

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:43.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
"in the historical Jesus?"

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.397 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Often people will go,

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.190 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
"Well, you know, the Bible or
something."

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.692 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But when you go, "Well,
have you studied it

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
"as a historical document?

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:50.277 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"Have you looked at the
evidence?"

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:51.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They'll go, "Well, no, I
haven't."

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So that's not the real reason.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The real reason, when you push
people is,

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:59.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"Well, I have a relationship
with Jesus.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"I have a personal
relationship with Jesus,

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:03.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
"and that's what I don't want to
lose."

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:06.043 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And that's a really good reason
a Gnostic,

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:09.380 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and really bad reason
to be a Literatalist.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Voiceover] The Gnostics, as
well as

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.925 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
pre-Christian pagan mystery
schools

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
believed that the myth of
the dying and resurrecting

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
god man was an allegory to
be used for personal growth,

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:22.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to die to their lower nature

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.770 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and arise to their higher
nature.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Literalists took control
of the original myths

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:30.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and shaped it so it would take
the power

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
away from the individual

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:34.905 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and place it into a central
authority.

01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:37.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Rediscovering the original
myths gives people

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:41.746 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the freedom to choose the
beliefs that truly served them.

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- Okay, some Christians have
developed

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:49.754 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
their personal faith to the
extent that

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:53.924 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that Christ is this energy or
force of power within them.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:58.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is how they have
interpreted the story now.

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:01.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The story has become, again,

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.144 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
what it actually began as, an
allegory.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.980 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I have no issue with the Christ
within.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.400 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I have an issue with the church
militant.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:17.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What threatens humanity
is organized, regimentized

01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:22.119 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
religion on the march, taken so
seriously

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:25.456 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that you will act out its worst
presets.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Voiceover] If we
examine all the religions

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:35.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the world, we find that
there is a common threat

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that connects all faiths and all
people,

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:41.514 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it is from this
connection that we can make

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:45.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the choices that have now become
so critical to our future.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:51.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- I like to focus on the
origins of religious ideas

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.527 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and it turns out that they're
very unifying underneath

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:58.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
all of the divisiveness
that we see on the surface

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:01.492 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that would be extremely
helpful for all of humanity

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:05.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to realize that there
is this underlying unity

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:09.166 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and those origins are
basically nature worship:

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:13.712 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the study of the sun, the
moon, the stars, the planets.

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:17.550 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This is all what humanity
has been looking at,

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.220 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of course, with great awe and
reverence

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
for thousands of years and
it's extremely important,

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.517 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I think, for us, to get
back to those roots.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.853 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The destruction of the
planet is also directly

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
tied to religious ideas.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This can help to restore
balance to the planet,

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.861 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in this very, very
profoundly significant way.

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:39.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- [Voiceover] The very
survival of humanity

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:42.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
depends on the viewing
history from a new perspective

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:45.744 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so that we can be clearer
on the historical facts

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:49.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and still honor the myths that
offer us the greatest wisdom.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- It's what the myth, what the
poetry says

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:57.590 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that matters, not what actually
happened.

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So each new generation, whatever
you say,

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:03.512 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is going to hear the myth and
that's what is true for them.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:07.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And what follows is the
actual history and it's much

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:10.102 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
too complex for the average
person to ever

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
put their head around.

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:14.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Voiceover] Though the
actual history is complex,

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and we may never know
all of the facts about

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what happened 2,000 years ago,

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.573 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the voices of our
scholars are contributing

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:25.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to an ever-widening
dialogue and the growing

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
paradigm shift being
witnessed all around the world

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:31.832 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
today that can lead to a more
empowered

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:34.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and enlightened humanity
tomorrow.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- This is really
important for our culture,

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:42.343 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to understand where
Christianity came from,

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:44.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and this is direct evidence.

01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:48.641 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You can actually walk this path
and come to this conclusion.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:50.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You can know that Christianity

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.561 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
was an invention of the Romans.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:56.398 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was done to pacify their
subjects,

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and this is important because it
gives us

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.611 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
a different way of
understanding government,

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:03.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
how government operates, the
tools that government uses,

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.783 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the purpose that government has
for the

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:08.202 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
various propaganda apparatus.

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:11.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Evangelical Christians are
getting away

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:14.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
with debunking facts as mere
theories.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.126 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Even subjects like evolution,

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.712 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but they provide no
evidence for their position

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:21.507 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
other than to simply cite
religious dogma,

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:24.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and if you look at the
influence that dogma

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.095 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
is having in the media today,

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:29.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you can easily see it is
increasing.

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:31.141 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I would like to challenge these
extremists

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:35.312 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to consider the possibility
that my findings are correct.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:39.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Though their is much good in
Christianity,

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:43.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
we have to understand how rulers
have used it to control us,

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:49.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and how they are still using
it to control us today.

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:51.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I hope citizens will be more
skeptical

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:53.664 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
when they hear an authority
figure

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:57.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
using faith to interpret laws or
a belief

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:01.338 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in Armageddon to create
governmental policies.

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.675 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Flavians encoded a secret
message into the gospels,

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:07.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which we can now
understand in a new light.

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:12.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
"You shall know the truth and
the truth shall set you free."

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:18.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(triumphant music)

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
(upbeat music)
