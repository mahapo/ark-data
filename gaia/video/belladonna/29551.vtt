So what I'd like to do
in this first session

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
is to get to know you
both a bit better,

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
but also to provide an
open forum for discussion

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.454 align:middle line:90%
without judgment.

00:33:34.454 --> 00:33:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I find that,
especially these days,

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%

marriage without really

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.726 align:middle line:90%
understanding what it means.

00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask
you some questions,

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.610 align:middle line:84%
but if there's anything you
ant to raise-- concerns,

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:90%
feelings-- please, feel free.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.881 align:middle line:84%

Please, go on, yeah.

00:34:10.857 --> 00:34:15.489 align:middle line:84%

to four months, if possible,

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:90%
on a Sunday afternoon.

a large-- a large gathering.

No, not really.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:84%
On my side, there's my mum,
my dad died not long ago.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

step parents live in Denmark

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:90%

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.391 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: We're going to
see them after the wedding.

00:34:40.391 --> 00:34:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, since we've covered
so much ground so quickly,

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I-- I think I can, um,
cut to the chase here.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:84%
What do you-- what
do both of you

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:56.269 align:middle line:90%
hope to learn from this union?

00:34:56.269 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Either about each other
or about yourself or--

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.477 align:middle line:84%
KATHERINE: Do you
want some water?

00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:02.176 align:middle line:90%
LUKE: Yeah.

00:35:02.176 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Luke, would you
like to go first?

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:18.000 align:middle line:84%
LUKE: Well-- OK, well, I
guess, um, I want to, you know,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.945 align:middle line:84%
learn how to support each other,
emotionally and spiritually.

00:35:22.945 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to--
know when-- when to

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
hold your ground and,
you know, when not to.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Fall into each other.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.016 align:middle line:90%


00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to, uh-- what's

-Can you do this, Hugh?
-No.

No, no, I have my

to wink, I'll-- I'll go.

Yeah, sure.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Amelia, no, as your

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.645 align:middle line:84%
recommend that you don't
consider that as an option.

01:10:20.645 --> 01:10:23.884 align:middle line:90%

What?

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:49.937 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
say they can't

01:11:49.937 --> 01:11:53.913 align:middle line:90%
believe it's happening to them?

01:11:53.913 --> 01:12:00.235 align:middle line:84%

this is happening to me.

01:12:00.235 --> 01:12:04.060 align:middle line:90%

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Something.

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the gap.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.285 align:middle line:90%
The gap?

01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Reinvention gap.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:21.315 align:middle line:84%
Um, it's sort of, well, it's
still there, but in a way

01:12:21.315 --> 01:12:28.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a time where you
can change, make choices

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:42.032 align:middle line:84%
to-- you can change yourself or,
um, do anything, meet someone.

01:12:42.032 --> 01:12:44.893 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want
to reinvent yourself?

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:48.362 align:middle line:84%
Uh, because--
because I want to be

01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
the person I know I am inside.

01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%


01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.690 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think
you know what you feel

01:12:56.690 --> 01:12:59.110 align:middle line:90%
inside isn't how you appear?

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:09.521 align:middle line:84%
Oh, because, uh, sometimes I
don't know what to say in front

01:13:09.521 --> 01:13:13.609 align:middle line:84%
of people and the
lines shrivel up

01:13:13.609 --> 01:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and it always happens
in the most critical

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.110 align:middle line:90%
situations possible, you know?

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I get home and sort
of slap myself for not saying

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.396 align:middle line:84%
anything or sticking
up for myself,

01:13:24.396 --> 01:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
or-- yeah, well,
it's just pathetic.

01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, I think we all do that one.
-Really?

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.601 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:35.601 --> 01:13:38.898 align:middle line:90%
I don't melt. I, um, I freeze.

01:13:38.898 --> 01:13:42.195 align:middle line:90%
Oh, all right.

01:13:42.195 --> 01:13:45.346 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you were doing
the other day when I met you?

01:13:45.346 --> 01:13:47.816 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:47.816 --> 01:13:48.645 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, no.

01:13:48.645 --> 01:13:51.406 align:middle line:84%
That was, um, that
was straight theater.

01:13:51.406 --> 01:13:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the practice isn't
going so well, so, you know,

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.355 align:middle line:84%
Hugh and I have to
do concerts at lunch.

01:13:58.355 --> 01:14:00.624 align:middle line:90%
Bring in a bit extra cash.

01:14:00.624 --> 01:14:03.029 align:middle line:90%
AMELIA: Really?

01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:06.436 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it weird how we have this
idea that we're-- we're going

01:14:06.436 --> 01:14:08.915 align:middle line:90%
to get life right?
