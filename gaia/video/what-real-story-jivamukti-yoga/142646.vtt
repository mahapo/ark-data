00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:10%
Not so long ago, I began to
ask myself this question.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in South Africa, a
land with a violent history,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:10%
filled with angry,
loving, confused,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:10%
and proud people dealing
with an uncertain future.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, this all
changed as Nelson Mandela

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.975 align:middle line:84%
became our first democratically
elected president, freeing

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
our land and its people.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
In the same year that our great
land obtained its freedom,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
my own world was
turned upside down.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Both my grandfather and
father had made the decision

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
to end their own lives within
a few months of one another.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
This loss and pain was
the catalyst that led me

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:90%
down a road of self-discovery.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The more I ask the
question what is real,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
the less I seem to know.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
real story begins.

Living oceans apart
from New York,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined that
our destines would

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:90%
be so inextricably linked.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But destiny, it seems,
knows no boundaries.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
At about the same time in which
my country and countless others

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
around the world were
experiencing the joys and fears

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of transformation, two
visionaries, Sharon Gannon

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and David Life, were beginning
to inspire a world of change

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:84%
in a quaint, artistic
haven in the East Village

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
on the corner of Avenue
B and East 10 Street

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:90%

time.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really glad
that I got to be

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:10%
front and center in
an environment that

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:10%
was so diverse.

better ways of living,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:10%

the Life Cafe about 1980.

He said, well, do you want
to come out to New York?

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to open
an art gallery.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%

would open a store that had

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
collectible furniture and
collectible items like Life

magazines.

in there during the day.

We would just have
the doors wide open.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And so people that lived in
the neighborhood would walk by.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd come in and
say, what are you doing?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And David would
say, you know, this

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
is the plan-- we're going
to make an art gallery here.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%

we don't really
need an art gallery.

>> Actually, that's what
I wanted in New York City.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:10%
I was enamoured of the idea of
the bohemian New York coffee

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:10%
shop scene, and
poetry, and jazz.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened at Life Cafe.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
All I really did was give
it a place to happen.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%

jazz, and poetry, and art,

and a wonderful
community of friends.

Cafe as a waitress in 1985.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
He was in his 30's

But to me, he just seemed like
this responsible older man.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, he was an
incredible businessman

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:90%
and visionary.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And in other ways,
he was horrible

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
because there was no one
who came into that cafe

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
who, if they needed
a free cup of coffee

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
or a free meal that day,
that wouldn't give it

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
to them without any
question or hesitation.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:90%

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.741 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of fun
waitressing at the Life Cafe.

00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
There were all these Vietnam
vets that would hang out there.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:90%
They'd be smoking pot.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, come on,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%

in the neighborhood.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
The people that own art

coming in who couldn't
afford to pay for anything.

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
They were certainly not
going to leave you a tip.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were camping
out there all day

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%

chess, cards, whatever.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.751 align:middle line:84%

Sharon started working there.

We started hanging out
together because we

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:90%
were working together.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
You could kind of see
a bit of a chemistry

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:90%
between her and David.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%
And she was carrying a violin.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>> She was beautiful, and
fierce, and tough, and direct.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Anything that Sharon did,
I was pretty in awe of.

working there together.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
David was, you know,
supervising, managing.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the jazz
musicians was selling a cape.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Sharon, you could see she
loved that cape by her eyes.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
David got her the
cape from the guy, who

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%
bought the cape from the guy.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
The little family of like--
people that always hung out

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:84%
there were all smiling, you
know, at their love kind

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.742 align:middle line:90%
of blossoming.

00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:84%

into a room together,

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
you could feel the
relationship that they had.

I can only know this
now, after knowing them

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
for all of these years,
their karma was inevitable.

devoted to the idea that art

should uplift and exalt the
heart, the mind, and the soul.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
I was an artist.

I used everything and anything--
painting and writing, dancing.

I wasn't very good at
any of those things,

great delight and joy.

think, aerobics at Crunch Gym.

the first people

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.167 align:middle line:84%
actually teaching aerobics
and making a living out of it.

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course she was
waitressing at the cafe,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's how she
was making her living.

teaching aerobics,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.840 align:middle line:90%

I'm sore.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And then she goes to
me, well, what's that?

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, that's
a Pigeon Pose.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I was showing her the poses.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%

going to start a new class,

take my class at the
University of the Streets.

Sharon and David became my

let's bring Tara here.

I had done a lot of PR work.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had that room
packed with people.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:90%

My bosses said, Sharon, we
can't disappoint these people.

You're going to have to go
in there and teach the class.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:90%
I have no skills.

my cassette tapes

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that I used when I taught
my aerobics classes.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%

affection, love,

00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll quote Sri Bhagavan Das.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
"Yoga is not to get
out of this world.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:90%
It's to get into it."

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I suppose becoming
more real is taking more

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.322 align:middle line:84%
responsibility,
having more self-love,

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and so that you
then love others--

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:90%
having more self-respect.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%

your true desire rather than

were the people who came--

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:90%
had come to the performances.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
We started to teach
yoga as a way to share.

>> You know, it's a
fascinating history.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:10%
If you look at how
yoga came out of India

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:10%
and penetrated Western
culture, yoga teachers

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:10%
taught what they thought
American public could learn,

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:10%
which was the
physical side of yoga.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:10%
There wasn't a lot
of dharma talk.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a
lot of philosophy,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:90%
a lot of study of texts.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
We're a half century on now.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And there is a growing
community within the yoga world

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:84%
who want to know what's
the background, where

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:90%
is this taking me.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
People come to a yoga class
and, if it's taught well,

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
they sense something
intuitively.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on here.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.109 align:middle line:84%
This is more than just an
alternative to pilates.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:84%
There's something
happening to me.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
And they don't quite
know what it is.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's a growing interest
in the background to yoga.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:90%
What was yoga intended to do?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
What's the structure, the
philosophical structure

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:90%
underneath yoga?

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That's where we now see a
greater presence of Bhakti,

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:90%
or devotion.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:10%
gt;gt; Bhakti promotes in
you the thing that is most

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:10%
important, which is the
joy of your own soul.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:10%
And so people go
out and they try

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:10%

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, they were seekers.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:90%
It showed in their art.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.342 align:middle line:84%

me when they went to India.

to our first teacher training

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
offered by Sivananda
Organization,

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:84%
we came back and opened
the Jivamukti Yoga Society

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:84%
on Avenue B, just a block from
our apartment and a block from

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Life Cafe, so very convenient.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:29.148 align:middle line:84%
And we taught just once or
twice a week in that space.

shifted in David that made me

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
pay attention and get curious
about what just happened.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
He went away one way and came
back not completely different,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:90%
but there was something--

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:84%
an ease, a presence, a
deeper level of honesty,

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:90%
a deeper level of generosity.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:90%
David seemed happier.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
He seemed healthier.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
He seemed more grounded.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.562 align:middle line:84%
Sharon seemed even more
committed to this practice

00:19:17.562 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:90%
than I'd ever seen her.

At this point now, she's
now teaching yoga at Crunch

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%

little bit of a following.

Sharon was the main teacher.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'd only gone
to India on the premise

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that I would never
be a yoga teacher.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
She did the same thing to
me that Tara did to her.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
She just decided to be sick one
day and I had to sub for her.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I suggested I take
some photographs of them.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:10%
I showed them some
pictures I'd taken.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:10%
And all the previous
photographs I'd seen of them

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:10%
had been kind of
quirky, shall we say--

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:10%
East Villagey--
when I was taking

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:10%
more kind of very
simple, classic pictures.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, before we did this,
there were no yoga calendars.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And now they're everywhere
and they seem ubiquitous.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.619 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, it was
like, oh, a yoga calendar?

00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:84%
You never know where these
things end up, do you?

That's the whole thing--

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and who they inspire.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
They were very inspiring.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
They made you want
to practice yoga

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and they pushed your
buttons at the same time,

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't really feel
from the other places.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had a revelation of one
day when, after a few classes--

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:84%
although it was really
painful, it hurt like hell--

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I needed to do it for
the rest of my life,

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:84%
because I had that kind
of momentary revelation.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the first
time we tried this.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And we got much better at it,
so that we were just flat.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I should've crossed
my legs the other way.

00:21:04.956 --> 00:21:05.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:05.755 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we would
have been balanced.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But I remember it was
good fun when we did it

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.222 align:middle line:90%
because Barbara and I had to--

00:21:11.222 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I had to come out from
behind the camera.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:90%
And we had to lift Sharon up--

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
like, Sharon was in a
rigid, locked position,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
fortunately-- and place
her on top of David,

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and then run away and
hope she didn't fall off

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.865 align:middle line:90%

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could open a

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't find one

they think that they can

teachings of yoga
through chanting.

00:21:52.351 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
everybody was saying,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
there's just no way
that's going to happen,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%

that smelled like cat piss.

And I walked in.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
There's this beautiful

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%

Yeah, I didn't know
what was going on.

any clothes, the

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And it was a photographer
named George Lange who

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:10%
suggested that I go there and
find Sharon Gannon, because she

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:10%
would be a great yoga teacher.

There's so many cute girls.

00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got there, there
was not a guy there.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Back then, there was
maybe a gay guy or two,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:90%
but it's, like, 60 girls.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%

It wasn't about the body.

00:23:05.495 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
It was about the mind,
the body, and the spirit,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
and who you were as a person.

00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:10%
So Jivamukti was, to me,
the first yoga brand.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:10%
It created a whole
world onto its own.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, everybody tries to do that.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Not many people can.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:10%

very important in opening up

the West to the Indian
philosophies and practices.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a big surfboard
riding that wave, you know?

If you step back a level,
you see the whole wave.

way after the creation
of Jivamukti yoga.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:90%
It was about 2008.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I had everything I needed,
but I knew deep down

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:90%
inside something was missing.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Every year of my father's
anniversary of his passing,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I would withdraw into
a serious depression.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
The older I got,
the more paranoid

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I got, fearing that
suicide was inevitable.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then something really
interesting happened.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.935 align:middle line:84%
Mich, my fiancee,
started practicing

00:24:33.935 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Jivamukti yoga and living
yoga in Johannesburg.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I was curious, and so I began
meditating and practicing

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:90%
with her.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The ancient teachings of yoga
philosophy resonated with me.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Mich and I headed to Costa Rica
in search of Jivamukti yoga.

really grabbed me

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
until I stepped into Jivamukti
in 1994 on Second Avenue.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:90%

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to believe
that that perception from the I

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of everything I see is
identifying what is reality,

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
we start to get a false

And we can't help that.

is completely shared.

And what is real is when we
lose that sense of self that's

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:84%

in this place where only that's

>> A good friend of mine who
I was working with took me

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:10%
to Jivamukti primarily because
I was too young to be too tired

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:10%
and really lacking time for
myself, but also for my family.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:84%

that I realized that my work was

taking priority over my
health, my well-being,

said, come to Jivamukti.

Sometimes, 15, 20 minutes
into class, I look up

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and I see a wave of
people moving together,

breathing together.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.870 align:middle line:84%

what is real, maybe

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that's their answer,
is they can feel

that there is that
harmony and that synergy.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%

I didn't really know that
much about yoga philosophy.

And then I read
about the kleshas,

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and a light bulb
went off in my head

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.550 align:middle line:84%
because there it
was, fear of death.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.490 align:middle line:84%

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We call him Guruji.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The moment I met him, I
was completely changed.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I was, from then on,
very deeply interested

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in the subject of
yoga, and particularly

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.490 align:middle line:90%
in studying with him.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Sharon and David
felt that presence

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:84%
when they were with
him, and he adored them.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
will do great things.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Great things.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
held the space for a moment.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.902 align:middle line:90%
And so they have.

Guruji, Shri K. Pattabhi Jois,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.070 align:middle line:84%
they were such a relief,
a feeling of relief,

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.520 align:middle line:84%
a feeling that we were
on the right track.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.265 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.265 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Immediately, like, when they
were there, he would be like,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:90%
you come upstairs.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:84%
No one was ever
invited upstairs.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got invited
upstairs, and I had

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:90%
been a student for eight years.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
He knew immediately
what kind of impact

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:90%
they would have worldwide.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And so he wanted to
give them everything.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] your
chin-- chin there.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:90%
This one again.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Because to be a good Ashtanga
teacher, in the classroom,

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:90%
you can't be playing music.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
You can't be talking
about animal rights.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And it probably would have
been a lot easier for us

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:84%
if we just became
Ashtanga teachers.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But we had this calling,
or this destiny,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:84%
or this commitment that
we had already made,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.970 align:middle line:90%
and we stuck with it.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:90%
And he was OK with that.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And so each guru brought in
many aspects to what has become

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Jivamukti yoga.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.130 align:middle line:90%
And there's overlap.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all of them
know all the methods.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what made
them great teachers.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But they were special
in particular areas

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.780 align:middle line:84%
where they really
impacted on us.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.488 align:middle line:84%
And those things came together
to become Jivamukti yoga.

walked out and I was floating.

And I've just had this
amazing experience--

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.430 align:middle line:90%
hands-on assists.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:90%
There was Sanskrit chanting.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.352 align:middle line:84%
There was these poses that
I had never done before.

00:38:44.352 --> 00:38:46.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Usually, people come to yoga
because they're not feeling

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:10%
good, because
something's wrong--

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:52.030 align:middle line:10%
because either they
need to learn to relax,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.990 align:middle line:10%
or they have pain in their
body, or they have mental pain,

It is very rarely the happiness.

>> And the thing that really
stood out for me was Sharon

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:10%
and David were
revolutionary activists,

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.820 align:middle line:10%
not just in the classroom
teaching their yoga Asanas,

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:10%

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:10%

things that I was interested

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:10%
in, in one place--

yoga philosophy,
and the movement,

even though I wasn't very
much into moving in general.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But I loved it from
the first second I

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:90%
stepped into the class.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:10%

We have to talk.

We have to choreograph.

We have to make
people feel welcomed.

at the Jivamukti school.

And the teacher was--

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.550 align:middle line:90%
what is the expression?

All over the place.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%

speak to this teacher

and try to help them.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting at my desk
and I was, oh, like this.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was like, what can I
provide as far as guidance, you

know?

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And I saw on the

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding you.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I saw Ahimsa, Bhakti,
Dhyana, Nada, Shastra.

to give her a hand, right?

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Help her.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And that was my hand.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.040 align:middle line:84%

It's everywhere.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why for me personally,
music is the most powerful way

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to share the
teachings, because you

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
can take a tremendous
amount of information,

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:84%
collapse and condense
it into, like,

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:84%
a three or four-minute
song, and share it.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.120 align:middle line:90%

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Early on, when I went one
of Sharon and David's class,

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:84%
they had songs by Bob Dylan,
the Beastie Boys, you know,

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:90%
spoken-word pieces.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So for me as a hip-hop artist,
that really opened my mind to,

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:51.090 align:middle line:84%
like, yoga's not just
about sitting quietly

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:84%
in your lotus
posture, meditating.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.855 align:middle line:84%

David really understood

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.060 align:middle line:84%
the technology of music and
sound in the yoga practice,

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.075 align:middle line:84%
because when you're moving and
breathing, you're on your mat,

00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:84%
you are more present and
aware about everything.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can listen
to a song from that place,

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.920 align:middle line:84%
the impact of the song
is so much greater.

Well, I think it is a common
essence of the human DNA,

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.440 align:middle line:84%
the desire to be personally,
fully, emotionally connected

the names of that place

deepest place, the atman.

that we're all a part of.

And so the repetition
of the names of that one

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.610 align:middle line:84%

us in that direction,

the original source of

>> But the whole reason that
there's this huge pantheon

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:26.000 align:middle line:84%
within India of so many deities
is because you can choose.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe today you need
help being patient.

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe tomorrow you'll
need help being generous.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
different god or goddess

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:38.540 align:middle line:84%
for each of these
aspects, but it's really

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.010 align:middle line:90%
manifestation of the one.

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So you choose what
you want, but you're

>> You can say why
these names work,

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:51.320 align:middle line:84%
is because these are the
names of beings that have

accomplished what we want
to accomplish for ourselves,

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:57.260 align:middle line:84%
which is to become
happy, to become free,

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and to know reality.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.770 align:middle line:84%
If we tune ourselves to their
presence, we receive these,

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:07.020 align:middle line:84%
you could say, the blessings
of their energy or their being.

the material realm, to

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
Kirtan is unique,

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:20.510 align:middle line:90%
because you are using words.

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You're using mantras or
names to express something

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:26.110 align:middle line:90%
that is really ineffable.

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It is unfathomable.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And so somehow in
song, we can praise

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:38.390 align:middle line:84%
what is beyond the perception
of material senses.

It can even be a
geographical space within me

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.600 align:middle line:10%
that is being
activated when I chant.

>> In Sanskrit, the word
for love is "prema."

00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:53.417 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually were just
to chant that long enough,

00:58:53.417 --> 00:58:55.250 align:middle line:84%
you're actually going
to start to feel love.

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So as you chant, all of
this negativity around you

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:00.290 align:middle line:90%
just starts to dissolve.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And Sanskrit makes the
experience of the self much

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.950 align:middle line:84%
more accessible so that you
start to get this Vinyasa,

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:08.600 align:middle line:90%
or what we call "the flow."

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And you start to link sounds.

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.350 align:middle line:84%
The more you are
linking things, the more

it starts to create more space,
and more time, and more peace,

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and more grace, and more ease.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it just
realigns everything.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big board meeting

What does bending forward
have to do with that?

What does twisting

Now, as you inhale, you're
going to shift forward

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.964 align:middle line:90%
so your feet are pointed.

01:02:27.964 --> 01:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to just lift up--

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.920 align:middle line:90%
levitate your head, your leg up.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Specific Asanas have to
do with specific chakras.

01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And specific chakras
have to do with

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
specific karmic relationships
that we have with others.

that Asana practice can actually
lead you directly to yoga,

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:58.120 align:middle line:90%
to enlightenment.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.560 align:middle line:90%
How?

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
By assisting you in resolving
the karmic relationships

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
that you have with
others, which are really

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:11.913 align:middle line:84%
creating the obstacles

you just feel it.

for something like this,

like some deeper
meaning to life.

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.580 align:middle line:90%

oh, you know, it's so terrible.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I have to practice nonviolence,
and I have to always be kind,

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and I have to always
think about others first.

And at the end of the day,
we only have ourselves.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I find that doing my practice
and then going into meditation

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.540 align:middle line:90%

And that's why you go
deeper and deeper into it,

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
because you just want to be able
to feel like that all the time.

Chant, and you meditate, and
you do the Asana practice

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.930 align:middle line:90%

enlightenment, compassion

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we tone it
down a little bit?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, make it maybe a
little bit more accessible.

why not?

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And chapter three, Jules Febre.

>> David wanted to teach yoga
to kids, so he borrowed Jules.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the very first yoga
classes that I taught Jules is

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.820 align:middle line:90%
when he was four years old.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> At some point,
Jules said to me,

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:26.055 align:middle line:84%
do you think Uncle David would
take me with him to India?

01:06:26.055 --> 01:06:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>> So I took him to India.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And we took yoga
classes in Mysore

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:33.540 align:middle line:90%
at 4:00 AM in the morning.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
When he came back, he
said, OK, he did yoga.

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.050 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Finished.

01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> He was done with yoga.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want
anything to do with it.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.330 align:middle line:10%
>> When I came to know him,
he wasn't doing anything.

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:49.450 align:middle line:10%
So he was just hanging out,
getting into a little trouble.

01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> He just fell in with some
kids that took it to the next

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.280 align:middle line:90%
level.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers, they don't
realize the seriousness

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%
of their actions sometimes.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.230 align:middle line:10%
So he got arrested.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:02.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I was sitting
in a prison cell,

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:05.470 align:middle line:10%

we do a lot at Jivamukti--

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.690 align:middle line:10%
make me an instrument.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't doing
it consciously.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, and now
I will do my mantra.

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%

early introductions started

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.700 align:middle line:90%
to kick in.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And he became the yogi
he is and the great yoga

teacher that he is.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%

And that changes us.

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And if what we are
surrounding ourselves

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is with things that
bring us to know more,

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to understand more,
to connect more--

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%

>> As I sat pondering a
worthwhile conclusion to this

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:27.210 align:middle line:84%
film, I realized one
profound concept--

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
nobody has the answers.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
As ironic or vague
as this may sound,

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the answer was with
me all the time.

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
We spend our lives ruminating
on past and future events,

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
giving little, if any
attention to the present.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Playing victim to circumstance
seems easier than accepting

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
the fact that suffering is
the hand that pulls us out

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
of stagnation, and is possibly
best summed up by Rumi--

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
"This being human
is a guest house.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Every morning, a new arrival, a
joy, a depression, a meanness.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome and entertain them all.

01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Be grateful for
whatever comes your way,

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because each and
every moment has been

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:15.440 align:middle line:90%
sent as a guide from beyond."

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> As science or the rational
mind digs deeper and deeper

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
into reality, past the
superficial aspects,

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
we find out not only do we know
less than we thought we do,

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
we also are discovering
that what we thought was one

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
universe is a system
of multiverse.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
And we actually have a choice.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live in
a universe with no god,

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.910 align:middle line:84%
you can choose to
do that because it's

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the belief in our mind that
creates it or destroys it.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
When I ask myself, is there
a god, is there not a god,

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.680 align:middle line:90%
it really doesn't matter to me.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
If I choose to believe there
is no god and I'm wrong,

01:12:57.170 --> 01:12:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm in trouble.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
If I choose to believe there's
a god and I'm wrong, no problem.

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm just dead.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
That choice, it removes
any doubt from me.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Really, you can choose
to believe or disbelieve

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's totally
irrelevant, except to you.

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, there's
nothing, absolutely nothing,

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and everything to
gain by believing.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When you see a film, and you
know it's just a play of light

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.850 align:middle line:90%
on a surface.

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, you know that
that vast, absolute thing

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
is like a surface on which
there is this play of light,

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the surface
without the play of light.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a surface with
the play of light.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.800 align:middle line:10%
And why that's so
important is then

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.500 align:middle line:10%
you feel great
love and compassion

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.460 align:middle line:10%
for those other sensitive
beings in the unreally real who

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.000 align:middle line:10%
don't know that it's
only unreally real.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They think that their individual
selves, separate from others,

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:58.340 align:middle line:84%
is really real, and
then they suffer.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So Jivamukti, being
living and liberated,

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
means that you're
back with the living.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And you are liberated in
that you can take anything,

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
because you know that
it's only unreally real.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But you won't take
the other people

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
who think it's really real
continuing to really suffer.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, your drive
for absolute knowledge,

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and absolute freedom,
absolute bliss

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
becomes love and
compassion for those

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:29.392 align:middle line:90%
who do not have that condition.

01:14:29.392 --> 01:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%

just take for granted, I think,

Like, we're all in the
search for what is real

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.400 align:middle line:90%
as if it was somewhere else.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I prefer the unreal.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:43.669 align:middle line:84%
And like Castaneda said,
there's the tonal universe,

01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's the one
we think we're in,

01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're all conducting
ourselves correctly.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the nagual,
and that's the unknown.

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What is real is the light
of the self that exists in all

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.750 align:middle line:90%
of us, and that we have to feel.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I think everything
else is an illusion.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It's like a big hallucination.

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%

ego mind came up with.

01:15:11.296 --> 01:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
remains is consciousness.

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:15.544 align:middle line:84%
You remember when you were
living in the body of a child.

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Where's that body now?

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Now you're in an adult body.

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
A few years, you'll
leave this body,

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and then consciousness
will go to some other body.

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:26.210 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Now the trick is to access
that, to get to that.

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.324 align:middle line:90%
That's why you practice yoga.

things is impermanence.

If there is no separate
self, then that

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
means there's no separation
between even you and a god.

01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:40.670 align:middle line:90%
That goes beyond oneness.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.350 align:middle line:90%
