00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.440 align:middle line:10%
>> We were talking, while
we were taking a break,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.726 align:middle line:10%
or at least you were--

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:14.630 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
A new religion was invented
while you were actually

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.460 align:middle line:90%
taking your break.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And this is it.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:10%
And literally, it is the
belief that when you die,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.505 align:middle line:10%
your soul flies onto the
roof and get stuck there.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:30.365 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:10%
You can't take this
stuff too seriously.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Now then, as I said before,
you can't touch the Templars

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.838 align:middle line:90%
without scratching the Grail.

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to go
there, but you know what?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
You kind of have to.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The Grail is such
a complex subject.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So much has been
written about it.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:90%
It's like pyramids.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So much stuff is
written upon it.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And some of it's very good.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Some of it's complete nonsense.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all
this stuff in between.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, let
me go in this direction.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me just find out
what the Grail is about,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
because even I didn't know
what the Grail was about,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:90%
it was so confusing as a story.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, it's been
described as a chalice.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It's been described as a bowl,
a cauldron, a womb, a woman,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and even the holy bloodline,
just to really make

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
things even more complicated.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But the primary benefit that
seems to come from the Grail

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
is that it has the power to
restore life to the dead.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:90%
But the perks-- the perks.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:90%
The drugs.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Where's my scotch?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.453 align:middle line:90%
This organization, honestly.

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:46.253 align:middle line:90%
It's getting--

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:48.145 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But since restoring a
dead organism back to life

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
contradicts the
laws of nature, it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is very likely
that the phrase was

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
intended to be
taken metaphorically

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:90%
or even allegorical.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we already know, every
esoteric and gnostic tradition

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
conceal its most important
ideas in symbols--

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
important ideas in
symbols and metaphors.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And it did this as a means
to hide important information

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:90%
from abuse--

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and in my case, to
protect the writers

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
from torture, imprisonment,
and certain death.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So you use symbols to
convey information.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, let's
look at the earliest version

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of the story as it appeared
in the medieval era

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
to try and make
sense of the Grail.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had many
high-ranking sympathizers,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and one of them was
the enlightened Queen

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.595 align:middle line:90%
of France Eleanor of Aquitaine.

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If you don't think that
women were part of the plot

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:90%
back then, you're very mistaken.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
They very much were at
the center of the plot.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And in 1160, the
daughter of Eleanor,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
she becomes the patronness
of a poet called Cretien,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
who happens to live
in a town called

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Troye, which we met earlier--

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
named, incidentally,
after the town from where

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:90%
the Trojans came from.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So the poet Cretien
joins her court

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and writes a book called
"Le Conte del Graal."

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story in which a
long and seemingly futile quest

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
for a supreme
object is carefully

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
wrapped in a symbolism so as
to ward off charges of heresy

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
from the Church.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the very core,
the story's hero

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is a knight who is
mortally wounded.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
He trains with a
spiritual mentor

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and then embarks on
a long quest filled

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:90%
with all kinds of challenges.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet despite
the challenges, he

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
returns, whereupon he
weds a beautiful maiden,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and at which point his eyes
are opened to a great mystery.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a matter of
speaking, a dead man

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
is brought back to life.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:10%
A significant moment
in Cretien's story

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:10%
occurs when the hero is witness
to a procession in which

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:10%
a young, beautiful maiden
carries a radiant golden object

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:10%
on a salver.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:10%
And this is called the Grail.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, the salver is also a very
interesting part of the story

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:10%
because it is a ceremonial
tray made of silver.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:10%
So here, we also have
symbolism taking place,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:10%
because we have gold
on top of silver,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:10%
so the alchemical
union of the masculine

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:10%
and the feminine, also otherwise
known as the sun and the moon.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:90%
All the same story.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
This connection between this
important tray and the Grail

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
is crucial to understanding
what the Templars were actually

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:90%
doing in Portugal.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to bring
this up much later on,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:84%
also to test you to make sure
you're still paying attention.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
There are many iterations
of the story of the Grail,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and one later
iteration of the story

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:84%
adds a few more juicy
bits to the story.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:84%
In the later version,
there is a description

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of how a brotherhood of
the Grail quest is fed,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "By a stone
that fell from the sky."

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, this stone is very
unusual, because apparently, it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:90%
can revitalize the ill.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
It prolongs life.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:90%
It rebuilds vigor and youth.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And most important of all,
it is capable of resurrecting

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And it is referred
to as the Grail.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
what he was smoking,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
but obviously, such a
description is ridiculous.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.668 align:middle line:84%
Meteorites just don't
behave like this.

00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't bring people
back from the dead,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and they don't certainly
revitalize and prolong life.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But to the esoteric thinker
who reads such stories

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:84%
symbolically, this stone
that fell from the sky

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is essentially a
library of knowledge

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
that descends from a
very highest source.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, one of the
earliest versions

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:10%
of this interpretation,
of course,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.600 align:middle line:10%
is the tablets of laws that were
handed to some guy called Moses

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.625 align:middle line:10%
high up in a mountain.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:10%
And yet, if they
only took a look

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:10%
at what was happening in
Egypt back in 3,000 BC,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:10%
there right there in
front of your eyes, here

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:10%
are the two tablets of the laws
on the headdress of the god

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:10%
Amun that look suspiciously like
the two tablets that were later

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:10%
handed to Moses as well.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:10%
And of course, Amun is one of
the architects of the universe.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Grail story
of a dying person

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
who pursues divine wisdom
in the form of a sacred text

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and becomes risen by the
knowledge they contain,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:84%
this concept has been around
in one form or another

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:90%
since 2,700 BC.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And you find the
same story in China.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
You find the same story in
India and also in Egypt.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And in every single
case, they all

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
describe the spiritual
path of an initiate.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:10%
In every one of these
quests for divine knowledge,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:10%
the initiate learns to balance
the masculine and the feminine

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:10%
within, which allows the
person to remain faithful,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:10%
and I quote, "to the
maiden he marries."

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:10%
So this woman that this
person marries on the quest

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:10%
must have possessed
exceptional qualities,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:10%
because this man
protects her at any cost.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
He will lay down
his life for her.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, she is one
radiant, beautiful woman

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
because she is later referred
to as Sophis, otherwise known

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:90%
in Greek as Wisdom.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So this person is
laying down his life

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to marry this woman which is
the representation of wisdom

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:90%
She is the divine feminine.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
She is the Grail.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
She represents the knowledge
of the very highest degree,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
otherwise known as the
very laws of nature.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Powerful stuff.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So in all cases, the
knowledge, properly applied,

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:84%
liberates and invigorates
the individual

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
because its philosophy
becomes his or her

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:90%
spiritual foundation.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So in a matter of
speaking, by applying it,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
the initiate is
raised from ignorance.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:84%
He's literally
raised from the dead,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the term
becomes very important.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So how does all of this
apply to our good friends

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:90%
the Knights Templar?

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, the inner
brotherhood, obviously,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
from what we've said before,
was pursuing a spiritual quest

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that culminated in a ritual
in which the candidates were

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:90%
declared risen.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Now we are getting very
close to discovering

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
ancient restricted knowledge,

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
secret ritual chambers, and why
the Templars created a kingdom

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
within a kingdom far
from Rome in order

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to practice in peace a
doctrine that allowed newcomers

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
to be initiated into very
ancient mystery secrets.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.542 align:middle line:84%
It certainly would explain
why people loved the Templars.

00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
They just happened to
show up on their doorstep

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say,
please, take my land.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Take all my money, what
little I have, and everything.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that they
were just nine guys

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:10%
suggests that the
threat of violence

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:10%
really wasn't high on the list.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:10%
It's not exactly threatening.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.129 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, they were offering
something of extreme importance

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:10%
to people.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:10%
And back in the
day, the Church had

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:10%
a monopoly on all this stuff.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:10%
If the Templars were offering
something different, of course

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:10%
you're going to make
friends with them.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:10%
So let's see where
all of this leads

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:10%
to in relation to Portugal.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:10%
If you recall, the Grail
is a gold shining light

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:10%
or object carried on a salver.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And a salver is a
very unusual word.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.718 align:middle line:10%
And I love unusual
words because once you

00:09:05.718 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:10%
start looking at etymology,
they start giving you

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of information.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:10%
In early Latin, salver
is salve, and it means

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.148 align:middle line:10%
sampling of food or drink.

00:09:16.148 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm wondering, what this got
to do with the Grail story

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:10%
and a ceremonial tray?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:10%
And it comes from salve,
which means to save.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:10%
And the same word
exists in Portuguese.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's the foundation
of our modern term salvation.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And of course, if
you look at this

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:10%
from an esoteric point
of view, salvation

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:10%
is the reward for
pursuing the knowledge

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:10%
for the attainment of the
Grail, for this knowledge

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:10%
of the working
mechanics of nature.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So they begin to
wonder, was salvation

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
a sufficient motivation for a
handful of guys, some warrior

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
monks, who came from northern
Europe across hostile terrain,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to embark on a
quest in Jerusalem

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to locate ancient texts,
then sail 2,000 miles west

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:90%
to set up a Portuguese crown?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
After all, the Catholic
Church back in the day

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:90%
was the predominant power.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It had a monopoly on salvation.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And their version,
according to the facts,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:90%
was extremely dubious.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they weren't saving.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
They were actually imprisoning
and murdering their way

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:90%
through the whole of Europe.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And from this
point in our story,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the coincidences
begin to compound.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Here is the center
of the Templar

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:90%
world in the 12th century.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not in France.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not England.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not in Jerusalem.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It is a third of the territory
of the country of Portugal,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Europe's first nation state.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And they inherited
this little yellow area

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:90%
in a really unusual way.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And I love it when stories
are unusual because it's

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
as though they do
it deliberately

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:90%
to get your attention later on.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happens.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:84%
After King Alfonso secures
the Portuguese nation state,

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
he awards a third of his
country to the Knights.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Very weird.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The caveat for this
donation was that the land

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
should be free from all
official and ecclesiastical

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
interference.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, first of all,
it's a lot of land.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it free for them to
do whatever they want in here,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:84%
it's free from the Church and
interference in the Portuguese

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:90%
state itself.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet they are in the
Portuguese state itself.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
A good portion of this territory
back in the 12th century

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:90%
was complete wasteland.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It was the medium point between
the fighting between the Arabs

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:90%
and the Portuguese.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were literally
on Portuguese soil.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And it was wasteland.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet this territory
that the Templars

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
were adamant on receiving
it was received in trade

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
with the Church for a capital
city and rich agricultural land

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:90%
that the Templars already owned.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So one therefore has to ask
and question this logic.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Templars negotiate
such a ridiculous deal?

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's as though they were after
something of great importance

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:90%
that was in this territory.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
It suggested there was
a preplanned thought

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted this
soil because there

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
was some underlying
force that they

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
felt would underpin
the idea that they

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:90%
were trying to promote.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, to this very day,
that little stretch of yellow

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
marks a very ancient tract of
land that was run by the Celts.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And the name, still
exists to this very day

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
for this territory, is
the territory of Beta.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a Celt
or if you're Irish,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll know this woman because
she is the mother of the gods.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING GAELIC] If you
want to write that down,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
spell that for you.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not phonetic.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
territory, literary,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of the mother of the gods,
the divine virgin herself.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
obviously sought this

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
because there was something of
great importance on this land

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that was directly related
to a divine virgin

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and had been so for
thousands of years.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So it was here that the
Templars created this kingdom

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:90%
within a kingdom.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And they continued living there
long after they were wiped out

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:90%
by the Church.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:10%
The other place where they
also survive, of course,

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:10%
is in Scotland.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.162 align:middle line:10%
And I'll talk about that later.

00:13:09.162 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:10%
So this, again,
was the focal point

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:10%
of that territory,
the town of Thamara,

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:10%
this mysterious little town
with gorgeous little Templar

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:10%
castle on top.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:10%
Lots of pastry shops
and other things.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:10%
And as I said earlier,
it means palm tree.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:10%
But again, palm trees
couldn't grow there back then.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:10%
It was too cold to
grow palm trees.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:10%
Why would they name
a town a palm tree

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:10%
if there was no palm trees?

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:10%
And why, in this Portuguese
iteration, the town means "to

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:10%
drink."

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, how do you drink a town?

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:10%
No idea.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the name itself
that the Templars

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:10%
gave it is the key to
the actual mystery.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Well consider this.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
The ritual of resurrection
practiced by the Templars

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and the Essenes
before them was based

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
on the ancient Egyptian
ritual and its central figure,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
the god-man Osiris, who
takes on the symbol of a palm

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:84%
tree in one of the versions
of the story following

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:90%
his own resurrection ritual.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:10%
So the Templars may
have been implying

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:10%
that the town of
Thamara is itself

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:10%
the doorway into that
ritual, particularly

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:10%
its most interesting building
on top of the actual hill.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:10%
And here it is, the rotunda.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful building.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:10%
The fact is that just as
Cretien, the poet Cretien,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:10%
is sitting in Troye
writing the Grail story,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.315 align:middle line:10%
the Templars are
laying the cornerstone

00:14:27.315 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:10%
for this unusual round church.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:90%
What a strange coincidence.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's been sitting
there all along.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it's too good
of a connection to pass up.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
relationship going on here.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And when you go there--

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and you should do.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It stands inside a castle on a
limestone hill above the town,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and it bears a
striking resemblance

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:84%
to the Abbey of Notre Dame
on Mount Sinai and Jerusalem,

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
where our former friends,
the order of Sion,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
one of the formative groups that
literally created the Templars,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:90%
comes from.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a visual
relationship.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, before the Templars
set about building this,

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
they first erected a church
at the bottom of the hill.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lovely church.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And they dedicated it
to a divine virgin.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Surprise, surprise.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The site had already
been famous and used

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
for at least 2,500
years before them,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and it too was venerated
for a divine virgin.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:10%
And we know this because
the very blatant symbol

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:10%
of Isis and the divine
feminine is placed prominently

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:10%
above the altar.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:10%
So there's a pentagram.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:10%
Now, what on earth
is a pentagram

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:10%
doing in a church, in
a Christian church?

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:10%
Oh, dear.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:10%
So this is what I'm saying,
that the temples are still alive

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.642 align:middle line:10%
and well in Portugal.

00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Portugal's a very
Catholic country,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.213 align:middle line:84%
and yet they can still
get away with this today.

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
This whole building's been
totally remodeled and restored,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and yet the pentagram remains.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
There are people within this
town that are maintaining

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
a very quiet status quo.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk to
the right people,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
then you come across the right
people in your coincidences,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.742 align:middle line:84%
you get to hear all kinds
of interesting information.

00:16:03.742 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it is.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.393 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the funny thing.

00:16:12.393 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
During the restoration
work that was conducted

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
at this church in the
1940s, the builders

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
found a tunnel that
goes under the crypt,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and it leads under the river.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And it continues for one mile
to the central plaza of Thamara,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and it leads to this very
unusual Templar church

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to John the Baptist.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
They weren't subtle
about these things.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if
you're a Freemason,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
you'll appreciate the
checkerboard pattern

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:90%
in front of the building today.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So this wonderful church
is connected a mile away

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:90%
by this underground tunnel.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of digging.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But there is a wonderful
feature, and it's right there.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.135 align:middle line:84%
And everybody goes
right past it.

00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a close look at this.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a bas relief.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very old.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
It was put there at the
inauguration of the church.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Highly eroded, but
you can still make out

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
the shape of a dog and a lion
and this kind of fleur-de-lis

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
coming between
them in the center.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.717 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, everybody
goes right past this.

00:17:11.717 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:90%
No one pays any attention.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.758 align:middle line:90%
They'll take a picture.

00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't think much about it.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're an ancient
Egyptian looking at this,

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
you think, well,
wait a minute, that's

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.600 align:middle line:84%
actually a very interesting
symbol, because the dog is

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:90%
the dog star.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:90%
That's Sirius.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And Sirius has always
been associated

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.260 align:middle line:84%
with the repository of divine
knowledge, especially when you

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
put it next to an
image of a lion,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
because lion is the
symbol of Regulus,

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and Regulus in so many of
the old mystery schools

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
represents the doorway
to the mysteries.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have two
animals representing

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
two constellations that are
related to ancient mystery

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:90%
schools.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And in between them, this
fleur-de-lis in a stylized form

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
comes up between them, the very
symbol of the holy bloodline.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
What on Earth has this got
to do with this church,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and why is it there?

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, you go inside.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful place.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It is filled with the most
wonderful pagan symbology.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's a highly
Catholic part of the world,

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and yet you find effigies
of the green man everywhere.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that have no place in a
Catholic place of veneration,

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
although it may
surprise you to find

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that there are more
effigies of the green man,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:84%
the regenerative god of
nature which basically spews

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
vegetation from his mouth--

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And he is reborn again.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
He rises from the dead on
the winter solstice sunrise.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:84%
You find more images of this
guy in churches in Europe

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
than images of Mary
and Jesus combined.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Look closely.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:90%
They're all there.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's also, in addition
to this wonderful figure

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.482 align:middle line:84%
of the green man, a pillar
with these two dragons emitting

00:18:47.482 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:90%
something out of their mouth.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, that to me, as a
person who seeks energy

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and subtle energies on
the land and as a dowser,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
has always been a symbol of
a position in the building

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
where the energy
lines are attracted.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you know what
you're looking for--

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and as I said before, every
single ancient sacred site,

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
including the ancient
churches on top of them,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
are all positioned on top of
the crossing of the Earth's

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:90%
telluric currents.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you find
symbols like this,

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
it was the way that the
architects communicated

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to show you, if you
stand on the spot,

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
you're standing on
the energy lines.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to start feeling--

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very
technical term--

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:24.750 align:middle line:90%
the tingly-winglies.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.598 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And you do.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:90%
You stand here.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.395 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel
your tingly-winglies.

00:19:30.395 --> 00:19:33.188 align:middle line:84%
And if you've done
this, you know this.

00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
If you've been to sacred
sites long enough,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
you begin to soak up the
energy like a sponge.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
develop qualities

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:90%
that you never thought you had.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
You begin to develop
a certain clairvoyant

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
ability to see through things
and you seem to hear things.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it now
becomes second nature.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing exactly at
the spot where that picture is

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:84%
on the right in the
gap between the two

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
pillars of the green
man and the dragon.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it's as
if a TV screen just

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:90%
comes down in front of my--

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in my head and shows
me this alignment that

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:84%
goes between the rotunda,
which is on the hill behind me,

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
threads the needle
through this altar.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:90%
There's a tiny gap.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.625 align:middle line:84%
And it continues, and
it's sharing me Jerusalem.

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
this is very weird.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But I've had enough
experience to understand

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that weird things happen for
you to write them down and then

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
go and research it later.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So I basically went
back onto Google Earth,

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
which is a really addictive
and pretty accurate program.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what is it
true that if I'm standing here

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm threading a needle,
that there is somehow

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:84%
this church with this bas
relief behind me of this dog,

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the image of Sirius,
and Regulus, the lion,

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that somehow there's an
alignment between the church

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:84%
of St. John the
Baptist and Mount

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Zion and Jerusalem and the
rotunda on top of the hill?

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
2,000 miles long.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
That's one hell of a
threading of a needle.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And this just comes from
being, basically, standing

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit of place,
allowing yourself to there

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and be receptive
without a point of view.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, it comes from
your head, comes from your ego.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It has to come from a
neutral point of view

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
when you have these
things that just happen.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you do the
research, it's there.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
follow the clues.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.902 align:middle line:84%
And it does end up literally
on the Church of Mount Zion.

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:10%
I thought that was pretty
good for a day's work

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:10%
until like I thought, well,
I've got Capricorn rising.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:10%
I can't possibly let
the story end there.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:10%
I am a bit more
curious than that.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at the three
places in Jerusalem,

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:10%
the three properties
that are intimately

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:10%
associated with
this story today,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.648 align:middle line:10%
with the Templars and
the Order of Sion.

00:21:45.648 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's a church
of the Holy Sepulcher

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:10%
where the two original Templars
really began the story.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:10%
There's Solomon's
Stables, which are the one

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:10%
place that the Templars asked
the King of Jerusalem, hey,

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:10%
would you mind
vacating your house

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:10%
because we really
want to live here?

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.212 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, hey, absolutely.

00:22:03.212 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:10%
And I think the King was
bigger than they were.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.503 align:middle line:10%
He could've just beaten them up.

00:22:06.503 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:10%
But no.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:10%
No, please.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Go ahead, have my house.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:10%
And he's the King, and they're
just a couple of tramps.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.712 align:middle line:10%
You put that next to--

00:22:14.712 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:10%
put a pin in there,
and put the third pin

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:10%
literally on the center of
the Abbey on Mount Zion,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:10%
and you get--

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:10%
and I mean a perfect
isosceles triangle.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And I mean absolutely perfect.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, now,
what are the chances

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.845 align:middle line:90%
of that happening by accident?

00:22:28.845 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, what happens

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:90%
if you bisect the triangle?

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:90%
This is where you end up.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.825 align:middle line:10%
You end up in Egypt
inside the Osireion.

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:10%
You can't make this
stuff if you could.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:10%
It's either right or it's wrong.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:10%
You can do this on
Google Earth yourself.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:10%
So this is supposedly,
if you follow

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:10%
some of the traditions,
an underground chamber.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it isn't.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:10%
There's a recent
geological account

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:10%
which I read, which I hope
it wasn't yours, Robert.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it is.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, there's
new evidence that

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
shows that the mud that's built
up around the actual temple

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.823 align:middle line:84%
is the build up of mud now
from over 12,000 years.

00:23:09.823 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So originally, it was a
freestanding structure

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
resembling a natural cave.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So apparently, this is where
the resurrection mysteries

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
of Osiris were
supposedly enacted

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
by initiates who were admitted
into an exclusive brotherhood.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they built
the temple of Abydos

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:84%
above it in this
underground chamber,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.480 align:middle line:84%
there is this mural depicting
the figurative resurrection

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:90%
of Osiris.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about the
connection between living

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
resurrection that starts in
Portugal, goes to Jerusalem,

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
gets bisected, and ends up back
at its original point in Egypt.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a lot
of geometric connections

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:90%
spanning thousands of years.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're asking
you to follow the plot.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to Thamara.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
This is the end of that
other imaginary line,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's the rotunda.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And since then, it's become less
of a freestanding structure.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It's now had a convent
bolted onto it.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was done
in the 14th century.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful place.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.330 align:middle line:90%
You should see it for itself.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's also, by the way, the
terminus of the tunnel that

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
began at that first church
that the Templars built.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So 1 and 1/2 miles under
the river, under the town,

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:90%
up the hill, and then here.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of digging.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The Templars apparently
just loved digging

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:90%
wherever they went.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And all around this building,
this beautiful rotunda

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and the chapel that
was built around it,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds
of symbols and clues

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.295 align:middle line:84%
that secret esoteric work
was once practiced here.

00:24:37.295 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't go
around advertising

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:84%
these things, least
of all at a time when

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:90%
the Church is after you.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So you want to keep it
kind of under the radar.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
If you spend a whole day
here-- and I spent many,

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
many days in the convent
around the rotunda--

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:90%
it's full of bases.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds, hundreds
of bases on the ceiling.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And never did I
imagined that walking

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
around all day long
looking at the ceiling

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:90%
would be so productive.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the bases
that I found, and there's

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them, there's only
one that looks like this.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is the figure
of Hermes Trismegistus,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:90%
the thrice great god of wisdom.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may know him
by another name, Djehuty,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian god of
wisdom, who also happens

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to be renamed by
the Greeks as Thoth,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:90%
the man with the ibis head.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking here at the
very symbol of ancient wisdom.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
He is the guardian
of the mysteries.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.370 align:middle line:84%
He also happens to be
the guardian of the gate

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
into the other world
which initiates accessed

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
during an out-of-body
ritual performed

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:84%
in secret underground
chambers often referred

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to as bridal chambers, because
that's where the initiate was

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
coupled with his divine bride,
which goes back to the Grail

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.225 align:middle line:84%
story about the guy
who goes walkabout,

00:25:54.225 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
has his extraordinary
experience,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
comes back and weds
his divine woman.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, if this is the
only place in the entire area

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that has this marker, makes a
wonderful marker for locating

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:90%
a restricted chamber.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:90%
This is how you think.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.422 align:middle line:84%
And under it, there is a
door, and you can't get in.

00:26:13.422 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I talked to the director,
and I said, I'm just a schmuck

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
walking around.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind letting me know
what's going on under here?

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, absolutely.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I find that when you behave like
an idiot, they leave you alone.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I really believe that.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And you open the door.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:90%
He opens the door.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We go down a spiral staircase
that goes clockwise,

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the esoteric direction
of going into something.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got to pay
attention to these signs.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, there is a
room that is out of access

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:84%
to the public, and it's
described as a wine cellar.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm no connoisseur
of wine, but I

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:90%
do know one thing about wine.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to find a very
dry space to store wine

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:90%
for obvious reasons.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
This is perhaps the most humid
part of the entire convent.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
They may have used it in
recent years to store wine.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The monks only left
about 80 years ago.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't make any sense.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You did not store wine in
a very humid environment.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It sits three floors
below the rotunda's floor.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It is full of symbolism for
a wine storage department.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
look at the ceiling again.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can read
all kinds of things

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.740 align:middle line:84%
into this if you
want to, but I just

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.573 align:middle line:84%
thought it was unusual
that there is exactly

00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
seven bases on the ceiling, as
though someone is referencing

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the chakras of the human body
or the notes of the music

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:90%
scale, the do-re-me.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, it does turn out that
when you measure the room,

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.060 align:middle line:84%
its design is exactly
the double octave.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So something about
the bases is telling

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
about the way the
room was designed

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:90%
to induce a certain effect.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, when you do
the lightest hum in there,

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:90%
the reverb is just beautiful.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It immediately puts you
in a state of reflection.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.382 align:middle line:84%
I can't really describe it any
other way unless you go there.

00:27:56.382 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So you look at all
the bases, and there's

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:84%
two that differ
from all the others.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is in the place where
the crown chakra would be.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And it is actually the
depiction of the crown chakra

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:84%
as depicted in Eastern cultures,
with one big difference.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The circle is divided
exactly into 17 rays, which

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is a very unusual and awkward
number to divide a circle into.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.317 align:middle line:84%
So I have never quite
figured out what

00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:84%
it means, except for
the fact that when I've

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:84%
talked to Freemasons who
are good friends of mine,

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:84%
they said it's actually
one of the closest

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.268 align:middle line:84%
held secrets in Freemasonry
is the 17th degree.

00:28:30.268 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with something to do

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.647 align:middle line:84%
with energy and the way you can
work energy in a certain way.

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
elucidate any more on that

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not a Mason.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But I also found a wonderful
numerical correspondence here

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.120 align:middle line:84%
because apparently, there
are 17 side chambers that

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:84%
make up the Osireion
at Abydos, which

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:84%
is where this story
eventually ends up,

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:84%
back in the resurrection
chamber of Osiris.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Now this symbol, this bas on
the ceiling, has at its center

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:90%
this rose.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the world of
secret societies,

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the members would always
conduct their secret meetings

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:84%
in a place called sub rosa, and
it means "beneath the rose."

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was a symbol and a sign
to candidates of secret mystery

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
schools that allowed
them to share and receive

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
privileged information without
the fear of going to jail

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:90%
or being killed.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.963 align:middle line:90%
So this is worth considering.

00:29:20.963 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I can't totally prove
this, but I'm just

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
saying that the
symbols are there,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and they make you
think that this perhaps

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:90%
is not a wine cellar.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Even more so when you consider
that right under that bas,

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:90%
there's a shaft.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And officially, it's
a well, except when

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:84%
you look down there,
there's absolutely no water.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't look like there's
anything at the bottom that

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:90%
could even hold the water.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's placed
very conveniently

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and impractically
and dangerously

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:90%
in front of the door.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the dark, believe me,
it's very easy to fall into.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I nearly did.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It was actually covered
with a little piece of wood.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So we must ask, therefore,
if it doesn't hold water,

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:90%
where does it lead?

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I came across an article
from the 19th century

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
of one of the monks
that lived here,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and they talked about how they
were doing some reparation

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
work to the grounds
back then, and they

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.330 align:middle line:84%
found after a heavy
rain an entire track

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of this building
that seemed to be an air shaft.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It was part of a
tunnel that seemed

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:84%
to be going towards the
rotunda into a fabled ritual

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.560 align:middle line:84%
chamber which no one
seemed to know much about.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
there were shafts

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that were coming out of the
ground that provided air

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:90%
along this tunnel.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So possibly what
we're looking at

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is one of these
very, very shafts.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the same thing is
found in Rosslyn in Scotland.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that also was found by
the authors of that work

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to be a tunnel that
goes under Rosslyn.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are also these little
shafts which are basically

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:84%
not designed to hold
any water, but they

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
would be fantastic for
allowing air to go in there.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The second bas that differs
from all the others in this room

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the cross with
the rose at the center.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I said earlier
that so much money

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
has been spent to tell
people in the world

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that the order of Sion on
and the Priory of Sion,

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:84%
as it became known,
never existed.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's funny,
because this is the logo.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was put there
in the 15th century.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear evidence that
the order not only survived

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:84%
the persecution after the
Templars were run aground.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
It survived and it was
living happily and thereafter

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.792 align:middle line:90%
in Portugal.

00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't
know if any of you

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.708 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with one of the
most famous figures in history

00:31:25.708 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
from Portugal, a guy
called Henry the Navigator.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:90%
He was basically hero.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:84%
He actually didn't do much
navigating, as it turns out.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:84%
The Portuguese are very
proud of their history

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:90%
of navigating around the world.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I found a map which
seems to precede Columbus

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
by 40 years which shows
the coast of Labrador

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
in Newfoundland with the
Portuguese Templar flag planted

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:48.675 align:middle line:90%
firmly on it.

00:31:48.675 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, dear/ That
shouldn't be there.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And they kept this very quiet.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Columbus went to
ask the Portuguese

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
about how to get to
the West, and they

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, I have no idea.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:90%
It's just water.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
They'd been going there
for a long, long time.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The Portuguese were
very curious mariners.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And Henry the
Navigator apparently

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:90%
was the head of the navy.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in a certain respect
he was a navigator,

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.610 align:middle line:84%
but in French, which is
the predominant language,

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:84%
romantic language of the period,
"navigator" is "nautilier."

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And Nautilier was the
head of the order of Sion.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:90%
That was the term.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So Henry the
Navigator was not only

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:90%
the head of the Templar order.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:84%
He was a grand
master in Portugal.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
He was also head of
the order of Sion,

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:90%
which supposedly didn't exist.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So this guy must have belonged
to a fictitious organization.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love this stuff.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Here are other esoteric
symbols again in this room.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
There are green men
all over the place.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:90%
There is the horn of cornucopia.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, another
esoteric symbol showing

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that the room has some
association with the gifts that

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.880 align:middle line:84%
come pouring forth
from the understanding

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:90%
of secret knowledge.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a wine cellar,
I'm the barber of Seville.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But my main purpose
still and focus

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.820 align:middle line:84%
was to find out more
about the rotunda,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
this mysterious building at
the top of the town of Thamara,

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
this palm tree, and to
discover absolute proof once

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and for all that the
secret ritual chamber still

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:84%
exists under this building,
and that like other sects

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.040 align:middle line:84%
before them, the Templars
were performing the raising

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.000 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies under or
inside this room.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:90%
The rotunda is an enigma.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I was born not far from it.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It's magnetized me for years,
almost like a mistress,

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:90%
a good mistress.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And not surprisingly,
because it's a huge enigma.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.470 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, it's
supposed to be a church,

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's described in the
tourist brochures as such.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet the church that
the Templars always

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:84%
used on a daily basis was the
one at the bottom of the hill

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that I showed earlier,
the Church of Notre Dame.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So why build another one within
walking distance of the first?

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't seem to add up.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the fact
that during times of siege,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
the most secure building inside
the perimeter of the castle

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:90%
was the rotunda.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet nobody-- nobody
was allowed inside it,

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:90%
which is a bit weird.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they had been allowed
inside this building,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:90%
there was no door.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.630 align:middle line:90%
How the hell did you get in?

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out the
only way into this building

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:84%
was from under the floor from
where the altar should be.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But never, ever did this
building ever have an altar.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:84%
So the temple, with all
of this evidence in mind,

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:84%
suggests that it was
designed for a purpose other

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.550 align:middle line:90%
than worship.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And its keystone
to this building

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.900 align:middle line:84%
was laid on the very same
year that Cretien of Troyes

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:84%
moves into the namesake
town to begin writing

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.824 align:middle line:90%
his wonderful Grail story.

00:34:47.824 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's
more coincidences

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:84%
than meets the eye here,
because in his story,

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the Grail is carried by a woman
on a ceremonial silver tray

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:90%
called a salver.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Hold that thought for a second.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.920 align:middle line:84%
During the visit to
the town's archives--

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and here's the inside
of the rotunda again.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It's been polychromed in
the last few centuries.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it was
absolutely dead plain.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The Cistercians were not
into putting any decoration

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful building.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
During a visit to
the town's archives,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I came across an account
of restoration work

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that was conducted
in the 1940s, and it

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.600 align:middle line:84%
describes how the
exterior of the rotunda

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:84%
had been coated with
reinforced concrete.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I spoke to the directors at
the rotunda, and I said, well,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:84%
do we know the whereabouts
of this secret chamber that

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:84%
is supposedly in the middle of
these pillars under the floor?

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.498 align:middle line:84%
Because all evidence seems
to show that it's there.

00:35:39.498 --> 00:35:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we
can get into the building.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.740 align:middle line:90%
That's just fiction.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They're just making
all that stuff up.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Never been evidence of
any underground chamber.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's funny,
because there's

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.630 align:middle line:84%
a 1940s account in the town
archives that clearly states,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, that the
concrete that they

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:84%
put on the exterior
of the building

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the entrance and
hid the entrance to what

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.570 align:middle line:90%
was then described as a crypt.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So the builders must also
been smoking something weird,

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:84%
because builders usually
don't do that kind of thing.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:90%
They are very matter of fact.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to
brick up an entrance,

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.733 align:middle line:84%
they will break up
an entrance, and it

00:36:13.733 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:90%
becomes a matter of fact.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It's written in
the town's records.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Why would you even deny that?

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, prior to that story,
there was an oral account

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:90%
by an elderly resident.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I love talking
to elderly people

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:84%
because they know
some really fun stuff.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And he recalls an
instance at the end

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th century
that was basically

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
committed to oral memory
through his entire family.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's so good,
I've put this on my notes.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to quote him verbatim
because it's wonderful.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:90%
This is what he said.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:10%
"It was said in old times that
master masons and carpenters

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:10%
were hired from the town
to work on the maintenance

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:10%
of the castle of Thamara.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:10%
It was the habit of
one of these masters

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:10%
to return home and register
the alterations made

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.320 align:middle line:10%
inside the castle because
these would continue

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.070 align:middle line:10%
until much of what was old
would be made unrecognizable

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.680 align:middle line:10%
or made to disappear.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that riled in the most

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.570 align:middle line:84%
was the disfiguration of
the beautiful and intriguing

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Arab pathway that the
old monks of the temple

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
used in their ceremonies
and led directly

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:90%
to the basement of the rotunda."

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:10%
Whoops.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:10%
"Even in those days, the
brothers living in the convent

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:10%
used to share from
memory stories

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:10%
with the Masons of how
the Templar master ordered

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.330 align:middle line:10%
the pathway leading to
it to be constructed

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:10%
in the Arabic
style, and that both

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:10%
were used not just for
religious ceremonies

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:10%
but also for the
investiture of new knights."

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.850 align:middle line:10%
There is a big clue right there.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:46.920 align:middle line:84%
"The monks also spoke
of the same Templar

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:84%
master returning from the
Holy Land with many scrolls."

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.510 align:middle line:90%
A-ha.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:84%
"He kept them safely in
the room excavated out

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:84%
of the rock, which had a
doorway the monks refer to as

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:90%
the Gate to the Other World.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:84%
This doorway rested on
very ancient stonework

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:84%
upon whose uprights
the Templars carved

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:84%
dragons, and on the lintel
a kind of winged serpent.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:10%
Tradition states that an old Jew
was the only person permitted

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:10%
to enter the cave to work on
the translation of the scrolls.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.060 align:middle line:10%
Later, this man spoke of
the results of his labor

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.250 align:middle line:10%
and how several
volumes of manuscripts

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:10%
had been translated into Latin."

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love this stuff.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And yet, so far to
the Orthodox people,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:90%
this place does not exist.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:84%
This underground chamber and
this tunnel do not exist.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
it in local memory.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.822 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
this at length.

00:38:39.822 --> 00:38:42.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what happened
to the scrolls, but we do

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.280 align:middle line:84%
know that the person,
the Templar master that

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.290 align:middle line:84%
brought the scrolls
back from the Holy Land,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
was none other than a man
called Gualdino Paes, who

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
happens to be one of those
five Templar procurators

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.560 align:middle line:84%
who were sent on a
secret mission in 1125

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:84%
by the Grand Master
himself, Hugues de Payens,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:90%
to create a Portuguese crown.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So the story, the oral account,
links up with historical fact

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:03.690 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Ha-ha.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
All this is officially
denied, of course.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't exist.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But oh, there's a
bit of a problem,

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:14.670 align:middle line:84%
because when UNESCO gave the
Portuguese government quite

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of money to
start beautifying

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
the perimeter of the
castle of Thamara,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.000 align:middle line:84%
they cleared an area of brush
around the original gate,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and oh my God, it reveals
the actual entrance

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:84%
to a cave, which is a bit
inconvenient because that

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist
apparently, and nor

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.030 align:middle line:84%
does the lintel with the
dragons and the serpents

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:84%
carved upon it, which is
there to this very day.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And you try going there
with official permission.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They deny even,
when you're pointing

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:90%
at it, that it actually exists.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:90%
They said, oh, no.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just an entrance to a mine.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, so you're
going to dig a mine

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:84%
under the foundation
of the Tower

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:90%
of the main gate of a castle?

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Are you mad?

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.600 align:middle line:90%
So all of this is still there.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, there
is a ritual chamber

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.700 align:middle line:84%
under the tour of the rotunda
because so many accounts

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:90%
are pointing to that direction.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:84%
The oral accounts talk
about how this chamber was

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
used for the
investiture of knights

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that used to be indoctrinated
into the inner brotherhood

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.993 align:middle line:90%
of the Templars.

00:40:06.993 --> 00:40:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the highest
grade of initiation

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:84%
was the resurrection
ritual that was always

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.310 align:middle line:84%
conducted in a specific
chamber, usually called

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:84%
a bridal chamber,
where you are connected

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.420 align:middle line:90%
with your divine bride.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Here is the inside
of the rotunda,

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.820 align:middle line:84%
the bit on top of the
chamber that doesn't exist.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And a big clue that there
was a ritual going on here

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and it was associated
with the ancient mysteries

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:90%
is actually in the windows.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.350 align:middle line:90%
They are made of honeycombs.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the only place, the
only Templar building

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to find, that
has this particular shape

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.180 align:middle line:90%
of window.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.722 align:middle line:84%
And they are still,
to this very day,

00:40:41.722 --> 00:40:44.920 align:middle line:84%
they still have the honeycomb
paint on the top there

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
you can see all that
on the right-hand side.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big clue,
because the ancient chambers

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that were used way before
the time of the Templar--

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking going back
at least 2000 BC--

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
all across Europe and
certainly the Middle East,

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.520 align:middle line:84%
all of these chambers used
for the very same ritual

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.280 align:middle line:84%
were either built in
the shape of a beehive

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
or were decorated in
a honeycomb pattern.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.408 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, what
the Templars are saying

00:41:09.408 --> 00:41:10.450 align:middle line:90%
is that you are sitting--

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
standing inside
a bridal chamber.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where you become
married to the divine wisdom

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a female
deity, an eternal virgin.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And the priestesses in the old
days who actually administered

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.640 align:middle line:84%
the initiate to be taken out
of the secret ritual chamber--

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and they used to be
brought out at daylight

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:90%
to face the rising sun.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:90%
These people were called bees.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
same epitaph that

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.440 align:middle line:84%
was given to the
people that were

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.630 align:middle line:90%
upholding a holy bloodline.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.270 align:middle line:84%
This is why so many Egyptian
pharaohs that were supposedly

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.148 align:middle line:84%
associated with
this holy bloodline

00:41:45.148 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Merovingian
kings were always

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.330 align:middle line:84%
buried with hundreds of gold
bees in their sarcophagi.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So it brings us back
again to the Grail story.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.560 align:middle line:84%
This is literally a
visual interpretation

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of the seeker that
marries the maiden.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.462 align:middle line:84%
He is married the
building itself,

00:42:00.462 --> 00:42:02.920 align:middle line:84%
because the processes that are
taking place in the building

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.150 align:middle line:84%
have not just made the
resurrection ritual possible.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:84%
He has now become part of
the actual building itself.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:90%
He has come to see the light.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
important building.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I can't spend enough
time at this place.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I take a couple of groups
there every couple of years,

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:84%
once we've got out of
the cake shop, that is.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Very hard to get them
out of the cake shop.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But here's the best
part of the story.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.983 align:middle line:84%
The Templars-- it's very curious
that the Templars did not

00:42:29.983 --> 00:42:31.900 align:middle line:84%
call this building a
rotunda, even though I've

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.700 align:middle line:84%
been calling it a
rotunda because it

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.980 align:middle line:90%
has a sort of rotunda shape.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Portuguese don't refer
to it as a rotunda either,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.498 align:middle line:84%
although the word also means
the same thing in Portuguese.

00:42:42.498 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Templars called
it something else.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.180 align:middle line:90%
They called it a Charola.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was so blindingly obvious
that it took me all this time

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.295 align:middle line:84%
looking at this building
to find out the very thing

00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
searching for all along,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because when you look
at the word "Charola"

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and you translate
it into English,

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:02.920 align:middle line:84%
it literally translates as
a salver, a ceremonial tray.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
This building is the tray upon
which the Grail is delivered.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:84%
What an unusual name
to give a building.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The secret is literally
hardwired into the building.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the processes that

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
take place inside this
geometric building sited

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.530 align:middle line:84%
at the intersection
of two of the Earth's

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.980 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic currents
generates an environment

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that offers anyone
inside it direct access

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:84%
to the Grail, offers
direct access to knowledge.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And that knowledge is
achieved by undertaking

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
a near-death experience.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Pretty cool stuff, isn't it?

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:39.005 align:middle line:84%
Took me 15 years
to work that out.

00:43:39.005 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was worth it.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some other
ritual places of the Templars,

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.353 align:middle line:84%
because there are quite a
few of them in Portugal,

00:43:45.353 --> 00:43:46.300 align:middle line:90%
and they're very fun.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.842 align:middle line:84%
Don't get too
frightened by the name.

00:43:47.842 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It really meant
something very profound.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.290 align:middle line:84%
"Monsanto" literally
means "a sacred mount."

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Funny how words can go through
this ebb and flow of life

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.310 align:middle line:90%
become something very sinister.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:06.195 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of evidence
that the Templars may also

00:44:06.195 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:84%
have performed resurrection
rituals at other of their most

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.290 align:middle line:90%
venerated centers.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of them.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, fantastic place,
mostly because my grandfather

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.980 align:middle line:84%
used to be a sheepherder
on this hill.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And he used to do so in
snow, and he wore no shoes.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's a real man.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Kids these days, they
haven't got a chance.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Wimps.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's a wonderful place.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, right
next to the castle walls,

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:37.315 align:middle line:84%
they built a church
dedicated to, of course, Mary

00:44:37.315 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:90%
of Magdalene.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And it is aligned to the
northeast, which is usually

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
a good giveaway that the
original site on which it

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.398 align:middle line:90%
stands is extremely ancient.

00:44:46.398 --> 00:44:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most ancient
sites in the world

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.180 align:middle line:84%
are always aligned
to the northeast.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the alignment to the
summer solstice sunrise, which

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
translates as the highest
position of the light

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:84%
during the year, which
translates as ancient wisdom.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So places like Luxor,
Stonehenge, Chartes Cathedral--

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.730 align:middle line:90%
always the northeast.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the most
important part of this site.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It's this boulder.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:11.603 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important thing.

00:45:11.603 --> 00:45:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very weird boulder.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.437 align:middle line:90%
It resembles a cosmic egg.

00:45:15.437 --> 00:45:17.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, I should point
out, first of all,

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.440 align:middle line:10%
that this site was
already very, very

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:10%
venerated for thousands of years
before the Templars showed up.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.272 align:middle line:10%
But they added their
own little appendages.

00:45:26.272 --> 00:45:27.730 align:middle line:10%
And they also appear
to have carved

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:32.340 align:middle line:10%
a symbol on the side of this
egg that resembles a womb.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.225 align:middle line:10%
And if you take a
closer look at it,

00:45:35.225 --> 00:45:36.850 align:middle line:10%
this womb is actually
very appropriate,

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:41.620 align:middle line:10%
because this site was the
focus of a cult of fertility.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And people who came
here, predominate

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.430 align:middle line:84%
the Celts and the
Visigoths, they always

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.668 align:middle line:84%
honored the cult of an Earth
goddess, a divine virgin.

00:45:50.668 --> 00:45:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So you see where
the connection goes.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were going where
this story already existed.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's unusual about
this big cosmic egg,

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:84%
this huge boulder, is that
right under it, beneath it,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is a curious chamber
containing arches.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.922 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed
to be a system,

00:46:06.922 --> 00:46:08.380 align:middle line:84%
according to the
official brochure,

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.470 align:middle line:84%
but any person that just
looks at it carefully,

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't even have to be a
geologist or a construction

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.930 align:middle line:84%
engineer will tell you that it
doesn't hold water very well.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So you have a group of knights
on top of a hill protecting it

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.940 align:middle line:84%
with a castle from invading
troops who built a hole that

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't hold water so they can
have water so they can drink.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't add up again.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're a dowser,
though, you will

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.060 align:middle line:84%
notice that the two
arches just happen

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to coincide with the path
of two of the Earth's

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.840 align:middle line:84%
telluric currents, and the cross
right under the boulder itself.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So again, someone's
telling you something

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.482 align:middle line:90%
about what goes on here.

00:46:44.482 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:84%
All of this is
totally out of place

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:84%
in a castle that's supposed
to be there for warcraft.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's totally consistent
with the Templar's doctrine

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of protecting sacred
spaces long associated

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
with the worship of
the divine feminine.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.460 align:middle line:90%
It gets better.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.080 align:middle line:10%
I suspect that that
chamber under it

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.842 align:middle line:10%
is actually a ritual chamber
where they could conduct

00:47:04.842 --> 00:47:06.550 align:middle line:10%
their ritual, because
all of these things

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.190 align:middle line:10%
were always done in dark caves.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:10%
The resurrection ritual
itself was always

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.940 align:middle line:10%
concerned with balance.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.060 align:middle line:10%
And typically, the
final initiation

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.188 align:middle line:10%
was performed at
the equinox sunrise,

00:47:18.188 --> 00:47:20.230 align:middle line:10%
because that's the moment
when light and dark are

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.430 align:middle line:10%
in complete balance.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Just like the two Templar
knights riding the one horse,

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:84%
light and dark has to
be in perfect balance.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.230 align:middle line:84%
A very clever person
on one of my tours

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:31.510 align:middle line:84%
pointed this out as
we were standing there

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.860 align:middle line:90%
at the equinox that--

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.780 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed how
the top of the rock

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.830 align:middle line:84%
has been artificially flattened,
and it's perfectly aligned

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.560 align:middle line:90%
to the Templar castle wall?

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about
it for a second.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to build a wall
to keep out foreign troops,

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.250 align:middle line:84%
why would you suddenly
bring the wall down

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to make it easier for the
troops to get over it?

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, you follow your
line, and look at what's

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.130 align:middle line:90%
happening in the horizon.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:84%
There's what appears to be a
natural or even artificially

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.220 align:middle line:84%
sculpted part of the
hill in the distance.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was not out of place
for people in the old days

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to artificially
sculpt the landscape

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.820 align:middle line:90%
to do a certain ritual.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the hole through which
the equinox sunrise appears,

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.640 align:middle line:84%
cuts through the wall, and
hits the top of the boulder.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.290 align:middle line:84%
If that wall had been the same
height all the way through,

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't have had that.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that there was
a deliberate referencing

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.910 align:middle line:84%
performed by the Templars even
though the site was really

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.090 align:middle line:90%
much older than they.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Then it gets really weird.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.090 align:middle line:84%
There's another second
church of the Templars

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:32.540 align:middle line:84%
built, this time dedicated to
John the Baptist, of course.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.680 align:middle line:90%
The two are never far apart.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And then there are all
these false sarcophagi.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I say false
sarcophagi because it's

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.800 align:middle line:84%
not unusual for
people back in that--

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.630 align:middle line:84%
actually, before the
time of the Templars

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:49.610 align:middle line:84%
in that part of the world
to hone out stone and make

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.770 align:middle line:90%
rock sarcophagi out of it.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Not unusual.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.670 align:middle line:84%
The problem with these is
that they're too shallow.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:10%
This one nearest to us is
only about three inches deep.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.620 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't seem to
serve any purpose.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.830 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't find any
evidence of cremation either.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.890 align:middle line:10%
So they are too shallow
to hold a body for burial,

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:10.670 align:middle line:10%
making them very impractical
as funerary boxes.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.340 align:middle line:10%
However, they are on
the summit, and they all

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.540 align:middle line:10%
face the sunrise, which is the
esoteric direction associated

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.160 align:middle line:10%
with the ritual resurrection.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:10%
There's a mirror to the story.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:10%
At the bottom of the
hill on the west side,

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:10%
this is what I do to
people on my tours.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:28.823 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:28.823 --> 00:49:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't
remember taking them out.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240 align:middle line:90%
They may still be there.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.672 align:middle line:90%
They'll be perfectly preserved.

00:49:41.672 --> 00:49:43.130 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of
the hill, you have

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:46.760 align:middle line:84%
sarcophagi which can hold
bodies, as you can see.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:90%
They're very deep.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.168 align:middle line:84%
And they're in the west,
which is usually the tradition

00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:90%
for going into the other world.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.100 align:middle line:84%
That's where you begin your
ritual or resurrection.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the fun part.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you have to carve
a huge amount of stone

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:84%
away from this enormous
boulder to achieve this effect.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of laborious work.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But a close look at the actual
periphery of these sarcophagi

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:10.110 align:middle line:84%
show that they're
very uneven steps.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to put a lid
on top of it, what would happen

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is that you would allow
enough space for rodents

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.960 align:middle line:90%
to come in and eat the body.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.830 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Why go through all that trouble
and watch snakes and rats go in

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:90%
and eat the body?

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.480 align:middle line:84%
However, it'll be
perfect for a person who

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is still breathing, needs air,
but doesn't need much light.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of the ritual.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a
theory that I have,

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.280 align:middle line:84%
but when you connect the two
sites and the two churches,

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:84%
they're all perfectly
mirroring each other.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship
between the stuff

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.840 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the hill in the
west, the traditional position

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.030 align:middle line:84%
of entering the other
world during a ritual,

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and the one's on top of the
hill that face the sunrise.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is all very consistent
also with Egyptian resurrection

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.470 align:middle line:84%
rituals, which, of course,
the candidates always

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:00.920 align:middle line:84%
enter the restricted
chamber in the west.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:84%
They started on the east bank of
the Nile that crossed the Nile.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They then entered the
temple through the west

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:06.890 align:middle line:90%
on the west bank.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
basically did their stuff

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.300 align:middle line:90%
under these special temples.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.650 align:middle line:84%
They got up on top of the
temple in the morning at dawn,

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were raised
from a figurative grave

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and taken to greet
the morning star

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Sirius or the equinox sunrise.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
earlier, Sirius, of course,

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is a star intimately
associated with divine wisdom.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.535 align:middle line:84%
Her more physical version
is, of course, Isis, Sophis.

00:51:32.535 --> 00:51:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
are all expressions

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of the original divine feminine,
which is also the Grail.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, one evidence-- god,
these things are good.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.112 align:middle line:90%
I've had some more.

00:51:47.112 --> 00:51:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to order
sushi next time.

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:50.932 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.932 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
One evidence of the
temples are following

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.400 align:middle line:84%
an Egyptian resurrection
ritual is actually

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.640 align:middle line:90%
the dimensions of these graves.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It never occurred
to me that being 6

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:90%
foot 5 can be very handy.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Terrible for buying clothes.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.667 align:middle line:84%
But the first time I ever
laid inside the sarcophagus

00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:12.000 align:middle line:84%
in the king's chamber-- where,
by the way, no one's ever

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:90%
have been found to be buried.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that, despite the
thinking that might not fit,

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:21.050 align:middle line:84%
it turned out to be a
perfect fit, eerily so.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the
width of my body,

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.240 align:middle line:84%
exactly the length from
the flat of my forehead

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to the flat of my feet.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.650 align:middle line:84%
That's how I know
the measurement.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.440 align:middle line:84%
When I lay down in one of these,
it's exactly the same width

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:90%
and length as well.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So whoever built this
had to have had knowledge

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of the earlier design as well.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's too coincidental
that these boxes

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.090 align:middle line:84%
on opposite sides of
the world are exactly

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.470 align:middle line:90%
the same length and width.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
other explanation.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Recent evidence now shows
that this sarcophagus

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:84%
in the king's chamber
apparently comes

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:90%
with a frequency of its own.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a frequency that's also
found in other chambers, which

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.820 align:middle line:84%
apparently around
Europe appear to have

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.690 align:middle line:84%
come with the same
tradition of resurrection.

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They're either called houses
of Osiris or houses of the bee.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The Hypogeum in
Malta is one of them.

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:13.280 align:middle line:84%
There are certain mounds
in Britain and Ireland

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.200 align:middle line:90%
which also are different shaped.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But all of them have
exactly the same frequency,

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency that this
box resonates out is 112 Hertz.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.117 align:middle line:90%
112 Hertz.

00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Not much was thought
about this, apart

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.700 align:middle line:84%
from the fact that you have
many chambers around the world,

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.820 align:middle line:84%
different in design, but all
sharing the same frequency

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:90%
range.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And it took a neurosurgeon
to look at this

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.620 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, wait a minute.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the frequency range--

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.610 align:middle line:84%
112 Hertz is about
the frequency range

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:44.250 align:middle line:84%
what switches the left brain
function to right brain.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a trigger.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And you think about
it for a second.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.190 align:middle line:84%
The one thing you did not want
to take with you when you're

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:84%
having an out of body experience
or having a ritual, or even

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.400 align:middle line:84%
a meditation, you don't want
to take your logical processing

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.228 align:middle line:90%
thought brain in there.

00:53:57.228 --> 00:53:58.520 align:middle line:90%
You want to be in a calm state.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.830 align:middle line:90%
You want to be meditating.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You want to switch
to right brain.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
connection suddenly

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.260 align:middle line:84%
begins to hint that these
places were built for something

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.270 align:middle line:90%
other than literal burial.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:09.710 align:middle line:84%
They were built
for a ritual that

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:13.400 align:middle line:84%
engages a person that is alive
to switch, to stop thinking

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and start thinking.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, and start feeling.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So there is an
implication there.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I want
to just point out

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:84%
this in this other
site in Portugal.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.610 align:middle line:90%
This is Sintra.

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:30.910 align:middle line:90%
It is that beautiful.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:90%
That is not Photoshop.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.433 align:middle line:90%
That is an actual photograph.

00:54:33.433 --> 00:54:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I was literally born at
the base of this hill,

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm beginning
to understand why.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.990 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of this hill
is the town of Sintra.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It's 40 miles west of
Lisbon in Portugal.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And it too was given
to the Templars

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
by the King of Portugal
under exceptional conditions.

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I mean exceptional
conditions.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It was given to the one guy--

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:53.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the five
guys who were sent

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.620 align:middle line:84%
on this clandestine mission
by the Templar master

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:84%
from Jerusalem to create
Portugal as a nation-state.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was given to him
while he's in absentia,

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.277 align:middle line:90%
he's actually in Jerusalem.

00:55:04.277 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It's as though he was expected
to come back and complete

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.055 align:middle line:90%
the task.

00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But there is
evidence that people

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:12.190 align:middle line:84%
were worshiping a divine
virgin on this hill

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:14.333 align:middle line:90%
as far back as 5,000 BC.

00:55:14.333 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was a place
that was also favored

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.460 align:middle line:90%
by hermits of all kinds.

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.365 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said
that, I want just

00:55:20.365 --> 00:55:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to remind you again
of Article Seven

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Rule of the Elected
Brothers of the Temple,

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:27.250 align:middle line:84%
because it was that
secret little book which

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.910 align:middle line:84%
was found in the possession
of this Templar master

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.660 align:middle line:84%
who was caught, unfortunately,
by the Inquisition.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And it said in rule seven,
"Build in your houses

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.170 align:middle line:84%
meeting places that
are large and hidden

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that can be accessed
by underground tunnels

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:84%
so that the brothers may go
to meetings without the risk

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.070 align:middle line:90%
of getting into trouble.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:46.900 align:middle line:84%
In the houses of the
unelected brothers,

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:50.170 align:middle line:84%
it is prohibited to conduct
certain materials pertaining

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to the philosophical sciences
or the transmutation of base

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.950 align:middle line:90%
metals into gold and silver.

00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:02.010 align:middle line:84%
This should only be undertaken
in secret and hidden places."

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Portugal is renowned
for earthquakes.

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And once in a while,
in 1970 for example,

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.985 align:middle line:90%
when I was a young nipper--

00:56:08.985 --> 00:56:10.490 align:middle line:84%
actually, before
I moved to Britain

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and concocted this
crazy accent--

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I was privy to one
of those earthquakes.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't lived till
you've been in the 6.9.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a good one.

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:22.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a meaty one.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they began to fix
up some of the buildings

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.450 align:middle line:90%
in central Sintra.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
underneath cafes and hotels.

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And they found a Hypogeum
or ritual chamber

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.180 align:middle line:84%
built by the Templars,
and it was absolutely

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.997 align:middle line:84%
packed with access tunnels five
levels below the town today.

00:56:38.997 --> 00:56:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was discovered
underneath a very good cafe.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.080 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.738 align:middle line:90%
What a coincidence.

00:56:45.738 --> 00:56:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Group, we're going to
stop here for coffee.

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:49.380 align:middle line:90%
No reason.

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And here's another
one of those tunnels.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:55.000 align:middle line:84%
When you consider
that this is granite,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.810 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty laborious.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of hard work.

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This particular tunnel has
a connecting passageway

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that leads one way
to the nearby Templar

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:84%
palace in the middle
of Sintra town square.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And another goes all the way
uphill for about 300 meters

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to the castle that the Templars
rebuilt. And 15 minutes

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:17.140 align:middle line:84%
walk away from these tunnels,
under all of these Templar

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.170 align:middle line:90%
buildings--

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:20.440 align:middle line:84%
By the way, all the
buildings are still there.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They've just been remodeled
into modern businesses.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So the whole of
Sintra was a big area

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of Templar veneration, a
place where they conducted,

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.240 align:middle line:90%
obviously, secret ritual.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.970 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes walk is a
property which defies belief.

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:35.770 align:middle line:90%
[GASPING]

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that pretty
much explains it.

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:42.250 align:middle line:84%
This was actually rebuilt
in the modern era at the--

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.530 align:middle line:84%
it was about 1904
that this stuff

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.030 align:middle line:90%
was added to this property.

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But in 1371, this
property was still

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.300 align:middle line:84%
in the possession of
the Knights Templar.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And back then, it was
called the Forest of Angels.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:59.370 align:middle line:84%
It was part of an ancient right
of way, arranged passageway,

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that connected various sacred
sites like a pilgrimage route.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.030 align:middle line:90%
There are sacred springs.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, the Templars,
owned the property right

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in the very beginning
which associated

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.560 align:middle line:84%
with certain rites
of the mysteries,

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.400 align:middle line:84%
pilgrimage, and also places
that allowed for a certain state

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.530 align:middle line:90%
of mind to take place.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, as you can
see, it is a site

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.130 align:middle line:84%
of an extensive property owned
by successive Masonic families.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So in a matter of speaking,
the Templars sold the property

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:31.687 align:middle line:84%
to the Freemasons, and he kept
it in the family, so to speak.

00:58:31.687 --> 00:58:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Show us some more
pictures of these gardens.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.460 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you know
your symbolism, you

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:37.210 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what
it's telling you.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you because,
well, we'd be here all day.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The gardens can only be
described as a deliberately

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.450 align:middle line:90%
designed ritual landscape.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It is full of mythical
figures, esoteric symbols,

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:52.510 align:middle line:84%
packed with sacred
geometry, observatories

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.540 align:middle line:84%
for watching the stars,
all symbols pertaining

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to the mysteries teachings.

00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
it was designed

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:00.460 align:middle line:90%
as an outdoor classroom.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't exclusive
to the Masons,

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.698 align:middle line:84%
because when the man that
took over this property

00:59:05.698 --> 00:59:07.240 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the 20th century,

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.580 align:middle line:84%
he then opened it to
the public as well

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to ask the curious to
start inquiring about what

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.517 align:middle line:90%
these things about.

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the Masons
said, well, come with me

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.010 align:middle line:90%
little boy, little girl.

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they would indoctrinate
you to the lesser mysteries.

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you're curious
and you are responsible,

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.690 align:middle line:84%
they would bring you into
the inner brotherhood.

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know where
that story goes.

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
highlight of this trip.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:32.480 align:middle line:84%
The greatest wonder
is the labyrinth

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of tunnels dug into the solid
bedrock of the mountainside.

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And they penetrate
deep into the hill

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:42.110 align:middle line:84%
as though meant for initiates
who wish to immerse themselves

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.680 align:middle line:84%
in total dark seclusion of
the womb of the Earth mother.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Total sensory deprivation.

00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are
absolutely pitch black.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Take a torch.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They also bear an uncanny
resemblance to the tunnels

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.940 align:middle line:84%
dug by the Templars in
Ethiopia, and specifically

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the Templars from Portugal who
had an obsession with Ethiopia,

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:03.860 align:middle line:90%
in the 12th century.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And these two join a
number of churches that

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:08.666 align:middle line:90%
are cut out of living rock.

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Show you a few more pictures.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:10.730 align:middle line:90%
There's not many.

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:15.427 align:middle line:84%
There's only a couple of
them that are actually lit.

01:00:15.427 --> 01:00:16.760 align:middle line:90%
All of them are completely dark.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They literally are a
perfect environment meant

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:20.390 align:middle line:90%
for a shamanic journeying.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:23.030 align:middle line:84%
If you want to spend a day,
and if you go off season,

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:24.980 align:middle line:84%
you can really have
this place to yourself.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful place to go.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a
nearby cafe as well.

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Actually, there's five of them.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.740 align:middle line:90%
And they go on and on and on.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are now
blocked by debris.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Arabs said,
before the Templar showed up,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%
the mountain is actually hollow.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of the hill of
Sintra is hollow.

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the ocean
coming under the mountain

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.530 align:middle line:90%
at high tide.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of bad
earthquakes that happen here.

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So some of these tunnels
are now choked by debris,

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
but a couple of them are lit
for the benefit of tourism.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
story gets very exciting,

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
because one of these tunnels
leads to a shaft sunk

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.360 align:middle line:90%
40 feet into the Earth.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And here it is from above.

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, now, why
would an idiot put this there?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.715 align:middle line:84%
And before the lawyers came
around and put this metal ring

01:01:10.715 --> 01:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
around it, you could
just walk in there

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night and go, oh.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you would
not be resurrected.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
official brochures

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.410 align:middle line:90%
describe this as a well.

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But any close
examination of the shaft

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
shows that it clearly
never did, nor is it

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
capable of holding a drop
of water, most of all

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
because it has a
shaft leading to it,

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and the shaft goes downhill,
and the water goes out.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.010 align:middle line:90%
It is an 18 foot diameter hole.

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.135 align:middle line:84%
It is surrounded by
a rough, dry stone

01:01:39.135 --> 01:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
wall in the shape of
a horseshoe, which

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
appears to be much older
than its surroundings.

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the entrance, for
the people who are curious,

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.620 align:middle line:84%
of all the compass
directions, it

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
points exactly to the
northeast, and aligns perfectly

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
with the summer
solstice sunrise.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So the entrance to the shaft
is referencing the highest

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
position of the light
in the solar calendar,

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
which in esoteric terms
equates to ancient wisdom.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, that day also
just happens to coincide

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
with the feast day of the
Templar's greatest hero,

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:10.670 align:middle line:90%
John the Baptist.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.271 align:middle line:84%
You can see how these things
just fall into your lap.

01:02:16.271 --> 01:02:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's a view down the shaft.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This shaft consist
of five levels

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
of unevenly stacked
and undressed

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
limestone blocks, here and
there patched and repaired.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And behind these
blocks, they hide

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:30.650 align:middle line:90%
five narrow circular galleries.

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them is accessed
through really claustrophobic

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
spiral stairs set
into a rough wall,

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and all in a measured
style that suggests

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
a later refurbishment,
again, possibly due

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
to the earthquake activity.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But they certainly did not
make this easy for you.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It was not a day-- a
picnic in the park.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
You actually went
for a certain trial,

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
almost as though you're required
to walk through these spiral

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.480 align:middle line:90%
staircase in humility.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
You bent down all the
time, even short people.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Here we are at the bottom.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Here we have what basically is
a well that does not hold water.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It has an entrance that faces
the sun whose light cannot

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:09.890 align:middle line:90%
penetrate down the shaft.

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So it clearly serves
no practical purpose.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So we are left
with a possibility

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.323 align:middle line:84%
to consider it was used
for a ritual purpose.

01:03:19.323 --> 01:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of
this shaft, there

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
is another underground
passage, and it

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
leads to a second well of
a very different nature.

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful place.

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:30.980 align:middle line:90%


01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Architecturally, it's much more
advanced, and it's in a style

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
common to the time
of the Templars.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
closely, it does show

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that it has been
refurbished at the beginning

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.730 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So something's been added to it
again because it's built also

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in the Revivalist style common
to that period, which just

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the
same Revivalist

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
period common to the
time of the 12th century.

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So here's a story
behind his property.

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It was inherited in the
19th century by a Freemason.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
The property was in complete
disrepair at the time

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
because Portugal was going
through some pretty hard times.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was bought at an
auction by a man called

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Carvalho Monteiro, which
may not mean anything

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
to you unless you're
Portuguese and your curious.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Because Carvalho Monterio almost
sounds like an invented name.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.170 align:middle line:84%
It means "the oak tree
on top of a mound."

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a druidic name
if I ever heard of one.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got the mound, and
you've got the oak on top of it.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.550 align:middle line:90%
It's druidic symbolism.

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So whether it was a real
name or an invented one,

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
the fact is that this man
was a 33rd degree Mason,

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.243 align:middle line:84%
and his symbols are
all over the place.

01:04:36.243 --> 01:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
What he did was
with his property,

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
he rebuilt the entire site,
put his entire family fortune

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
into it.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Total dedication to his craft.

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And he also extensively
added to the property

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
in the Revivalist
style of his period.

01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
There are extensive works
throughout property.

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them, and I
mean every one of them--

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking at least
100 pieces of works,

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
from statues to
buildings-- are all

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
accounted for in the
architect's blueprints.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.100 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I've gone through all of them.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There is no record
of either shaft.

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think, stuff
of this magnitude

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
would have required bills
of sale, pickaxes, dynamite,

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.080 align:middle line:90%
workmen, horses.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
There is not one
shred of evidence

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
that this person actually
built these shafts.

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
He may have refurbished
them, but it clearly

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
shows that the shafts were
already on the property

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
long before the Masons arrived,
and certainly were there when

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:29.190 align:middle line:90%
the Templars arrived as well.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.750 align:middle line:84%
The entrance to
the shaft is hidden

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.315 align:middle line:90%
inside a neolithic dolmen.

01:05:33.315 --> 01:05:34.440 align:middle line:90%
How's that for an instance?

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.982 align:middle line:84%
You walk past it,
you think, oh, it's

01:05:35.982 --> 01:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
just a-- it looks like
a neolithic dolmen.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
The capstone is
hidden by the moss.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually
look closely and you

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
go through this little gap,
there's actually a huge stone.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.907 align:middle line:84%
And you go like this, and
you think, oh, there's

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:49.740 align:middle line:90%
something behind it.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.493 align:middle line:84%
Because you knock
it, it's hollow.

01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you just push
it in the right moment,

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
it pivots, just like
"Indiana Jones."

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And you walk in, and
you go down the shaft.

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The connection--
it's very theatrical,

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
but there's a
connection to this,

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.107 align:middle line:84%
because the original dolmen
throughout the world also,

01:06:05.107 --> 01:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
most of them, were actually
used for shamanic journeying

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.702 align:middle line:84%
as well, specifically the ones
that are aligned east-west.

01:06:10.702 --> 01:06:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And now you know why
they're aligned east-west.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.672 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
ritual direction.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
There is also this beautiful
chapel, which definitely

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
was built during his time.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a gorgeous building.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But the best part of
it is on the side,

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.542 align:middle line:84%
because people walk by
this and they go, ah!.

01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Without realizing what
they're looking at

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most important
symbols of the Templar world.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
If you can remember how during
the official confirmation

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in Troy in 1128, Bernard
of Clairvaux specifically

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
stated how the
Templars must follow

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the obedience of Bethany, the
castle of Mary and Martha--

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that is, obedience to the line
of Mary of Bethany or Mary

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing here
is the emblem of that vow.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
You have the two
castles, and they're

01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
sitting on top of the green
man, the rejuvenating,

01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:02.033 align:middle line:90%
resurrected god of nature.

01:07:02.033 --> 01:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's showing
that the practices

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
were still alive and well
long after the Templars went

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.060 align:middle line:90%
underground.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They were resumed again in the
20th century, still probably

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:12.778 align:middle line:84%
being done so today
quietly in the background.

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But it does clearly
show that there's

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
this continuation
of nature worship

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
with this resurrected
god hero that you

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
find throughout Templar and
also early Christian history.

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I told you it
was going to be heavy work.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
One aspect of temple making
that I've come across

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
during my research
on how temples

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.070 align:middle line:90%
are aligned to each other--

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at temple
history throughout the world

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and how they seem to coincide
with the same building

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
period or the same
function, they all

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
appear to be aligned to each
other in perfect triangles.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I found this in the
Andes, in India, in China,

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, every single
time without exception.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars apparently were
doing exactly the same thing,

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
because if you take
the center of Thamara

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and that alter, the
rotunda, and you

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
put a pin on the altar of
Monsanto where that egg was,

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.445 align:middle line:84%
and then you go to the Forest
of Angels, it's a perfect--

01:08:05.445 --> 01:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and I mean exactly perfect
isosceles triangle yet again.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.010 align:middle line:10%
So they were following
the same tradition

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:14.900 align:middle line:10%
of temple making and
temple alignment that

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.453 align:middle line:10%
was pursued by people way
before their / it was part

01:08:18.453 --> 01:08:20.370 align:middle line:10%
of a long lineage of
people who were following

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:21.583 align:middle line:10%
ancient mysteries.

01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:23.250 align:middle line:10%
And the geometric
alignment doesn't even

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:25.920 align:middle line:10%
stop there, because later when
the order was extinguished

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.340 align:middle line:10%
by the Church, allegedly,
the Templars of Portugal

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.990 align:middle line:10%
kept on going.

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.970 align:middle line:10%
They just changed their name.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:34.890 align:middle line:10%
The biggest joke in history.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:39.000 align:middle line:10%
The King of Portugal, who was
secretly a Templar grandmaster,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.859 align:middle line:10%
writes to the Pope
and says, oh, we've

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.810 align:middle line:10%
extinguished the Order
of the Knights Templar,

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:45.243 align:middle line:10%
but coincidentally,
yesterday there

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:47.160 align:middle line:10%
was a new order that
appeared called the Order

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.202 align:middle line:10%
of the Knights of Christ.

01:08:48.202 --> 01:08:49.380 align:middle line:90%
What a strange thing.

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.010 align:middle line:84%
We lose one order,
we gain the other.

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:52.240 align:middle line:90%
It's same guys.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Pope bought it
hook, line, and sinker.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The biggest practical
joke in history.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And they went on
practicing together.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They were now
practicing and working

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
with the other Templars that ran
away to Rosslyn, to Scotland.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.149 align:middle line:84%
And you know the story
behind that, I'm sure.

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:07.830 align:middle line:10%
Well it turns out
that when you actually

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:11.310 align:middle line:10%
connect these further dots,
you put Thamara and Rosslyn

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:14.310 align:middle line:10%
and you go back to the origin
of the story on Mount Zion,

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:16.680 align:middle line:10%
you've got a perfect
triangle yet again.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.779 align:middle line:10%
But what happens when
you bisect that triangle

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:24.270 align:middle line:10%
by the number of nature, the
golden mean, the golden ratio?

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.069 align:middle line:10%
You bisect the
triangle, and it hits

01:09:26.069 --> 01:09:28.392 align:middle line:10%
exactly this big
pinnacle of rock

01:09:28.392 --> 01:09:29.850 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
Switzerland called

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:34.100 align:middle line:10%
Sion, where another secretive
organization related

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.729 align:middle line:10%
to the original
order of the temple--

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:40.490 align:middle line:10%
to the order of monks in Sion
and Jerusalem exists today.

01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.020 align:middle line:10%
And having made
several inquiries

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.479 align:middle line:10%
as to what they're doing
there and who they are,

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.220 align:middle line:10%
the doors closed very quickly.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.529 align:middle line:84%
And it tells me I'm on
the right path of inquiry.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:50.450 align:middle line:90%
That could be another thing.

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:52.399 align:middle line:84%
There's another book's
in there somewhere.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought the coincidence
is extraordinary.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.660 align:middle line:10%
But if you're very
curious and you

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.480 align:middle line:10%
follow that bisection line all
the way across the Atlantic,

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.190 align:middle line:10%
would you believe it
ends up in Newfoundland

01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:08.240 align:middle line:10%
and right in the heart
of a town that was--

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.840 align:middle line:10%
a new town that was built in
honor of John the Baptist,

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.530 align:middle line:10%
St. John's, Newfoundland.

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:18.290 align:middle line:10%
Keep following the line, and
end up in your own country

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:20.420 align:middle line:10%
and see what happens.

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave that for you
to think about for a second.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very curious.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So was this what the King
of Portugal had in mind

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
all along when he
designed the seal

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
on the charter for the land
where the Templars created

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.500 align:middle line:90%
a kingdom within a kingdom?

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.920 align:middle line:10%
If you remember, that
other unusual meaning

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.890 align:middle line:10%
for the name of the town
Thamara in Portuguese

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:47.030 align:middle line:10%
is "to drink," which is a very
unusual name to give a town.

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.350 align:middle line:10%
Because like all secret
symbols, drinking

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.420 align:middle line:10%
marks the beginning
of the journey

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.580 align:middle line:10%
into the mysteries,
when the initiate is

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.730 align:middle line:10%
said to drink of the
knowledge of the mysteries.

01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:01.850 align:middle line:10%
We just happen to know this
metaphor by another name.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It is the cup of
everlasting life.

01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you drink
this knowledge,

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
you are essentially
following in the footsteps

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of a bloodline of seers,
of mystics, of alchemists

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
all of whom honor
a deity from whom

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.960 align:middle line:90%
it is said all wisdom emanates.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
This deity, this
source of wisdom,

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
is always portrayed
as a divine virgin.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And through the ages, she
has taken on many guises.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
She has been called Isis.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.850 align:middle line:10%
She has been known as the
Magdal-eder, or the Magdalene

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:34.160 align:middle line:10%
as we call her,
the divine virgin

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.640 align:middle line:10%
to whom the Templars erected
a disproportionate amount

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.080 align:middle line:10%
of churches.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention the
gothic cathedrals

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
as well that still bear her
medieval name, Notre Dame.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And one building in particular
where the masculine is married

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to the divine bride,
and that is this place,

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
the rotunda of
Thamara, that salver,

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
that tray upon which
the Grail rests.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.660 align:middle line:10%
It is built in the center
of a Templar kingdom

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.240 align:middle line:10%
inside Europe's
first nation-state,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.250 align:middle line:10%
a sacred land
created from scratch

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:08.060 align:middle line:10%
by a group of dedicated
knights solely for the purpose

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:11.810 align:middle line:10%
of finding that most elusive of
all quests in the 12th century

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:14.330 align:middle line:10%
and today, the quest
for enlightenment

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.610 align:middle line:10%
and personal empowerment.

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Templars
900-year secret.

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
It is their greatest
accomplishments,

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and the one story that's never
been told, incredibly enough.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you wish to follow the
rest of this original tale,

01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:29.630 align:middle line:90%
have I got a book for you.

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:31.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for
putting up with this.

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.790 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:53.611 align:middle line:90%
