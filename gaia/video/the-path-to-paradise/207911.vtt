>> To discover the true
meaning behind any subject,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:84%
it is sometimes necessary to
unlearn what has been taught.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Take the concept of
paradise, for example.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
While Eastern traditions equate
paradise with the higher ideal,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Western traditions
view it as a pure land

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
tainted by evil, reserved
for the virtuous,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%
and accessible only to the dead.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
But this view is based
on errors in translation

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
from older sources,
further distorted

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
through religious
motives and then

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
through unquestioned repetition,
accepted over time as dogma

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
despite it bearing
little resemblance

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:90%
with the original teachings.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.665 align:middle line:84%
So what is paradise
really about?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:10%
Antiquarians such
as John Michell

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:10%
summed up paradise as
a kind of life mission

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:10%
whose aim is the
attainment of philosophical

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:10%
as well as biological
perfection.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And to quote Michell, "just
as the forms of nature,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
such as the rose, the
crystal, and so on

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
reflect an ideal symmetry,
which no individual among them

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:84%
ever achieves, so it
is with humanity."

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
In deriving all
the forms of nature

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
from ideal and
manifest prototypes,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
traditional philosophy reverses
the evolutionist's notion

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
of human assent
from lower creatures

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and inculcates the
opposite myth that we

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:84%
are descendants from
a divine creation

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and may properly aspire to
re-enter the primeval paradise.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
If so, how do perfection
and paradise overlap?

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it really a state that can
be experienced when one is still

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:90%
in this world?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And if paradise is more
than an imaginary realm,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:90%
how and where can it be reached?

Our quest begins with
the most unlikeliest

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:90%
of topics, the Knights Templar.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 12th
century, recruits

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
wishing to join
the Templar Order

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
made a vow to discover
the joys of paradise.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
It seems odd that military
men and mercenaries

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
with big swords, people who
engage in war for a living,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
should make such a
preposterous statement.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Or was there something
more to the Templars

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
that meets the eye, a
spiritual angle perhaps?

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It is known that the inner
brotherhood of the Templars

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
behave more like an ecumenical
college than an elite fighting

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:90%
outfit.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:10%
And they also conducted
a secret ritual

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:10%
that culminated in a
mystical revelation.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And a hint of what
this entailed came

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:10%
to light in the 14th century.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:10%
After the Templars
escaped persecution,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:10%
they moved to
Portugal and Scotland.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:10%
And following a secret ritual on
the summit of a sacred mountain

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:10%
on the spring equinox,
they changed their name

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:10%
to Scottish Rite Freemasonry.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:10%
So in a matter of
speaking, the Templars

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:10%
were one of the
first organizations

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:10%
to successfully employ brand
marketing and public relations.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But it enabled the practices
to remain untouched.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So in the Masonic third degree,
for example, the candidate

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
is lifted from a
figurative grave.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They're pronounced
risen from the dead.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And then his or her
blindfold is removed.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Because having been exposed
to restricted knowledge,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:10%
they became enlightened.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:10%
And the third degree
itself was symbolic

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:10%
of an actual ritual
that was performed

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:10%
in a restricted underground
chamber in which the candidate

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:10%
undertook an induced
out-of-body experience.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, the initiates who
successfully completed

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:10%
the ritual claimed that they
had experienced paradise

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:10%
and were therefore free
from fear of physical death.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:10%
And it gave them a
completely different view

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.782 align:middle line:10%
of how the universe really is
rather than how it appears.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, to add to this, there's
the Masonic 17th degree.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's said to be the most
spiritual of all the teachings

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:10%
because it paves the
way to understanding

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:10%
the laws of nature and
establishing a relationship

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:10%

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, clearly such concepts
didn't just appear overnight.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:10%
They are the sum
of hundreds, if not

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:10%
thousands, of years of
acquiring specialist

information and, of course,
personal experience.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:10%

is just how old is

and the Scottish Rite Masons

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:10%

The collective
teachings are known

as The Way of Ise, an
odd title because it

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%

as well as for raising
the latent spirituality

called the Osirion.

They would walk up
a short staircase.

fundamental principle of how

language of the temple

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
was taken north to Ireland
where a group of mystics

built the massive double

at the spring equinox sunset.

inside the inner chamber
to access a paradisial land

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
stands a limestone butte
carved inside and out

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.543 align:middle line:84%
with unusual alcoves, and
symbols, and staircases.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And all these
things lead nowhere.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:10%
But inside, there's a
chamber resembling a womb.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Prior to entering this
hand-carved chamber,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the initiate arrived in
a preparatory courtyard

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by 17
niches and each one

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
said to contain a
restricted teaching.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they entered
the restricted chamber

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
to undertake an out-of-body
experience that took them

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.685 align:middle line:84%
to a land beyond our world from
which they return perfected

00:10:58.685 --> 00:10:59.485 align:middle line:90%
three days later.

00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Such examples build a
picture of people involved

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
in search of the
paradisial environment

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
from which they return
very different from when

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:90%
they departed.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's the difference.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
They experience
paradise while alive

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.033 align:middle line:84%
and return to this
world to carry on

00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:23.075 align:middle line:90%
with their daily affairs.

00:11:23.075 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:10%
To get a better sense
of what was going on,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:10%
let's add another layer to
the story, the original story

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:10%
of two people who lived
in one of paradises

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:10%
original earthly
counterparts This was Adamah

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:10%
and Havah, otherwise known in
the Western tradition as Adam

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:10%
and Eve.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
In the Hebrew
version of the story,

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
these two hapless
antediluvian people

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
are booted out of paradise
and its blissful state.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
However, in the once
banned agnostic tradition,

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:84%
which is far closer to the
original Sumerian account which

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
itself was copied from an
even more ancient text,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.000 align:middle line:84%
things turned out very different
when Eve was plucking the apple

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:90%
from the tree.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:10%
The serpent in this version
is a benevolent hero,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:10%
while the god
portrayed in the story

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:10%
is not a pleasant
individual at all.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:10%
He's very jealous.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:10%
He's a shadow god.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And we see this when
the serpent asks

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Eve what did God say to you?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Was it to not eat from
the tree of knowledge?

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And Eve replies, he said,
not only do not eat from it

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
but do not touch
it lest you die.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent reassures
Eve and she says to her,

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
do not be afraid.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
With death, you shall not die
for it was out of jealousy

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
that he said this to you.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Rather your eyes
shall open and you

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
shall come to be like gods
recognizing evil and good.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough,
once she and her Adam

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:10%
ate from the tree
of knowledge, they

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:10%
experienced enlightenment
because the knowledge empowered

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:10%
them to reach spiritual
transfiguration and all

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:10%
of this while
living in paradise.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And since the original meaning
of paradise is a fertile plain

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by water, clearly
this was a real location.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
However, the name
carries a double meaning.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:10%
The fertile plain
referred to is a metaphor

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:10%
of the island of wisdom that
rises above the waters of chaos

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:10%
like a belly pregnant with the
sum of all information placed

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:10%
there by the gods.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:10%
So in metaphysical
terms, this paradise

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:10%
illustrates an
environment or dimension

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:10%
where one is able to access
knowledge at its purest level.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:10%
A talking serpent should
raise anybody's suspicion.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And, indeed, it is the
key to understanding

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:10%
the story of paradise.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:10%
The serpent was,
in fact, a woman,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:10%
and her name was Taba'et.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
She was the wife of a
god man called Enki.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And they belong to a group of
sages, keepers of knowledge.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:10%
And since they understood and
controlled the laws of nature,

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:10%
they became associated with
the rhythm and flow of energy

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.200 align:middle line:10%
which flows like an
invisible serpent.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.360 align:middle line:10%
And hence they're given
title, people of the serpent.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, the story of
Adamah and Havah in paradise

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:10%
describes the self-empowerment
of the individual

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:10%
for the understanding
of the laws of nature.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Much more so than a tale
of chastisement and sin.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So far, it appears that
interacting with the state

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
or place called
Paradise enables access

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to specialized information,
spiritual truths,

even the understanding
of celestial mechanics.

himself who describes

Plato spent 13 years
in Egypt, long enough

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to be acquainted with
the mystical practices

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:90%
of its temples.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And he points out that
the aim of the seeker

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:10%
is to become conscious
of the wisdom found only

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:10%
in this out-of-body
reality while still living.

again, true philosophers

as one of the highest stages
of personal enlightenment.

To which he added, the shoe
occupation of the philosopher

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:10%
is to allow the soul to
be released from the body

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:10%
and run free.

Which apparently, he did.

of a paradisial state

Another writer offering
a candid description

of his experience in
a paradisial dimension

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
is the second century
writer, Lucius Apuleius.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, the high priest
ordered all uninitiated persons

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to depart.

into the inner recesses
of the sanctuary itself.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I approached the
very gates of death

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and set one foot on
Persephone's threshold.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I journeyed through
all of the elements

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and yet was permitted to return.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%

shining as if it were noon.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%

up his experience

into the paradisial
landscape as reborn

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:10%
and brought back on the
road of a new blessing.

But one of its earliest

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
In 1470 BC, Thutmose
III allegedly

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
had this beautiful underground
chamber made for his burial.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:10%
But there are problems
with the story.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:10%
First, the tomb contains a well.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Now a dead pharaoh would
hardly have stepped out

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:10%
of his sarcophagus
and walked upstairs

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:10%
to take a sip of water.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:10%
Secondly, his chamber
faces the Northeast,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:10%
which is traditionally
the direction associated

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:10%
with the acquisition
of ancient wisdom.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:10%
Again, redundant
because if you are

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:10%
dead you already have access
to all the knowledge you want.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And finally, and most
suspicious of all,

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Thutmose was buried
on the other side

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain in the
Temple of Hatshepsut,

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
where he had already built
himself a mortuary temple.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:10%
So we have to ask
ourselves, why does

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:10%
one man need two places
in which to bury himself?

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:10%
None of this makes
any sense, and we

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:10%
need a better explanation.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Look carefully and the
answer is all around you.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:10%
The so-called tomb is
wrapped with a text

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:10%
called "The Book of
the Hidden Chamber"

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:10%
which describes
in intimate detail

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptian
underworld, the Amduat,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:10%
how to get there,
and more importantly,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:10%
the techniques to help
your soul concentrate

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:10%
and then return to
your living body.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's exemplified in
the following passage:

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:10%
it is good for the dead
to have this knowledge,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:10%
but also for the
person on Earth.

these mysterious images

after he was favored to join
the pharaoh's inner circle

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:10%
via a secret ritual.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:10%
And the servant
describes his surprise

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:10%
upon being admitted to master's
secret things of the pharaoh.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:10%
And this humble man writes,
"today in the presence of Teti,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:10%
son of Ra, more honored by
the pharaoh than any servant

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:10%
as master of secret
things of every work which

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:10%
his majesty does.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
When his majesty
favored me he caused it.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I entered the chamber
of restricted access."

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:10%
And of course this man stays
silent about the actual event.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:10%
But at the end the grateful
servant joyfully proclaims,

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:10%
"I found the way."

been privy to the same teaching

the old self the body

vessel with greater ease.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:10%
We have help on this topic
from the Gnostic Gospels

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:10%
who go a step further.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:10%
They describe how an
organization built temples

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:10%
as a representation of
the spiritual places

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:10%
in the landscape.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
created an antidote

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:84%
against forces of darkness that
steered people who follow them

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
into great trouble, leading them
astray with many deceptions.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And they died not
having found the truth,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and thus they became
enslaved forever

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
from the foundations
of the world.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:10%
Now that's some benefit
and hardly surprising

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:10%
considering the
ancients knew they

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:10%
inhabited a universe
where everything is alive,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:10%
even the rocks.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:10%
So consequently the
temples that they built

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:10%
consist of the numbers,
the proportions,

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:10%
that form the very
fabric of the cosmos.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:10%
So the number and proportion in
every stone, pillar, entrance,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:10%
staircase, or room are designed
to reflect celestial mechanics.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.300 align:middle line:10%
And the point was to open a
gap in the fabric of space

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:10%
and time, and allow
a person to engage

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.815 align:middle line:10%
with the heart of the universe.

00:30:34.815 --> 00:30:38.202 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:38.202 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:84%
A practical example
of this is Stonehenge.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The megaliths not only
defined the boundary

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
between profane and sacred
space, but the gaps in between

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:90%
act as windows into paradise.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:10%
Because they mark the flow
into the Temple of water

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:10%
below the ground, that is by
nature already electrically

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.070 align:middle line:10%
charged, in addition to telluric
currents that are attracted

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.375 align:middle line:10%
to the center of the site.

00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Crossing these windows,
the human body's

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
field is stimulated,

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's state of
awareness altered.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.455 align:middle line:84%
In a manner of speaking,
they are entering paradise.

00:31:25.455 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.720 align:middle line:84%
This relationship between
strategically guided

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
energy and temples
as passageways

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.880 align:middle line:84%
into a parallel
reality is described

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:90%
in the temples themselves.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:10%
One temple in Edfu describes
how a protective zone

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:10%
was established
around the perimeter

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:10%
of the mansions of the gods.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:10%
So what would the
architects referring to?

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Were they employing bouncers
to keep the undeserving away?

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out
that the recent study

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:10%
shows how it is known
that the Earth is

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.250 align:middle line:10%
encircled with an
electromagnetic net called

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:10%
the Hartmann grid.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.560 align:middle line:10%
And readings taken at
sacred sites from Europe

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.930 align:middle line:10%
all the way to
Tibet found this net

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:10%
to be stretched into bands
of 18 geomagnetic lines

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:10%
around the temples,
in effect behaving

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.980 align:middle line:10%
like a protective membrane.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And places like Saqqara,
and Karnak, Luxor,

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:10%
even the stupas of Tibet
enjoy an immense neutral zone

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:10%
that allows energy
inside the perimeter

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.290 align:middle line:10%
of these domains of
the gods to facilitate

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:10%
a higher state of awareness.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:10%
In another study, a
magnetometer survey

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:10%
of the Rollright stone
circle in England

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:10%
shows how one telluric
current is drawn like a spiral

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.220 align:middle line:10%
into the circle of stones.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.610 align:middle line:10%
And the intensity of
the geomagnetic field

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.810 align:middle line:10%
within the circle was also
found to be significantly lower

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:10%
than the outside.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So the stones behave
like a shield.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it has been
discovered that the ditches

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
around the stone circles
conduct telluric ground current.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
They concentrate it and then
release it via the entrance

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and often at double the
rate the surrounding land.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Inside the world's largest
stone circle at Avebury,

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
magnetic readings drop at
night to a far greater level

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.930 align:middle line:84%
that can be accounted for
under normal circumstances.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And at sunrise they charge
back with the ground current

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:84%
from the surrounding land
attracted to the ditch

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:84%
just as magnetic fluctuations
inside the stone circle

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:90%
begin to reach their maximum.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.949 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:10%
The Sioux of North America
refer to this energy as skan.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
And where it concentrates it
leads to spiritual attuning.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:10%
So that contact with
many places of power

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.234 align:middle line:10%
builds up a numinous
state of mind.

00:34:21.234 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Such anomalies in the
local electromagnetic grid

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
reveal why temples were seen
as living beings that sleep

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.190 align:middle line:90%
at night and awaken at dawn.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Another example of a
temple forming a boundary

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:90%
into paradise is Saqqara.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.489 align:middle line:84%
Inside one of its
adjacent pyramids

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:48.070 align:middle line:84%
there exist a set of
explicit instructions

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:90%
for accessing the other world.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And includes the
following passage,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:84%
seven degrees of
perfection enable passage

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.250 align:middle line:90%
from Earth to heaven.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:10%
It's as though the phrase
alludes to a threshold that

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:09.150 align:middle line:10%
needs to be crossed from the
physical into the non-physical,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:10%
which of course, is
an apt description

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:10%
of the purpose of the temple.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:10%
But why should this require
seven degrees of perfection?

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:10%
Does the visitor undergo
a kind of purification

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:10%
before entering this site?

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Egyptian mythology,
the passage into paradise

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is made through Sekhet-Aaru,
the field of reeds.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:10%
And to reach this
much desired land one

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:10%
must first pass through
a series of gates.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:10%
And at Saqqara, one has to
do just that before entering

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.380 align:middle line:10%
the mansion of the gods.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:90%
It is a unique passageway.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:84%
A column made of
reeds, each bundle

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:90%
separated by narrow alcoves.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:10%
And each alcove discharges an
alternating field of positive

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:10%
and negatively
charged energy that

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:10%
serves as an invisible
gate while at the same time

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:06.030 align:middle line:10%
influencing the electromagnetic
circuits of a person walking

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.010 align:middle line:10%
into the main compound.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it is
a preparatory hallway.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:90%
But to what end?

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:18.390 align:middle line:10%
Well, since the temple is a
perfect mirror of creation,

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:10%
anyone who enters the site with
negative thoughts or emotions

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:10%
is considered a liability
to this perfect environment.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.160 align:middle line:10%
So to protect the
temple, one must

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:10%
be mindful before entering
the sacred domain.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:10%
And the pyramid
texts refer to this

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:10%
as mastering the
self before crossing

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:10%
the threshold of each gate.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:10%
It seems that each alternating
charge along the passageway

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.580 align:middle line:10%
is helping you dispel
negative emotions.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there
exists seven positive charges

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.440 align:middle line:84%
appears to explain those seven
degrees of perfection mentioned

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.846 align:middle line:90%
in the text.

00:36:59.846 --> 00:37:03.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.270 align:middle line:90%


00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The idea of seven protective
gates is not unique to Saqqara.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:10%
In Ireland, the upright
stones forming the passageway

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:10%
of Newgrange are arranged
so that their magnetic poles

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.865 align:middle line:10%
generate exactly seven
positive charges either side

00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:21.665 align:middle line:10%
of the passage.

00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:84%
This practice of protecting
the energetic core

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of a sacred space continued
into the 12th century,

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:84%
when the Cistercian
monks and the Templars

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:84%
built the present
cathedral of Chartres.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, the town of
Chartres itself

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.050 align:middle line:10%
had already been the site of
mystery schools dating back

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:10%
to at least the time
of the druids who

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.970 align:middle line:10%
used to hold their
ecumenical council

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:10%
around a Neolithic
stone circle or a mound.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And this has since
been incorporated

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:84%
into the foundation of
successive churches.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So the present
cathedral actually

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:02.540 align:middle line:84%
betrays the true age of the site
because the summer solstice now

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:90%
rises several degrees off axis.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But back in 4000 BC
the shaft of sunlight

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.015 align:middle line:90%
would have shone through.

00:38:11.015 --> 00:38:15.180 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:10%
The cathedral's
location, its dimensions,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:10%
its architectural features also
referenced underground water

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:10%
courses which generate a
natural electrical current

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:10%
as they percolate
through the limestone.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes there's the
main telluric current flowing

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:90%
down the nave.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And all of these
forces congregate

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:10%
above the original mound.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:10%
But to access the area
protecting the present altar,

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:10%
one must first cross
seven bands of energy.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.880 align:middle line:10%
Those seven gates that allow
passage from the physical

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.950 align:middle line:10%
into a state of bliss.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's not by accident that
this spot is called, the altar.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:90%


00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:84%
No doubt ancient
people discern places

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:84%
on the land that are
energetically different.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Aboriginal people refer to
them as increase centers.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And correct use of ritual
enables an interaction

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
with a life force
that propels the soul

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:90%
towards a state of ecstasy.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.170 align:middle line:10%
It allows a person to be
free of limitations imposed

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:10%
by the material world,
and constant interaction

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:10%
with sacred places
provides insights.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:10%
So the more apples you pick the
easier one reaches paradise.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.750 align:middle line:84%
People often travel
great distances

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:84%
expecting to see exceptional
buildings at such locations.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But often there are none
because in remote times,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.960 align:middle line:84%
people sensed the invisible
much more readily.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And so man-made structures
were unnecessary.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:10%
The energy was what
it was all about.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.620 align:middle line:10%
So in a matter of
speaking, the people

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:10%
who sought these hot spots
were following the advice

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:10%
given in ancient texts
such as the "Vedas" which

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.950 align:middle line:10%
refer to a specialized
knowledge being accessible

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:10%
at carefully chosen locations
throughout the planet.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:10%
Each one protected by a
deity to whom was entrusted

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:10%
a specific aspect of nature.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But as we began to forget how
to see or feel these hot spots,

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:84%
these invisible
libraries were marked,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.510 align:middle line:84%
sometimes by a humble
standing stone.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.490 align:middle line:10%
And around the
Mediterranean this

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:10%
was called a Betil, which
means a house of god.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.300 align:middle line:10%
Now clearly one upright stone
does not resemble a residence,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.570 align:middle line:10%
so the term must be
referring to the monolith

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.270 align:middle line:10%
as a repository
of a creative life

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:10%
force which of course, is the
original meaning behind a god.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Despite its simple appearance,
a humble standing stone

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:90%
can be deceptively powerful.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of
documented cases tell

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of people, doubters
in particular,

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:84%
receiving an electrical
shock after touching

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:19.530 align:middle line:84%
a monolith whose energy has
not been grounded in some time.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Because of the amount of quartz
and other conductive minerals

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:84%
in the stone, the piezo-electric
properties of these monoliths

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.780 align:middle line:84%
enables them to accumulate
ground current which is then

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.310 align:middle line:90%
stored like a giant battery.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.580 align:middle line:10%
Which brings us to
a larger inquiry,

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:10%
are these access points into
paradise haphazard or were they

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.620 align:middle line:10%
planned?

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:10%
Were they part of
a bigger picture?

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:10%
Because surviving Tamil
texts also pointed

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.750 align:middle line:10%
temples and other sacred
sites being deliberately built

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:10%
as a kind of insurance policy.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:10%
Or as one Egyptian text
puts it and I quote,

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:10%
whosoever shall make a
copy of a natural temple

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:10%
and make it so
upon the Earth, it

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:10%
shall act as a magical
protector for them

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.570 align:middle line:10%
in heaven and in
Earth, unfailingly,

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.940 align:middle line:10%
and regularly, and eternally.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Ancient architects recognized
how easily ordinary people are

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.590 align:middle line:84%
seduced by
self-defeating impulses

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and lose direction in
their earthly life.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:84%
These sages understood
the relationship

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:84%
between subtle energy, the
temple, and the balanced

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.090 align:middle line:90%
outlook of the individual.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:39.190 align:middle line:84%
An ongoing project to study
sites of remote antiquity

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.640 align:middle line:84%
has discovered how an
interconnected group of gods

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:84%
once established a global
network of sacred sites

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:84%
where anyone can access
paradise while still on Earth.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:57.960 align:middle line:10%
If lines of longitude are
drawn on the world map

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:10%
based on numbers unique
to the pentagram which

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:10%
is the geometry
of living things,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.370 align:middle line:10%
and technically
includes the Earth,

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:10%
then plot the location of some
of the oldest sacred places,

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:10%
a grid of power places
becomes quite apparent.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:10%
And certainly this plan was
known among esoteric schools

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.320 align:middle line:10%
right up to the medieval era.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.710 align:middle line:10%
It was even referred
to as the great work

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:10%
and it's an ongoing project
that has been maintained

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.070 align:middle line:10%
and promulgated by successive
groups of initiates.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's still a play
to this very day.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.080 align:middle line:84%
To demonstrate this
theory, let's start

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in a suburb of Cairo
called Heliopolis.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.840 align:middle line:84%
There are few reminders
of this location

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:84%
having once been the oldest
academy in Egypt in 10400 BC.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was originally
called Iunu.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.020 align:middle line:10%
The sacred mound on
the Nile represented

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:10%
the original primordial
mound into which

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.350 align:middle line:10%
was deposited the sum
of all the knowledge

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.270 align:middle line:10%
for the elevation of humanity.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the
pentagonal angle 108 degrees

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and travel west
from Iunu, we arrive

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.810 align:middle line:84%
at the capital of a new republic
founded by a group of Scottish

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Rite Freemasons.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.310 align:middle line:10%
And their aim was to further
the principles of enlightenment

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and liberty of the
individual as practiced

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.610 align:middle line:10%
by their predecessors,
the Knights Templar.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:34.700 align:middle line:10%
And 12,000 years before them at
Iunu, a group of divine people

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:39.640 align:middle line:10%
called the Shining Ones,
followers of Horus.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The exact spot of this
modern correspondence

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:84%
is marked by the Dome of the
Capitol in Washington DC.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:84%
This may be the last
place one would expect

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to experience
paradise and yet this

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:84%
was according to Thomas
Jefferson, one of its founders,

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to be the first temple
dedicated to the sovereignty

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.590 align:middle line:10%
And certainly it was a noble
ideal but stripped down

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:10%
to its basics, these
architects of this new Republic

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:10%
were working with
nothing more than energy.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And energy doesn't care
about right or wrong,

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.800 align:middle line:90%
it is simply energy.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.640 align:middle line:10%
But it's the intent that defines
whether this energy is directed

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.430 align:middle line:10%
to right action or not.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.760 align:middle line:10%
And just like the
ancient temples,

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:10%
the Capitol building
is not a lone entity.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.910 align:middle line:10%
It is part of a larger
mechanism that strategically

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:10%
links various
locations to create

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:10%
an influential
energetic environment.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, the blueprint
behind Washington DC

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:84%
enabled the site to function
as a landscape temple.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Just like Paris before
it, which itself

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.025 align:middle line:84%
is based on the blueprint
of Thebes in Egypt.

00:45:54.025 --> 00:45:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.760 align:middle line:10%
And by way of
demonstration, the obelisk,

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.490 align:middle line:10%
that is the Washington
Monument forms

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:10%
a right angled triangle
with the White House

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:10%
and the Dome of the Capitol.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:10%
An ancient teachings
refer to this relationship

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:12.900 align:middle line:10%
as a triple step of Vishnu.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:10%
A technique used
thousands of years

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.960 align:middle line:10%
ago to link like sighted
minds across the land

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.620 align:middle line:10%
by the power inherent in the
geometry of the triangle,

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:27.095 align:middle line:10%
the geometry that binds together
every atom and molecule.

00:46:27.095 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the relationship

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.370 align:middle line:84%
between true North, the Lincoln
Memorial and the White House

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:38.400 align:middle line:84%
which generates the Great
Pyramid angle of 51.49 degrees.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.280 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysics, this
is the creative process

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.070 align:middle line:90%
behind the conscious universe.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.970 align:middle line:10%
But to top it all, the
center of the Pentagon

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.910 align:middle line:10%
relative to the White
House and the Capitol

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:10%
forms the angle 32.72, known
to structural engineers

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.890 align:middle line:10%
as the angle of repose.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:03.300 align:middle line:10%
And in esoterica as
the angle of gravity.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:10%
At this highest of
teachings involves

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.610 align:middle line:10%
the understanding and
control of gravity so as

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.810 align:middle line:10%
to allow the soul to leave the
body consciously and access

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:10%
paradise at will.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:10%
It was the ultimate
teaching during initiation

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.310 align:middle line:10%
and its practitioners
were prepared

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.280 align:middle line:10%
to protect this information
with their lives

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.310 align:middle line:10%
rather than reveal
it to the unsavory.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Something that the Knights
Templar demonstrated quite well

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:32.110 align:middle line:10%
when they were burnt alive.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:37.260 align:middle line:10%
So if 32.72 became enshrined in
that well-known masonic ritual,

the 33rd degree.

00:47:38.385 --> 00:47:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:10%
Whether you were a
Templar Knight vowing

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.640 align:middle line:10%
to discover the
joys of paradise,

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:10%
or an Essene following
the way, or an initiate

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:10%
at Chichen Itza
picking the fruit

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.760 align:middle line:10%
from the tree of knowledge
so elegantly carved

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.140 align:middle line:10%
at the entrance
to its ball court,

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:10%
the journey into paradise
was marked by a marriage

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:10%
to a divine bride.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the sum of
all universal wisdom

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and the expansive
qualities it develops

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in the self was embodied
in the regenerative

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and fertilizing qualities
inherent in a divine woman.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Such qualities were
portrayed in Seshat,

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of sacred
buildings, the woman

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:27.470 align:middle line:84%
with a seven-petal flower
rising from her soul;

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.410 align:middle line:84%
its geometry synonymous
with the Great Pyramid

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamental
forces of creation.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:37.960 align:middle line:10%
So when Freemasons in
the 19th century Paris

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.840 align:middle line:10%
gifted an emerging Republic
across the Atlantic

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:10%
with another divine woman
with seven rays beaming

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:49.750 align:middle line:10%
from her soul, it was a reminder
to follow the path of wisdom.

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Which as Plato reminds us can
only be found in all its purity

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:90%
in paradise.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Only then can we hope to
attain liberty from ignorance.
