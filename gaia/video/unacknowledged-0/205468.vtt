00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> There were four
aliens aboard that thing.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And those aliens
went to Los Alamos.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And we were told that
the extraterrestrials went

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to Kirtland Field,
Kirtland Air Force Base,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and then on to Los Alamos.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Two pathologists said there
wasn't anything in the anatomy

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:10%
books.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything in
what our medical schools--

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:84%
they had never seen
anything like this.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:10%
>> At first, I thought it was
a child, because it was small.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.842 align:middle line:10%
Then I looked at
this head and all.

00:10:49.842 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:10%
The head was different.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:10%
There arms were spindly.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:10%
The body, it was gray.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But the creatures were
approximately four foot.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't appear
to have any ears.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> They only had two orifices.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:10%
They didn't have earlobes.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:10%
They had two ear canals.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> They had indentation for
nose, very, very big eyes.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And large eyes.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The fingers had no
thumbs, just four fingers.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Suction devices under
tips of their fingers.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the four fragile
fingers, and the long arm,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:90%
real short joint.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It almost looked
like they were nude,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
but they actually had a very
thin but tight-fitting suit on.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> One was alive, partially
alive at the time that this

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> They died in I
believe it was 1952.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But the bodies of
the extraterrestrials

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that were found
at the scene were

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
in a deep freeze,
placed in a deep freeze,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and sent to Wright-Patt
field in Dayton, Ohio.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the briefing officers
that was taking us around

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:10%
and talking about what was going
on, they said there had been

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.402 align:middle line:10%
over 100 crashes in
that Four Corners area.

00:11:56.402 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:10%
>> I just saw another craft--

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Holy shit.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:10%
>> After Roswell, there was a
flurry of ET activity across

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:10%
the globe.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer spent
eight years trying

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:84%
to persuade members of Congress
and other high level government

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
officials in the
intelligence community

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to disclose what was
happening, but to no avail.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So in 2001, he formed
the Disclosure Project.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
What you're about to see is
first-hand witness testimony

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
of events over
the past 50 years.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Many are telling their
stories for the first time.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
This is only the
tip of the iceberg,

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
as hundreds more have
given us their testimony,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
but are too fearful
to go on camera

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.572 align:middle line:84%
for fear of repercussions
for themselves

00:12:48.572 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and for their families.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:10%
"I feel that the
Air Force has not

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:10%
been giving out all the
available information

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:10%
on these unidentified
flying objects.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:10%
You cannot disregard so
many unimpeachable sources."

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:10%
Honorable John McCormack,
Speaker of the House.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm one of those what you
would call the high government

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:10%
officials in the FAA.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:10%
I was a division chief.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:10%
I was only three or four
down from the Admiral.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
The way it started, this
Japanese airline, 747,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:84%
was coming from
the northwest going

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
across the Alaskan territory.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So his radar is
picking up a target.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:10%
He sees this target with
his eye in the target.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
The way he described
it was a huge ball

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.873 align:middle line:84%
with lights running around it
four times as big as a 747.

00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese pilot would
say he's now at 11 o'clock,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.915 align:middle line:84%
he's now at 1 o'clock,
he's now at 3 o'clock.

00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
When he would say
that, the military guy

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
would cut in and say he's now
at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.033 align:middle line:84%
and he would confirm
the position.

00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:10%
He said this is the
first time they ever

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:10%
had 30 minutes of
radar data on a UFO.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're all itching to
get their hands into the data.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And if they come out and
told the American public

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that they ran into
a UFO out there,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.627 align:middle line:84%
it would cause panic
across the country.

00:14:07.627 --> 00:14:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you
can't talk about it.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking
all this data.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:10%
And I had the pilot's
report that came through.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had the FAA's
first report that

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:90%
was all downstairs on my table.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.284 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ask for that,
so I didn't give it to them.

00:14:21.284 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The plane that I was going
to be flying in was an F-104,

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
which was the fastest known
aircraft to mankind at that

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're flying down
the Rhine River.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:90%
We're up at high altitude.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And about that time, I spot
a bogey at about 10 o'clock

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't recognize the craft.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, bogey, 10:00.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And the captain looked
over there and said, well,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:90%
let's find out.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So he kicked it into afterburner
and we went after that.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And it disappeared
just like that.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
He says, please,
whatever you do,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
do not say anything
about this encounter.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:90%
It will get me in much trouble.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first
introduction to cover up.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.545 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything
was going along,

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.587 align:middle line:90%
pretty just ho-hum routine.

00:15:16.587 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They dimmed the lights
first in the command center

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
when they set it
Condition Zebra alert.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of the times when they set
these drills, they would say,

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:90%
this is a drill.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a drill.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:10%
But they turned the lights down
this time, and they didn't say,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:10%
this is a drill.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We had contact with an
unidentified flying object

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:90%
that had entered our airspace.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
We had it on radar
for almost an hour.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:10%
The order was given
by Admiral Train

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:10%
to try and get
this object forced

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:10%
down out of the sky,
if at all possible,

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:10%
by whatever means possible.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
What was really driving him
nuts was this thing absolutely

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:84%
had complete control
of the situation,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and could just be wherever
it wanted to be just

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:90%
in a matter of seconds.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:84%
One minute off the
coast of Maine,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:84%
the next minute it's in Norfolk
headed south towards Florida.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And after we found out
it wasn't the Russians,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
they didn't care who it
was or where it was from.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
They wanted it
and wanted it bad.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> At various times, I had
loaded and unloaded nuclear

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was considered
sane, so to speak,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and able to handle
nuclear weapons.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:10%
But apparently, UFOs are--

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.025 align:middle line:10%
well, I know that they're well
above even nuclear weapons

00:16:22.025 --> 00:16:22.825 align:middle line:10%
in secrecy.

00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
One particular
night, we had just

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:90%
finished our refueling mission.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
London Control called
us and asked us

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:84%
if we would intercept a UFO
over the center of England,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
roughly in the
Stonehenge Oxford area.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
We're up at 33,000
feet, and the UFO

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:90%
was down at about 1,000 feet.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:90%
We dove on it.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we got
up to close to it.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And we could see what
looked like a cruise ship

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
out at sea, with all the
lights and everything.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Got about a mile from it,
and it went up into space.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
London Control said you can
continue on with your mission.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, Prince Philip
felt it was very important.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We were invited to dinner
at the officers club

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
where he was a speaker, and
he knew all about the fact

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:90%
that we had chased the UFO.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
He kind of made me a
believer, in a sense.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I had seen them personally,
of course, before that.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
But when someone of
his stature indicates

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that they're real and
probably from another planet,

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
it's very convincing.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:10%

There were towers.

There were spherical buildings.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
There were very tall
towers, and things

that looked somewhat
like radar dishes,

00:19:54.648 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
but they were large structures.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:10%
And at that point,
I became frightened.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:10%
And I was a little
terrified thinking to myself

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.497 align:middle line:10%

The capsule door is blown
off, and Cooper's flight

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
ends, a performance that
exceeded the most optimistic

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:90%

on the edge of a dry lake.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:10%
And this saucer
flew right over him

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:10%
and put down three little gear
and landed on the dry lake bed.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:10%
And they went out and
picked up their cameras

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:10%
and moved on out
toward him, filming.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:10%
And he lifted off, put
the gear back in the well,

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:10%
and climbed up at a very high
rate of speed and disappeared.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:10%
I was involved in the
research and development

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:10%

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:10%
I knew that we didn't have
any mechanism of that kind.

The Russians didn't have
any of that type either.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.515 align:middle line:10%
At that point in time, there
is no doubt in my mind,

00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:10%
that this vehicle was made
at some other place than here

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.215 align:middle line:10%

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.157 align:middle line:10%

as it climbed into space
and shining a beam on it,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:10%
which neutralized the missile.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It flew into the
frame like this,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:10%
and it shot a beam of
light at the warhead,

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:10%
which is represented
by my thumb here.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So this thing fires a beam
of light at the warhead,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
hits it, and then this
thing flies up like this,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.428 align:middle line:84%
fires another beam of light,
goes around like this,

00:22:21.428 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
fires another beam of
light, goes down like this,

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.637 align:middle line:90%
fires another beam of light.

00:22:24.637 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And then flies out
the way it came in.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And the warhead
tumbles out of space.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And when the lights came, on
Major Mansmann turned around

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and looked at me and
said, were you guys

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.865 align:middle line:90%
screwing around up there?

00:22:36.865 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, sir.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what was that?

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it looks to
me like we've got a UFO.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of any explosion in
space by any Earth government

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
was not acceptable to

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And that has been
demonstrated over and over.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:10%

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.332 align:middle line:84%
I received a call from my

He and some of the
guards have been

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:10%
observing some strange lights
flying around the launch

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:10%
control facility.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, you mean UFO?

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.343 align:middle line:10%
I think I used that word.

00:23:27.343 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what they
were, but they were lights.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:90%
They were flying around.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of shook
my head and just

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.733 align:middle line:84%
said, well, call
me if anything more

00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
important than that happens.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:84%
He calls back, and this
time he's very frightened.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:10%
I can tell by the
tone of his voice he

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:10%
is very shook up, and
said, sir, there's

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:48.675 align:middle line:10%
a glowing red object hovering
right outside the front gate.

00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:10%
And as I was
relating this to him,

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:10%
our missiles started
shutting down one by one.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:10%
The Air Force did an
extensive investigation

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:10%
of the entire
incident, and was not

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:10%
able to come up with a probable
cause for the shutdowns.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:10%
The missiles are not
connected to each other.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:10%
Having a fault at one site
would not affect missiles

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:10%
at another location.

incursion after '47?

00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he
thought for a moment,

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well, obviously,
we have the atom bomb.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:90%

>> We just dropped two
bombs on a country.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
We had a test of that

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
a few weeks earlier,
in New Mexico.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:10%
This probably was observed
by these aliens somewhere,

whether they were doing
reconnaissance back then,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:10%
or how they figured it out.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So they came here to observe
and try to figure out

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:90%
what the heck was that?

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:10%

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:10%
of the first atomic weapons,
Roswell was the only nuclear

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:10%
armed squadron in the world.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> If you accept the
multidimensional theory,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
it's highly likely that we've
done a hell of a lot of damage

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:90%
in somebody else's world.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we've done more
damage there than we did here.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The underlying theme that
connects most of the Disclosure

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Project case files is the fact
that these close encounters

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:84%
tend to occur near our
nuclear facilities,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that these visitors
are deeply concerned with

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:84%
our hostility and the
existential threat that we pose

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves and others once
we learned to split the atom.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:10%
>> These are some of the highest
ranking military officials

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:10%
in our defense program.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:10%
They're trusted with
nuclear weapons.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
They're trusted with
top level security

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:90%
clearances and secrets.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But the minute
they start talking

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
subject, they become pariah.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:10%
>> "I believe the American
people are entitled to a more

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:10%
thorough explanation than has
been given them by the Air

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Force.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.640 align:middle line:10%
I think we owe it to the
people to establish credibility

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:10%
regarding UFOs, and to
produce the greatest

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:10%
possible enlightenment
of the subject."

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Former President Gerald Ford.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I am prepared to state that
I have been at locations where

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
craft of unknown origin that
did not originate on the face

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:90%
of this planet was there.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I am prepared to state
that while I was there,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
we saw living dead bodies
of entities that were not

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%
born on this planet.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:10%
I am prepared to
state that we had

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:10%
what they referred
to as interfacing

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:10%
with those entities.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Never is there any
compelling physical evidence.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is, who
are people like Carl Sagan,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and before him,
Professor Donald Menzel.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that Sagan,
in his early career,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:10%
actually spoke and
wrote about UFOs

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:10%
in a way that was affirmative,
that it was legitimate.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
After he was threatened by
the intelligence community

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and blackmailed, he then
began to debunk the issue.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Skepticism is very healthy.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big skeptic about
more than 90% of the information

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
out there on this subject,
which the public needs

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:90%
to be skeptical.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:84%
However, skepticism
is not just blindly

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
denying everything
that's legitimate.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have 3,500 cases
where extraterrestrial vehicles

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
have landed and left
physical traces.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We have 4,000 cases where they
have been tracked on radar

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and seen by pilots.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We have an enormous
amount of photo and video

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:84%
evidence and physical evidence,
and in our last project,

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
brought out an actual body
that is most likely not

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.080 align:middle line:90%
of human origin.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So the question becomes, what
is the metric for the evidence?

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the evidence is
actually overwhelming.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.370 align:middle line:84%
There's more evidence
for UFOs than there

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:84%
are for black holes, most of
the theories in astrophysics,

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:84%
most of the evidence for most
of the medicines you take.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking now
as a trauma doctor.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have this blockage
in the mainstream media

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and scientific establishment
saying where is the evidence?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> What do we know?

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We know now we live in an
ever-expanding universe.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
billions of stars and planets,

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:90%
literally, out there.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
is getting bigger.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
We know from our
fancy telescopes

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that just in the last two
years, more than 20 planets

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
have been identified outside
our solar system that

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
seem to be far enough away from
their suns and dense enough

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
that they might be able to
support some form of life.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.628 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it increasingly
less likely that we're alone.

00:29:00.628 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you're trying to give me
a hint that there are aliens.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.030 align:middle line:10%
>> "Of course flying
saucers are real,

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:10%
and they are interplanetary."

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:10%
Air Chief Marshall Lord Dowding.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was eight or nine,
I saw one of these objects

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:90%
in broad daylight.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a beautiful,
seamless disk in a blue sky,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
back when the skies
were very blue.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was with some boys
in the neighborhood.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this, and I went,
oh my god, they're real.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:90%
We saw a UFO.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, my parents said, oh,
well, you're just a kid.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But I became completely
absorbed in this.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.005 align:middle line:84%
So my interest in this
goes back to my childhood.

00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
The Disclosure Project was
an accident of history.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
In 1990, I formed the Center for
the Study of Extraterrestrial

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence to form
a diplomatic corps

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to make peaceful contact
with these civilizations.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:10%
Because once you conclude
that they're real

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:10%
and they're of
interstellar origin,

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.893 align:middle line:10%
the next question is, what
are we going to do about it?

00:30:01.893 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I concluded what we
should be doing about it is not

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:84%
militarizing the relationship,
but having sort of a citizens

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:84%
diplomacy effort, much like
the Physicians for Social

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Responsibility who were
going to the Soviet Union

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:84%
to create a dialogue during the
coldest days of the Cold War.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:84%
There was no one at the United
Nations or State Department

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:84%
or any foreign ministry
dealing with it.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So we started a set of
protocols to make contact.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, we had
some spectacular successes.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Holy damn hot shit.

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Hot dog.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This got kicked up to
the intelligence community.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So by 1992, I was getting
visits from the head of Army

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence, people inside
the National Security Agency,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and other three letter agencies.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
My intention was never to
get involved with trying

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:90%
to disclose this issue.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:84%
My interest was in this whole
concept of making contact

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:84%
for peaceful purposes to
advance our civilization

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
from a planetary civilization to
an interplanetary civilization.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:84%
That was really the heart
of my sincere interest.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But along that way, you
know, and eventually

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
a man who was friends with
the director of the CIA,

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
by the time Clinton
became president,

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.952 align:middle line:84%
who said that you're going
to be the first person

00:31:12.952 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:84%
to brief the director of Central
Intelligence and the Clinton

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:90%
administration on this.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they have made
inquiries, and they have been

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:84%
lied to, which I
did not believe.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was that
blunt about it.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:84%
This is really where I then
went down the rabbit hole.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.911 align:middle line:84%
>> So can the government
keep a secret this big?

00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest weapons in
the intelligence community's

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:84%
arsenal is our general
belief that the US government

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:84%
couldn't possibly
keep a secret this big

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:90%
from the American public.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:84%
But the existence of the
National Reconnaissance Office

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:84%
remained secret
for over 30 years.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:10%
The mere existence of the
NSA, jokingly referred to

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:10%
as No Such Agency,
was kept secret

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:10%
until it grew so large that
it was quite conspicuous.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And those working in
the Manhattan Project

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.570 align:middle line:84%
developing the
atom bomb were told

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that any secrets
that they disclose

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
would result in
10 years in prison

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:84%
or an equivalent
of $100,000 fine.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Only when the weapons were
used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:84%
did the government
disclose what they were.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Of all things to keep secret,
the fact that there is this

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:10%
bountiful option that we have
of reaching out into the stars

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.640 align:middle line:10%
and being friendly neighbors
with other civilizations,

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:10%
and sharing information,
and sharing resources,

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:10%
and sharing knowledge, and
sharing spiritual insights

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:10%
and values, to suppress that
information and to conceal it

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:10%
is part of the efforts of a
national security state that is

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:10%
threatened by that reality.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the ultimate secrets

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be exposed.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:10%
>> "We have, indeed,
been contacted,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:10%
perhaps even visited, by
extraterrestrial beings.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:10%
And the US government,
in collusion

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:10%
with the other national
powers of the Earth,

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:10%
is determined to
keep this information

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:10%
from the general public."

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:10%
Victor Marchetti,
former Special Assistant

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:10%
to the Executive
Director of the CIA.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And in this document from
the Canadian government,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:84%
"the matter is the most
highly classified subject

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
in the United States government,
rating higher than the H-bomb."

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the most top
secret doomsday weapon

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:90%
at the time in development.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And the second item, B.
"Flying saucers exist."

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:84%
C, "their modus
operandi is unknown,

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:84%
but concentrated effort is being
made by a small group headed

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Vannevar Bush.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And then D, "the entire
matter is considered

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:84%
by the United States
authorities to be

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:90%
of tremendous significance."

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.500 align:middle line:84%
What is more sensitive than
the development of the hydrogen

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:90%
bomb prior to its detonation?

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:90%
The UFO issue.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:84%
A priori, therefore,
the entire subject

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:84%
has been managed in a
way from the '40s onward

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
with extraordinary
secrecy around it.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The event at Roswell,
because it resulted

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:84%
in the acquisition of materiel
that could be studied,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:84%
it created a sea change in
the whole national security

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
organization.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because within weeks of that
event, the CIA was formed.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Within weeks, there
was the formation

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:84%
of the Air Force, which was
split off from the Army Air

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.940 align:middle line:10%
It also led, however,
the development

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.840 align:middle line:10%
of unacknowledged special
access projects, which

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:10%
is why Eisenhower, even though
he knew about the subject

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:10%
on a fairly deep level, had
completely lost control of it

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.380 align:middle line:10%
by 1961 when he left office.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:84%
influence, whether
sought or unsought,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
by the military
industrial complex.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, because
you think of generals,

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and you think of conservatives
and Republicans as being very

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:90%
pro-military and business.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But he's talking about
the illegal part of it.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.940 align:middle line:84%
He's not talking about
the conventional military.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:10%
>> But it's now the military
industrial intelligence complex

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:10%
that are moving bureaucratically
toward establishing dominion

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.180 align:middle line:10%
and control over the
entire democratic process

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:10%
in the country.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And that they're waging war,
invading the Middle Eastern oil

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:84%
fields and occupying
the oil fields,

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:84%
attempting to establish
what they themselves refer

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.728 align:middle line:90%
to as full spectrum dominance.

00:35:48.728 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> But we're going
to smoke them out.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the public
has to understand,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
there became to be
this bifurcation,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
this separation between
legitimate national security

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and military operations and the
deep black programs that are

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:90%
unacknowledged.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the black budget,

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the deep black, super secret,
unacknowledged budget that

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
runs in the $100 to
$200 billion a year.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm being conservative.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:10%
>> My '03 budget calls for more
than $48 billion in new defense

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:10%
spending.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> More money for the Pentagon
when its own auditors admit

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.570 align:middle line:84%
the military cannot account for
25% of what it already spends.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> According to some estimates,
we cannot track $2.3 trillion

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:90%
in transactions.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> $2.3 trillion, with a T.
That's $8,000 for every man,

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.840 align:middle line:90%
woman, and child in America.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:10%
>> We're spending well over $100
million per day on classified

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.380 align:middle line:10%
programs that have no
Congressional oversight,

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:10%
no public scrutiny.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no monitor
of these programs.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
A number of these programs
go directly through Congress

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:90%
totally.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.000 align:middle line:84%
When you start going
through these documents,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:84%
these programs start dropping
off the radar screen.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:10%
These are all classified
programs within the defense

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:10%
budget, but they don't supply
any technical information

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:10%
on the program.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And if people think that
the Congress and the president

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.430 align:middle line:84%
actually have a handle on
this, they're gravely mistaken.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:90%
They do not.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.770 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get into
the structure of secrecy.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The structure of secrecy
is complex and multifaceted.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:10%
We've been led to
believe that we

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:10%
live in a mostly
transparent democracy,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.030 align:middle line:10%
with the president at the top
of the intelligence food chain.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:90%
A true commander in chief.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.790 align:middle line:84%
The reality, however,
is much different.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:50.320 align:middle line:10%
>> A shadowy government with
its own Air Force, its own Navy,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:10%
its own fundraising mechanism,
and the ability to pursue its

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:10%
own ideas of the
national interest,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:10%
free from all
checks and balances,

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.450 align:middle line:10%
and free from the law itself.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's secrecy
that is legal.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, where Edward
Snowden made his mistake,

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
was by disclosing
secrets, no matter

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.920 align:middle line:84%
how inappropriate it might have
been that they were going on,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that were being managed legally,
that the president and Congress

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence
committees knew about.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>> A traitor.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.170 align:middle line:90%
A traitor to the United States.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> On the other hand, there's
secrecy that is illegal.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And these are the unacknowledged
special access projects, USAPs,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.070 align:middle line:90%
U-S-A-P for short.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What they've done is they've
formed this alliance among

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:39.070 align:middle line:84%
themselves of the industry that
makes money by building war

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:43.510 align:middle line:84%
machines, the military that uses
the war machines and justifies

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:47.047 align:middle line:84%
them, and then the intelligence
community that is not really

00:38:47.047 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:90%
an intelligence community.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a covert
operations community,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:10%
armed with military weapons and
nuclear weapons in that they're

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:10%
trying to push
the boundaries now

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:10%
of establishing their
dominion and full spectrum

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.040 align:middle line:10%
dominance over the planet.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:10%
>> And in this document,
the first document

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.110 align:middle line:10%
that's on the briefing for
President Obama's brief we put

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:10%
together that we
gave to John Podesta,

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.380 align:middle line:10%
this document lists the
compartmented operations out

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:10%
of the Nellis Facility, what the
public wrongly calls Area 51.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I gave this document to
the head of intelligence

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:84%
for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Admiral Tom Wilson.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is J2.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the guy who puts the
intelligence briefings together

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.130 align:middle line:84%
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff
of the United States of America.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And he got hold of one
of these compartments.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, hello,
I'm Admiral Tom Wilson.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.687 align:middle line:84%
I want to be read into, or
briefed, on this project.

00:39:35.687 --> 00:39:36.520 align:middle line:90%
They said, yes, sir.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
We know who you are, and you
don't have a need to know.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a need to know.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:84%
The Head of Intelligence for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
the military have

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.520 align:middle line:90%
been victims of the secrecy.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Because there are many
generals and admirals

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and very good officers
I've met with who

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.950 align:middle line:84%
have enormous responsibility,
that everyone-- if you polled

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.800 align:middle line:84%
1,000 people on the street, I
think every single person would

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.480 align:middle line:84%
say something this sensitive,
they would know about.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't have
knowledge about it,

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.940 align:middle line:84%
if they asked about
it, they will be told.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.420 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> There are very clear efforts
to engage in covert programs,

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and to keep the knowledge of
those programs away from people

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:84%
even in positions of
constitutional authority.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Dick Cheney, he would
have a need to know.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.680 align:middle line:90%
They call him Darth Cheney.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.900 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about people way up

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.300 align:middle line:84%
in the defense
industry, people who

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:84%
are running this comp
works, people like Ben Rich,

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.200 align:middle line:90%
like Kelly Johnson.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So these unacknowledged
special access projects do not

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:84%
care what your rank
and position is.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:90%
They care about one thing.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Will you go along
with their agenda?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what happened when

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I met with Lord Hill Norton.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Since my name has become
connected with UFO matters

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:10%
in quite a big way
in this country,

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.510 align:middle line:10%
I have frequently been asked
by a person of my background,

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:10%
a former chief of
the defense staff,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:10%
a former chairman of the
NATO military committee,

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:04.990 align:middle line:10%
what the reasons may be for
governments wishing to cover up

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:10%
the facts about UFOs?

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:10%
That, I believe, is
because governments

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:10%
fear that if they did disclose
those, that people would panic.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The only thing he
really wanted to know was,

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I was head of the
Ministry of Defense,

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:84%
head of the Military Committee
for NATO, head of MI5, MI6.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they have told me?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, sir,
with all due respect,

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.640 align:middle line:84%
what would you have
done if you'd found out

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that there was a project
that was illegal,

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:84%
engaged in assassinations,
that was keeping from,

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:40.390 align:middle line:84%
not only our leaders and our
constitutionally required

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:84%
oversight, technologies and
information, that would enable

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:84%
us to have a whole new
civilization on this planet

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:84%
without pollution, or
dependency on Mideast oil,

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:90%
or what have you?

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I wouldn't
have stood for it

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.780 align:middle line:90%
for a bloody minute.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was just in
a rage about it.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's why
they didn't tell you.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Several US presidents are
on record talking about the UFO

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.510 align:middle line:10%
mystery.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Presidents Jimmy
Carter, Ronald Reagan,

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:10%
both had UFO sightings
of their own.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.480 align:middle line:84%
But the current
presidential campaign

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.440 align:middle line:84%
might be the first in which UFO
disclosure has been championed

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:90%
by a major party candidate.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We had your husband,
President Clinton,

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.720 align:middle line:90%
on this show.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.113 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about UFOs and
Area 51 and if he looked--

00:42:21.113 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:84%
because if I was president,
that's the first thing I'd do.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.863 align:middle line:84%
I'd go right into those files
and see what was going on.

00:42:25.863 --> 00:42:26.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:26.663 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said that
he did do that.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And that he
didn't find anything.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well-- I'm going
to do it again.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, why not?

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
there's a new name.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It's Unexplained
Aerial Phenomenon.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Unexplained
aerial phenomenon.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> UAP.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.853 align:middle line:90%
That's the latest nomenclature.

00:42:49.853 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I like the old one.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I like UFO.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Within a couple months of
me briefing the CIA director,

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I get a visit from one of
Bill Clinton's good friends

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to my home, who says, they
love what you're recommending,

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that the president do executive
orders to declassify and bring

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:90%
all this information out.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.710 align:middle line:84%
This man comes to
my house and says,

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.066 align:middle line:84%
they really think
that's a great idea.

00:43:11.066 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:90%
The president won't do it.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:90%
It's too dangerous.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.113 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
he's the president.

00:43:16.113 --> 00:43:17.530 align:middle line:10%
He didn't want to
be president, he

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:19.280 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't have taken
on the responsibility

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:10%
and sworn an oath
to the Constitution.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And he says, yeah, but
you don't understand.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't think that they
can protect the president.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting at the
dinner table with my children.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
they're concerned

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that President Clinton will
end up like Jack Kennedy.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:90%
And I start laughing.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I mean, I really
started laughing out loud,

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.690 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
this is nonsense.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.900 align:middle line:84%
This is, like,
conspiracy kookville.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, no, this is
absolutely their concern,

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is that if he pushes on
this, he is in mortal peril.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Kennedy may have been engaged
in a bit of a struggle with

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.870 align:middle line:10%
the CIA in trying--

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:10%
attempting to get more
information on the UFO subject,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.440 align:middle line:10%
how that might account
for his termination.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And that morning, in
two of the English-speaking

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.750 align:middle line:84%
newspapers, there was
a picture of two UFOs.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So I had placed
those on his table

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
where he was going
to be sitting.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.753 align:middle line:84%
And I said, good
morning, Mr. President.

00:44:18.753 --> 00:44:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I sat him down and
said, would you

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.640 align:middle line:90%
like to have coffee and juice?

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.810 align:middle line:10%
So while I was getting that,
he's looking at the papers.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:10%
I came back in.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:84%
President Kennedy says,
what do you think?

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I looked at him.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.788 align:middle line:90%
I looked down at the picture.

00:44:31.788 --> 00:44:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I says, well, sir,
what do you think?

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And with that magnificent
grin of his, he said,

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I asked you first.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, from what
I've learned, we

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.200 align:middle line:84%
can't be the only living
beings in God's creation.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.700 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're
right, young man.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.580 align:middle line:10%
There is considerable
knowledge as far

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.360 align:middle line:10%
as the actual being of
UFO and ET phenomena

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.760 align:middle line:10%
that we're aware of today.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> "I am convinced that UFOs
exist, because I've seen one."

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.170 align:middle line:90%
President Jimmy Carter.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> When President
Carter was elected,

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I was the legal counsel for the
Jesuit National Headquarters

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.090 align:middle line:84%
He called the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency,

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.310 align:middle line:90%
George HW Bush, to a meeting.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And asked Bush if, he as
the director of Central

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence, would give to
Carter as the President-elect

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:25.510 align:middle line:84%
all the information he had
on the potential existence

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.750 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial life,
and the issue of whether

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.750 align:middle line:84%
or not any of the UFO
vehicles might be vehicles

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.410 align:middle line:90%
from another star system.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And George HW Bush refused
to give him the information.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.623 align:middle line:84%
Said he'd have to go to
Congress and get Congress

00:45:40.623 --> 00:45:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to have the
Congressional Research

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Service at the
Library of Congress

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:84%
declassify it to get it to
him if he was going to get it.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a true story.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:53.080 align:middle line:10%
>> In some of these cases,
absolutely the president has no

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.360 align:middle line:10%
need to know, because
he's a temporary employee.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.640 align:middle line:84%
He's strictly a
temporary employee.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.880 align:middle line:84%
He does not have a need to
know on some of these deeper

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:84%
black programs within
the Skunk Works,

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:84%
within the Boeing Phantom Works
and also within the Black Widow

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Group of Northrop.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Congressional Research
Service at the Library

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of Congress, their science
and technology division,

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:16.630 align:middle line:84%
based on all the information
classified and declassified

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that they have reviewed, their
projection was that there were

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:24.020 align:middle line:84%
at least from two to six
other highly intelligent,

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.900 align:middle line:84%
highly technologically
developed,

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:30.895 align:middle line:84%
but non-human civilizations
just in our Milky Way galaxy.

00:46:30.895 --> 00:46:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> There was deep concern that
something this important would

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.640 align:middle line:84%
be kept out of the
briefings for the president.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.200 align:middle line:84%
My sort of coming of
age, which was hard--

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.150 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.040 align:middle line:90%
It's hard talking about this.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to say I was
a young doctor asked

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.440 align:middle line:90%
to do something like this.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm a doctor in an ER taking
care of shootings and stabbings

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and car wrecks.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm being asked to brief
the CIA director on stuff,

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:13.480 align:middle line:84%
because he and the
president are being lied to?

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, are you--

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.575 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you fucking crazy?

00:47:17.575 --> 00:47:20.910 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.440 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Frankly, it was devastating.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.750 align:middle line:10%
Initially, I have to
admit, the CIA director, I

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.240 align:middle line:10%
thought, to be honest
with you, that he

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:35.070 align:middle line:10%
was sort of picking my brain to
find out what I knew as opposed

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:36.290 align:middle line:10%
to really not knowing.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But by the time the
three-hour meeting was over,

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:42.210 align:middle line:84%
it was quite clear that
the emperor has no clothes.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:46.770 align:middle line:84%
He later denied the meeting
that happened for a briefing.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a wonderful thing.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, people say, how could he
write this letter basically

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.600 align:middle line:84%
saying that this
meeting and what I

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.495 align:middle line:84%
said about it was a
distortion of the truth?

00:47:56.495 --> 00:47:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, because
he didn't realize

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:00.390 align:middle line:90%
there was a record beforehand.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And thank god I saved
the document that

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.260 align:middle line:90%
is the original invitation.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that letter,
it is explicit.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.720 align:middle line:84%
"I talked to Woolsey
this morning,

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and he suggested
getting together.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:10%
There is an active
attempt being made

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.460 align:middle line:10%
at lower levels of government
to sabotage Project Starlight",

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.290 align:middle line:10%
which was the
initiative I started

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.210 align:middle line:10%
and Laurance
Rockefeller helped fund,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.030 align:middle line:10%
to bring all these top secret
people together and recommend

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.520 align:middle line:10%
these changes to the
Clinton administration.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, "this
group almost certainly has

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.920 align:middle line:84%
tapped your phones
and is aware of most

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.720 align:middle line:90%
of the details of your plans.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the most powerful
people in the world

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:43.170 align:middle line:84%
will have a deep, compelling
interest in our activities

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and will use everything
at their disposal

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to effect their objective."

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, come on.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.830 align:middle line:84%
This is like a bad
conspiracy novel.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Except this became my life.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I just became
the first president to ever

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.234 align:middle line:90%
publicly mention Area 51.

00:48:59.234 --> 00:49:00.034 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:00.034 --> 00:49:03.870 align:middle line:90%
How's that, folks?

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Based upon what
Jimmy Carter has said,

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and based upon what
Bill Clinton has said,

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that they were refused
this information,

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.667 align:middle line:84%
I believe that is
unconstitutional for them

00:49:14.667 --> 00:49:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to refuse to give the
information to the President

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Many of the Disclosure
Project witnesses have had

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:25.080 align:middle line:10%
a close encounter with
another facet of the structure

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.490 align:middle line:10%
of secrecy.

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:33.090 align:middle line:10%
>> People who did not agree
with this extraordinary secrecy,

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:37.560 align:middle line:10%
and made trouble for them,
ended up having horrific things

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.410 align:middle line:10%
happen.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:44.515 align:middle line:10%
>> He was talking
about being erased.

00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, man, I said,
what do you mean, erased?

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.330 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:90%
He said, you will be erased.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If you tell anyone who is
not in this room about this

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:84%
project, this bullet
has your name on it.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And it will find you.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Measures have been taken by
agencies to terminate people

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:14.320 align:middle line:84%
who appear to be inconvenient or
troublesome through knowing too

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.130 align:middle line:90%
much.

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.560 align:middle line:10%
>> I've had a hell of a time
after I've told this story,

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.970 align:middle line:10%
but I continue to
tell the story,

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.470 align:middle line:10%
because I think it's important
for people to understand that

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:10%
this sort of shit goes
on in the government.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.417 align:middle line:84%
That the government
covers up information

00:50:26.417 --> 00:50:28.000 align:middle line:84%
that we are entitled
to know about it,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.340 align:middle line:90%
citizens of this country.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> They'll go after
not only you, he said,

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:32.710 align:middle line:90%
they'll go after your family.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:35.238 align:middle line:10%
>> They were like, look,
man, we're going to just--

00:50:35.238 --> 00:50:37.030 align:middle line:10%
we're going to take
you off in a helicopter

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:40.075 align:middle line:10%
and just kick your
ass out in the jungle.

00:50:40.075 --> 00:50:41.710 align:middle line:10%
And you're just gonna--

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:43.218 align:middle line:10%
we're going to end
you and all this.

00:50:43.218 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:10%
>> They were never there.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.093 align:middle line:10%
This never happened.

00:50:45.093 --> 00:50:46.730 align:middle line:10%
When I asked him at
the time, I said,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why
you're saying this.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:51.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's-- there
was something there.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not the stealth
bomber, then, you know,

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.840 align:middle line:90%
it's a UFO.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.612 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a UFO, why wouldn't
you want the people to know?

00:50:58.612 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they get all
excited over that.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
say those words.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And there have been
dozens and dozens of totally,

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:09.310 align:middle line:84%
absolutely important, credible
people who've had their careers

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:13.330 align:middle line:84%
ruined intentionally by the
National Security bureaucracy,

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:84%
because they tried to come
forward and fulfill what they

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:20.050 align:middle line:84%
viewed to be their duty to
report this to their superiors.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> 3 o'clock in the morning,
4 o'clock in the morning,

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:26.300 align:middle line:84%
midnight, 10 o'clock, people
would call and start screaming

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.100 align:middle line:90%
at me.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.475 align:middle line:84%
"You're going
down, motherfucker.

00:51:28.475 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going down,
motherfucker."

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And he just
said, look, mister.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.880 align:middle line:10%
Don't go in and start
any rumors in Roswell.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.890 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing
happened out here.

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But who do you tell that you
were involved in a UFO incident

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:84%
without them looking at you like
you ain't wrapped too tight?

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.760 align:middle line:10%
>> One night, somebody blew
up my mailbox by putting a big

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.130 align:middle line:10%
load of skyrockets in it.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.590 align:middle line:90%
The mailbox went up in flames.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And that night, at 1 o'clock
in the morning, the phone rang.

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up, and somebody
said "skyrockets in your box

00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what a beautiful
sight, motherfucker."

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly, there was a
man on my executive committee.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:07.360 align:middle line:84%
He was a very well-known actor
and singer named Burl Ives.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And Burl Ives, he was a
Thirty-Third Degree Mason.

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So all of you people
who think that all

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.920 align:middle line:84%
these secret societies,
everyone in it knows everything,

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.090 align:middle line:90%
they don't know anything.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
he says, we all

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.980 align:middle line:84%
know that Marilyn Monroe
didn't die of an overdose.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Boo boo bee-doo.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He said do you know
why they killed Marilyn?

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. President, the
late Marilyn Monroe.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, well, I didn't
until I got this document.

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a virtual death warrant.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Because she was found
a couple of days later.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.010 align:middle line:90%
"3 August, 1962.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Wiretap of telephone
conversations

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.390 align:middle line:84%
between reporter
Dorothy Kilgallen, who

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.780 align:middle line:84%
was looking into Roswell
and other UFO issues

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and her close friend,
Howard Rothberg.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.490 align:middle line:84%
From wiretap of
telephone conversation

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of Marilyn Monroe and Attorney
General Bobby Kennedy.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.760 align:middle line:10%
Rothberg discussed
the apparent comeback

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.110 align:middle line:10%
of the subject with
Kilgallen and the break up

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:03.910 align:middle line:10%
with the Kennedys."

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:06.670 align:middle line:84%
This is referring to the
fact that Marilyn Monroe had

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:84%
been having an affair with not
one but both Kennedy brothers,

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was becoming conspicuous,
so they broke it off.

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:10%
"Rothberg indicated
in so many words

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:10%
that she had secrets to tell,
no doubt arising from her trysts

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:21.010 align:middle line:10%
with the president and
the attorney general.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:22.870 align:middle line:10%
One such secret
mentions the visit

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.300 align:middle line:10%
of the president
at a secret airbase

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:29.630 align:middle line:10%
for the purpose of inspecting
things from outer space."

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is 1962.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Kilgallen said if
the story is true,

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:35.860 align:middle line:84%
it would be a
terrible embarrassment

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:38.590 align:middle line:84%
for Jack and his plans to
have NASA put men on the moon.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.190 align:middle line:10%
>> We choose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:44.930 align:middle line:10%
things, not because
they are easy,

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.480 align:middle line:10%
but because they are hard.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.730 align:middle line:10%
>> "The subject repeatedly
called the attorney general

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.813 align:middle line:10%
and complained about the
way she was being ignored

00:53:50.813 --> 00:53:52.330 align:middle line:10%
by the president
and his brother.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Subject threatened to
hold a press conference

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and would tell all."

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a tragic situation,
because she was an actress.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.228 align:middle line:84%
She didn't understand the
national security state

00:54:01.228 --> 00:54:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and the viciousness
of those who want

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to keep these sort of secrets.

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The aliens won't
let it happen.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:08.680 align:middle line:90%
We reveal all their secrets.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.023 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] They exercise
strict control over us.

00:54:12.023 --> 00:54:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you know, there are a
lot of people that are going

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to examine your facial
expressions here, every twitch,

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:21.490 align:middle line:84%
everything, and say-- and
of course, so did you look?

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Did you see?

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.805 align:middle line:90%
Did you explore?

00:54:24.805 --> 00:54:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't reveal anything.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Because President Clinton
said he did go right in,

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and he did check, and
there was nothing.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, that's
what we're instructed to say.

[LAUGHTER]

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.500 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most powerful
elements of the structure

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:10%

Westinghouse, and good old GE?

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:05.026 align:middle line:10%
(SINGING) They own
networks from CBS to CNBC.

00:55:05.026 --> 00:55:09.040 align:middle line:10%
They can use them to
say whatever they preach

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:10%
and put down the opinions
of anyone who disagrees.

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We observed firsthand
the intelligence community

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.860 align:middle line:84%
influencing the media when
they're trying to cover this

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:19.660 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.730 align:middle line:84%
We have memoranda
after memoranda

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:25.810 align:middle line:84%
after memoranda citing
the psychological warfare

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and propaganda value
of the subject.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:30.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a very important thing
for the public to understand.

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.700 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep
something secret?

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.590 align:middle line:90%
You hide it in plain sight.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>> And I suspect that unless
the Defense Department proves us

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.520 align:middle line:10%
otherwise, that it was
probably some form of an alien

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.320 align:middle line:10%
spacecraft.

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.778 align:middle line:10%
And I think as a
public figure, you

00:55:45.778 --> 00:55:47.890 align:middle line:10%
have to be very careful
about what you say,

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:52.450 align:middle line:10%
because people can have
pretty emotional reactions.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said my goal wasn't
to try to stir the pot.

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And, now I'll ask Officer
Stein and his colleagues

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to escort the accused into the
room so that we may all look

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.742 align:middle line:90%
upon the guilty party.

00:56:03.742 --> 00:56:05.325 align:middle line:84%
Don't get him too
close to me, please.

00:56:05.325 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In the alien costume, the
Governor's chief of staff.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And this just goes to show
that you guys are entirely too

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:90%
serious.

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's there.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- I mean, 5%
of the US population

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:19.600 align:middle line:90%
have seen these objects.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But you create an environment
where the subject is so

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:29.050 align:middle line:84%
pilloried and ridiculed that no
respectable scientist or doctor

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:30.550 align:middle line:84%
would want to be
identified with it.

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Internal documents from
the Defense Department

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence agencies
explicitly stating that they

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.190 align:middle line:84%
want to have this campaign
of ridiculing and destroying

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the credibility of
completely credible,

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.790 align:middle line:84%
completely honest
eyewitnesses to UFO sightings,

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and even sightings of
extraterrestrial beings

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.980 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, that they
want them discredited.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.930 align:middle line:84%
They want their
credibility destroyed.

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.620 align:middle line:10%
>> If someone comes out and
says, I saw a UFO on TV,

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:10%
the only ones that see a
UFO in the TV programs are

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:04.030 align:middle line:10%
the rednecks out in the country
that are going coon hunting

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:06.340 align:middle line:10%
or alligator hunting at night.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't find anybody
with any kind of smarts

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:13.720 align:middle line:84%
or some professional individual
saying, hey, last night,

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.160 align:middle line:90%
let me tell you what I saw.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.790 align:middle line:10%
>> And this officially was
released by the CIA talking

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:23.920 align:middle line:10%
about how they have people
embedded in all the major media

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:29.260 align:middle line:10%
to change, alter, and affect
stories to their benefit.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.610 align:middle line:10%
>> You are fake news.

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:10%
>> So every news agency, every
television and radio station

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:42.970 align:middle line:10%
in the Albuquerque and Santa Fe
area had our snitches in there.

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:44.410 align:middle line:90%
So we knew.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And we paid them.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.530 align:middle line:90%
We paid them good money.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:51.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons you get
to people is you pay them.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was controversial.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.580 align:middle line:90%
That was somewhat controversial.

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you know of national
media that have had--

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yes.

00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:58.180 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:58.540 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.665 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to name them.

00:57:59.665 --> 00:58:02.530 align:middle line:10%
>> "We now have a relationship
with reporters from every,"

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.670 align:middle line:10%
underlined, "major wire
service, newspaper, news weekly,

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.710 align:middle line:10%
and television
network in the nation.

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:11.260 align:middle line:10%
In many instances, we
have persuaded reporters

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.460 align:middle line:10%
to postpone, change,
hold, or even scrap

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.220 align:middle line:10%
stories that could
have adversely affected

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.910 align:middle line:10%
national security interests
or jeopardized our sources

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:23.020 align:middle line:10%
and methods."

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on to then say
that they have the same

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.510 align:middle line:90%
within academic circles.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.990 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a finding that the
Pike committee made that they

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:37.540 align:middle line:10%
had verified 42 full-time
Central Intelligence Agency

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:42.910 align:middle line:10%
paid employees that were
inserted inside the major

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:45.580 align:middle line:10%
national news media centers.

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And most of them ended up being
the so-called national security

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.860 align:middle line:90%
reporters.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The man turned to me, and
this is a board member of Time

00:58:54.790 --> 00:59:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Life, and said, Dr. Greer, we
basically are scribes taking

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:03.640 align:middle line:84%
dictation from the
right hand of the King.

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.010 align:middle line:90%
The fourth estate is dead.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I know reporters
for "Time Magazine"

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.260 align:middle line:84%
who have told me specifically
that they've provided

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.570 align:middle line:84%
the stories, and their
editors have spiked them.

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:18.160 align:middle line:84%
The high level
producers and directors.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.220 align:middle line:10%
>> And were they-- how were they
paid so that it wasn't known?

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Cash.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You pay.

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:30.720 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you make them
sign a form, and you tell them,

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.030 align:middle line:84%
you've got to report
this to the IRS.

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:35.220 align:middle line:84%
But whether they do
it or not, you're

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.590 align:middle line:84%
not going to give
your form to IRS.

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I paid-- I paid--

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:44.970 align:middle line:90%
I'd better not say.

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:47.160 align:middle line:84%
There were-- some
of them were large.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If you, Miss MacLaine, know
of any proof about aliens,

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.637 align:middle line:90%
you can give it to me.

00:59:51.637 --> 00:59:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you
I will get it out.

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.240 align:middle line:90%
But I am skeptical.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Based upon my
experience representing NBC

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and representing the
"New York Times,"

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that they will refuse
to publish information which,

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:08.310 align:middle line:84%
in my judgment, is clearly
important information

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.050 align:middle line:90%
for the public to know.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The corruption of the
media means that you have then

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:18.540 align:middle line:84%
undermined democracy and
our basic constitutional

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.710 align:middle line:90%
protections.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.590 align:middle line:10%
Because if you control
the information flow

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
through the elite media,
and the only place

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.260 align:middle line:10%
you can get this information is
through the tabloids where they

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.725 align:middle line:10%
want it, because it's
discredited there,

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
or on the internet,
where there's

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%
so much false information
that's mixed in with the real

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:38.130 align:middle line:10%
information that you don't
know what to make of it,

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:41.760 align:middle line:10%
there creates this
complete confusion.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.640 align:middle line:10%
>> When you go to a supermarket
checkout and you look

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.970 align:middle line:10%
at the tabloids, what you may
be reading there are actual

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:52.650 align:middle line:10%
stories of actual events.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But when it's portrayed
through the tabloids,

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.760 align:middle line:90%
it gets discredited.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're ridiculed, and
their careers are destroyed

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
pursuant to a very specific
self-conscious official

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:04.590 align:middle line:90%
program.

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this has
worked for 50 years.

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:07.518 align:middle line:90%
Why would they change it now?

01:01:07.518 --> 01:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the technique
they've used.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> "It is time for the
truth to be brought out.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Behind the scenes,
high-ranking Air Force officers

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
are soberly concerned
about the UFOs.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But through official
secrecy and ridicule,

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
many citizens are led to
believe the unknown flying

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.580 align:middle line:90%
objects are nonsense.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I urge immediate
Congressional action

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the
dangers from secrecy

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
about unidentified
flying objects."

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
CIA director, Vice Admiral
Roscoe Hillenkoetter.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we're sort of
living in "The Truman Show".

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks we
have a free press.

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:43.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We have a democratic
process where

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
all these sort of sensitive
issues will be handled legally.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
We do not.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And that we have an uncorrupted
scientific establishment,

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
which we do not, and
which we will prove.

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The structure of secrecy
extends to the scientific

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and academic arenas, where a
deliberate effort to spread

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
disinformation has been
going on for decades.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:10.290 align:middle line:10%
From professional debunkers
to CIA-funded committees,

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:14.040 align:middle line:10%
our trusted academics
and scientists

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.940 align:middle line:10%
have been complicit
in the secrecy.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.800 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people
see something.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
see things that are

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.370 align:middle line:10%
really-- they can't identify.

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:25.770 align:middle line:10%
But that doesn't mean they
were-- it's quite a leap.

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that people report
seeing things they cannot

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.030 align:middle line:90%
identify.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But after spending
25 years, I've

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
found not a shred of
evidence that we have

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.480 align:middle line:90%
alien visitors in our skies.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.567 align:middle line:84%

be the greatest discovery

01:02:39.567 --> 01:02:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in the history of science.

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.100 align:middle line:90%
NASA would be elated, of course.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.017 align:middle line:84%
They could go to Congress
to get more funding.

01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Why would anybody cover this up.

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's do this other little
thought experiment, everybody.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.250 align:middle line:10%
>> So are you going to do this
with baking soda and vinegar,

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.050 align:middle line:10%
Bill?

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1952, Project Blue Book
was launched by the US Air

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Force to allay fears from
the public of ET activity,

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and to assure them that
they were doing everything

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
in their power to
look into this.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force interest
in this problem

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
has then due to our
feeling of an obligation

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
to identify and analyze to the
best of our ability anything

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in the air that may have the
possibility of threat or menace

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a decision made
within the national security

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
state infrastructure to ridicule
and dismiss cases that they

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
know positively are cases
of genuine sightings of UFOs

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.890 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial beings.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.960 align:middle line:90%
That's perfectly clear.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Project Blue Book was headed
up by Dr. J. Allen Hynek,

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
a professor of physics and
astronomy at Ohio State

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:57.450 align:middle line:90%
University.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And Hynek eventually
came clean and said,

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
we were there to
debunk these cases,

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
not to get to the truth
and tell the public.

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And I know the job they had.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:12.240 align:middle line:10%
They were told not
to excite the public.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't rock the boat.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And I saw it in my
own eyes happen,

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that whenever a case happened
that they could explain,

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
which is quite a few,
they made a point of that

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and left that out to the media.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Cases that were very
difficult to explain,

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
they would jump the handsprings
to keep the media away

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
from that.

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
They had a job to do, to
keep the public from getting

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
excited.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> However, there have been
a certain percentage of this

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
volume of reports that have
been made by credible observers

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
of relatively incredible things.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It is this group of
observations that we now

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.740 align:middle line:90%
are attempting to resolve.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In response to
Project Blue Book,

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
an academic committee was formed
in 1953 called the Robertson

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Panel.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.580 align:middle line:10%
Comprised of some of the
most respected physicists

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.550 align:middle line:10%
and astronomers of the
day, the Robertson Panel

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:11.250 align:middle line:10%
was tasked with providing
a fair and independent

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:15.480 align:middle line:10%
academic analysis of
the UFO case files.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.040 align:middle line:10%
>> And in this document it says
point blank that the people who

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.280 align:middle line:10%
are on this committee are
answering and working with

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.830 align:middle line:10%
the CIA, but that
can't be disclosed.

01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And these are
esteemed scientists

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
in academic university settings.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
It says point
blank, when there's

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
a very strong piece of evidence,
we need to set up something.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.270 align:middle line:10%
So we release certain
type of balloons and film

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:43.230 align:middle line:10%
it so that it will look like
that to sort of debunk it.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.900 align:middle line:10%
And we need to
engage astronomers

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.470 align:middle line:10%
and amateur astronomers and set
up a sighting situation where

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:middle line:10%
we show them some
evidence, and then

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.220 align:middle line:10%
show them how it's debunked.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Fast forward to 1968.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:59.440 align:middle line:10%
The Condon Committee
was formed, led by Dr.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Edward Condon, a
professor of physics

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.120 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Colorado.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, ostensibly, this was
an objective scientist who was

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
heading up a committee
to tell the truth,

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.460 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a scientist.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
These guys are
scientists second.

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:16.360 align:middle line:90%
They're humans first.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And it says it cannot be allowed
to be known that Doctor Condon

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
et. al are actually working with
the CIA for these psychological

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.900 align:middle line:90%
warfare and spin factors.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I concluded that this
was not an objective study.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:36.640 align:middle line:10%
So I wrote a letter to Condon.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was so furious at
that that he called up

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
James S. McDonnell,
who was at that time

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the chairman of the newly-merged
Douglas and McDonnell aircraft

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
companies, and tried
to get me fired.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> This is in these documents.

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It is-- this is not
a theoretical case.

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say, you
form a committee when

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.160 align:middle line:90%
you want to kill something.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> "I must admit that any
favorable mention of the flying

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
saucers by a scientist
amounts to extreme heresy,

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and places the one making
the statement in danger

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
of excommunication by the
scientific theocracy."

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:18.078 align:middle line:90%
Frank B Salisbury, PhD.

01:07:18.078 --> 01:07:20.568 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:07:20.568 --> 01:08:37.760 align:middle line:90%


01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.399 align:middle line:84%
>> And from the very first
meeting I had with the director

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.649 align:middle line:84%
of Central Intelligence, I
didn't need to convince him

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:44.210 align:middle line:90%
that the UFOs were real.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.359 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I pulled out
all this dispositive evidence

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.399 align:middle line:84%
that Carl Sagan
would want to see.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I already
know this is real.

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But I want to know why I, the
CIA director, James Woolsey,

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and the President
of the United States

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
aren't being told
anything about it.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:04.899 align:middle line:84%
The why is always the
hardest question to ask,

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and nobody asks it.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I began to explain
to him what it really

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
is it's a big
technological question.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:20.180 align:middle line:90%


01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.189 align:middle line:84%
>> We have lost 100 years of
evolution on planet Earth,

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:27.890 align:middle line:90%
a true lost century.

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.830 align:middle line:10%
Huge progress was
made in the 1920s

01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:34.880 align:middle line:10%
as Nikola Tesla developed energy
generation technologies that

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.470 align:middle line:10%
could power the Earth,
drawing endless free energy

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:43.490 align:middle line:10%
from the so-called
empty space around us.

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The so-called empty space
isn't really empty at all.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.979 align:middle line:10%
It's actually full of energy.

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:52.490 align:middle line:10%
So instead of being, like,
kind of a quiet empty lake,

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:54.690 align:middle line:10%
it's more like the froth
of the base of a waterfall

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.490 align:middle line:10%
or something.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:59.600 align:middle line:10%
>> The amount of energy in a
cubic meter of space time was

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.380 align:middle line:10%
10 to the 26th power-- that's
a 10 with 26 zeros behind it--

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.520 align:middle line:10%
joules per cubic meter.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's enough energy,
even in a coffee cup,

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to boil all the
oceans of the Earth

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.250 align:middle line:90%
completely away into steam.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The acronym Unidentified
Flying Object is a deliberately

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.380 align:middle line:90%
obfuscating term.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And what it really is,
is an alternative energy

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.190 align:middle line:90%
and propulsion system.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> They had a piece that
they thought was Plexiglas,

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
a rectangular
piece of Plexiglas,

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:29.930 align:middle line:84%
for years before they figured
out it was the energy device

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:30.770 align:middle line:90%
for the craft.

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was connected
in such a manner

01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
that this device could power a
very small watch up to a city.

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Power was determined by
what the demand on it was.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And so each craft
had one of these.

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:47.960 align:middle line:10%
>> The implications of free
energy go far beyond keeping

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.200 align:middle line:10%
the lights on in your home
or running your car without

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.060 align:middle line:10%
gasoline.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Most of the cost
of making anything,

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
from growing food to
constructing a skyscraper,

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
is the energy used to
mine the raw materials out

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
of the ground, ship,
process, ship again, package,

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and deliver.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
A free energy society in which
the cost of manufacturing

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and agriculture
move towards zero

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
would mean endless abundance
for everyone on Earth.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> They already exist.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they even
have to be invented.

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You and I, the
taxpayers, have already

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
paid trillions of
dollars, literally,

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
in super secret
black budget funding,

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.790 align:middle line:90%
to develop these systems.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:39.950 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the society we
could have had a century ago.

01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> We could get rid of smog.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.100 align:middle line:90%
We could get rid of pollution.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.690 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even need
solar panels at this point.

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:49.250 align:middle line:10%
We could change transportation
in a microsecond.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:52.220 align:middle line:10%
The way we build homes would
be completely different.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
The way we govern our lives
would be completely different.

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And all the literally
hundreds of trillions

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
of dollars in assets that are
in coal, natural gas, uranium,

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:05.752 align:middle line:84%
nuclear power, public
utilities, they're all obsolete.

01:12:05.752 --> 01:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Many people would say,
well, doesn't that

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.082 align:middle line:84%
mean the secrecy's
been a good thing?

01:12:09.082 --> 01:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, that would be like
saying we should have never

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
come out with the automobile
because the horse and buggy

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
manufacturers would have
gone out of business.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Or come out with computers
because Royal typewriters

01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
didn't get ahead of the curve
and they went out of business.

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go outside
and we look at our cars,

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.200 align:middle line:84%
we look at our airplanes, we're
already looking at dinosaur

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.250 align:middle line:90%
technology.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It's laughable where
we are right now.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
We should be at
least 100 years ahead

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:34.370 align:middle line:90%
of where we are right now.

01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are still files
on this issue classified top

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
secret from 100 years
ago for the same reasons.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.100 align:middle line:10%
Because the macroeconomic
order of fossil fuels,

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.900 align:middle line:10%
the petrodollar, a handful
of industrial elites,

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.570 align:middle line:10%
and corporations would be
completely transformed.

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But the folks who
actually call the shots

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
in the multi-trillion
dollar global economy,

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
see that happen.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> They know that if that power
was delineated to the average

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
person, we wouldn't
need them anymore.

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't want it today.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And the likes of JP
Morgan and others

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
back 100 years ago
didn't want it.

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:16.820 align:middle line:10%
>> When they found out
that Tesla had passed away

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.850 align:middle line:10%
in the Hotel New
Yorker, they came in.

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:24.050 align:middle line:10%
They had the manager of
the hotel open the safe.

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:26.117 align:middle line:84%
And they took all
of Tesla's papers.

01:13:26.117 --> 01:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was to the director
of the FBI from the Department

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
of Defense in a turf war
trying to get that information

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and lock it up.

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
contested document.

01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
This has been
officially released.

01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> A century of artificial
scarcity has produced

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
a destabilized,
dehumanized war torn world,

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
where the power and wealth have
been transferred from the many

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:53.340 align:middle line:90%
to the hands of the few.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take that on, you're
going to run into the mother

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of all buzz saws in terms of
the national security state.

01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the breakthroughs in
the past have been deliberately

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:04.370 align:middle line:90%
suppressed.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>> There were 5,135,
I believe it is,

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:11.630 align:middle line:10%
patents that have been
confiscated under national

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.280 align:middle line:10%
security seizures.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, these are just the patents.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happened to
a lot of the huge breakthrough

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
technologies like Stan Meyer,
who had a car running on water.

01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>> A local inventor has
discovered a way, hear this,

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.693 align:middle line:10%
to use water to run your car.

01:14:28.693 --> 01:14:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a major breakthrough
that will no doubt make

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
motorists happy.

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And as Ralph Robinson
explains, the Pentagon

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
is also showing lots of
interest in this project.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people don't realize
that Stan Meyer had a toroidal,

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
a donut-shaped object, that put
out many times more energy than

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.142 align:middle line:84%
you had to put into it because
it was tapping into this zero

01:14:49.142 --> 01:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
point quantum
vacuum energy field.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
That had a national
security order on it

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%
before he even got it to patent.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It was seized and shut down.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.540 align:middle line:10%
>> What we really had was
a threat to the scientific

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.530 align:middle line:10%
establishment.

01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I view this as the greatest
strategic threat to survival

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, and in
fact, of civilization itself.

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's going to stop
this from happening?

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The president doesn't
know it's occurring.

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The Congress
oversight committees

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.070 align:middle line:90%
have no idea what's going on.

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have these
people who are

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
in the deep national
security state who

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.710 align:middle line:90%
basically do what they want.

01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The problem is most
of these inventors

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
think that the world is going
to beat a path to their door.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
Murder, Incorporated

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
beats a path to
their door first.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But free energy
technology was only one half

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of the equation when it came
to advanced extraterrestrial

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:42.710 align:middle line:90%
technology.

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:45.720 align:middle line:90%


01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Early research into
antigravity technology

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
gained momentum in the
1940s, as Adolf Hitler

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
poured tremendous resources into
developing his secret weapon,

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:59.970 align:middle line:90%
the so-called flying bell.

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Once we acquired
these technologies,

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
they were augmented
with the study

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
of retrieved
extraterrestrial craft.

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And we created our own fleet
of so-called alien reproduction

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.610 align:middle line:90%
vehicles.

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This was where Bell
Labs was involved.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
This was where General
Electric was involved.

01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
This was where a number
of high tech companies

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.960 align:middle line:90%
gained their knowledge.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Lockheed Martin Skunk Works,
and EG&G, and Raytheon,

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and eSystems, and Mitre
Corporation, and Booz Allen

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Hamilton, and on and on and on.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I know many people who've
worked in these programs.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have things flying in
the Nevada desert that are 50

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
years beyond what
you could comprehend.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen it on
Star Wars or Star Trek,

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
we've been there, done that,
or decided it wasn't worth

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:49.370 align:middle line:90%
the effort.

01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:50.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's coming from Ben Rich.

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Ben Rich, head of the Skunk
Works between 1975 and 1991.

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the original letter from
Ben Rich on Lockheed Advanced

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Aeronautics Company letterhead.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:03.270 align:middle line:10%
"I am a believer, and
so is Kelly Johnson."

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And here it says, "dear Ben,
there are two categories.

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:11.100 align:middle line:84%
A, man-made UFOs, B,
extraterrestrial UFOs."

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.610 align:middle line:84%
"Dear John, yes, I'm a
believer in both categories.

01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:16.720 align:middle line:10%
I feel everything is possible.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of our man-made UFOs
were unfunded opportunities.

01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:23.950 align:middle line:10%
In both categories, there are
lots of kooks and charlatans.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:24.750 align:middle line:10%
Be cautious.

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:25.590 align:middle line:10%
Ben Rich."

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:29.490 align:middle line:10%
>> "We now have the
technology to take ET home."

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:33.300 align:middle line:10%
Ben Rich, CEO,
Lockheed Skunk Works.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>> It is being covered up, but
probably not for the reasons

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.800 align:middle line:10%
you might think.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the
intelligence communities,

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
they have something called
ace in the hole technologies.

01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So secret they didn't
even talk about it.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> November 12th of 1988
was their dog and pony show,

01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:54.433 align:middle line:84%
a classified military exhibit
at Norton Air Force Base.

01:17:54.433 --> 01:17:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And then off in a separate
section of the hangar behind

01:17:56.850 --> 01:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
a curtain, which was opened
up once everyone had gathered,

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
were three of these so-called
alien reproduction vehicles

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.170 align:middle line:90%
or ARVs.

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The craft itself was hovering
off the floor with no landing

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:09.810 align:middle line:10%
gear underneath it, nothing
supporting it from above.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:13.830 align:middle line:10%
To see something travel
across 12 miles of airspace

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:16.650 align:middle line:10%
in under a second and a half,
make a couple of right angle

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:21.090 align:middle line:10%
turns, and not make a supersonic
shockwave of any kind,

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.190 align:middle line:10%
no sonic boom, which
I've personally

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:25.860 align:middle line:10%
witnessed on a number of
occasions, I mean, it's just--

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.720 align:middle line:10%
it changes your
whole perspective.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> There were some
very good folks,

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.970 align:middle line:84%
like Secretary Forrestal, and
others who wanted to bring

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
the subject out but in a way
where there would be contact

01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that would be peaceful between
humans and these civilizations.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But there were
other people who saw

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:47.470 align:middle line:84%
the big goldmine of
militarism and war

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
profiteering and the
psychological warfare value.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Their mandate, repeat,
their mandate is to lie, deny,

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.470 align:middle line:90%
and deceive.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people who've had
experiences with the technology

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that were not able to
handle it psychologically,

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
because it just,
it defies reality.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:11.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And in this document, the CIA
director, Walter Smith, says,

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:14.800 align:middle line:10%
"I am today transmitting to
the National Security Council

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.250 align:middle line:10%
a proposal in which it is
concluded that the problems

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.800 align:middle line:10%
connected with unidentified
flying objects appear to have

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.030 align:middle line:10%
implications for
psychological warfare as well

01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:27.400 align:middle line:10%
as for intelligence
and operations."

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take a step back
from all the jargon and all

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the paranoia and "Star Wars"
movies for just a minute,

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and realize that it's very
easy to set up a false flag

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
operation.

01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> A false flag operation, also
known as a false indication

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and warning, is a military
tactic in which you create

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.900 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of a threat,
often by attacking yourself

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.510 align:middle line:90%
and blaming the desired entity.

01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:02.350 align:middle line:10%
It's proven extremely
effective at uniting the public

01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:05.580 align:middle line:10%
around a perceived threat.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is actually a
well-known concept in military

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.590 align:middle line:90%
intelligence circles.

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We did it in the Gulf
of Tonkin in Vietnam,

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
where we exaggerated, if
not completely staged,

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
an attack on our Naval vessels
so we would stampede President

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Johnson and the Congress into
vastly expanding the Vietnam

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.460 align:middle line:90%
conflict to benefit, guess who?

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
The military industrial
complex and the war profiteers.

01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.430 align:middle line:10%
>> US military
officials, for example,

01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:36.030 align:middle line:10%
have planned through a project
called Operation Northwoods

01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:41.940 align:middle line:10%
back in 1962, to dress up Cuban
refugees in Cuban military

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.910 align:middle line:10%
uniforms, have them
attack Guantanamo base,

01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:49.260 align:middle line:10%
and kill US military personnel,
sink US military ships,

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.070 align:middle line:10%
and blow up shopping centers
in Miami, targeting--

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:57.240 align:middle line:10%
killing refugees from Cuba,
to infuriate the American

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.530 align:middle line:10%
population so that they
can invade and occupy Cuba.

01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's astonishing
that anybody would

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
dare to make a
recommendation like that.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.540 align:middle line:90%
But they did.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You can look at Iraq.

01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Concocted all kinds
of false information

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
about weapons of
mass destruction,

01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
which Saddam Hussein
did not have.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was known in intelligence
circles he didn't have.

01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Fracture that whole part of the
world, and now we have ISIS.

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have to realize the
machinations and manipulations

01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that go on behind the scenes
leave us very vulnerable.

01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the big one is this
one, where they could say,

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
oh, yes, the UFOs are real.

01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They're a threat, and we
need to unite the world,

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.790 align:middle line:84%
like Will Smith said in the
original "Independence Day".

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Something you want to add to
this briefing, Captain Hiller?

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No, sir.

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a little anxious
to get up there and whoop

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.000 align:middle line:90%
ET's ass, that's all.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right on.

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Efforts on the part of a
certain element within the kind

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
of ruling structures of our
planet to try to utilize

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of
extraterrestrial intelligence

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
as an ultimate threat, the
ultimate other bad guys,

01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
to justify the national security
state dream of locking down

01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and putting under complete
control of an authoritarian

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.910 align:middle line:84%
ruling class to control the
planet and the resources.

01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> "The nations of the
world will have to unite,

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
for the next war will be
an interplanetary war.

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
The nations of the
Earth must someday

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
make a common front
against attack

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.380 align:middle line:90%
by people from other planets."

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.900 align:middle line:90%
General Douglas MacArthur.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you realize that we,
that you and I, that all of us,

01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
have actually begun the
exploration of another world?

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:46.175 align:middle line:84%
We have taken the first historic
step into our solar system.

01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:49.830 align:middle line:90%


01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.710 align:middle line:90%
I am Wernher Von Braun.

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:56.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Wernher Von Braun was one
of the top scientists brought

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.480 align:middle line:10%
to the US from Germany
after World War II.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
As part of Operation
Paperclip, he

01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
invented the V2 rocket
for Adolf Hitler,

01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and became the chief architect
of the Saturn V rocket

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.830 align:middle line:90%
for NASA's Apollo moon missions.

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
In his deathbed confession,
Von Braun warned of a plot

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to pull off the ultimate
false flag using back

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
engineered alien reproduction
vehicles to stage

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.290 align:middle line:90%
an invasion from outer space.

01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:32.790 align:middle line:10%
>> When Von Braun was dying in
front of me the very first day

01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:36.900 align:middle line:10%
that I met him, he had tubes
draining out of his side.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.730 align:middle line:10%
And he was tapping on
the desk telling me,

01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:40.110 align:middle line:10%
you will come to Fairchild.

01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.030 align:middle line:10%
I was a schoolteacher.

01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:43.860 align:middle line:10%
"You will come to Fairchild.

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And you will be responsible for
keeping weapons out of space."

01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:49.775 align:middle line:84%
The strategy that Wernher
Von Braun taught me

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.150 align:middle line:84%
was that first,
the Russians were

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:52.567 align:middle line:84%
the enemy against
whom we're going

01:23:52.567 --> 01:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
to build space-based weapons.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.960 align:middle line:10%
Then terrorists
would be identified.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.310 align:middle line:10%
Then we were going to identify
third-world country crazies.

01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:02.190 align:middle line:90%
The last card is the alien card.

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And all of it, he
said, is a lie.

01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:07.650 align:middle line:90%
A lie.

01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:12.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Have you been exposed or did
you come across in your career

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:18.330 align:middle line:10%
and your network the False I&W
or the deceptive indication

01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:22.350 align:middle line:10%
or warnings projects
related to this?

01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:24.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:28.780 align:middle line:10%
>> And what did you
find out about those?

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.895 align:middle line:84%
>> That's pretty--
that's pretty hush.

01:24:30.895 --> 01:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I should
talk about that.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.430 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, that's why--

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:35.888 align:middle line:10%
when I briefed the head of the
Defense Intelligence Agency,

01:24:35.888 --> 01:24:38.110 align:middle line:10%
that was the main subject.

01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That is-- yeah,
that's very sensitive.

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's very sensitive.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I occasionally think
how quickly our differences

01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
worldwide would vanish if we
were facing an alien threat

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
from outside this world.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:59.410 align:middle line:90%


01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the only problem
with that is that if you look

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:07.360 align:middle line:84%
at the technologies that permit
for interplanetary interstellar

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.250 align:middle line:84%
travel, it's 1,000 times more
developed than a hydrogen bomb,

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:15.370 align:middle line:84%
which if we were to have a
massive exchange of nuclear

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:19.400 align:middle line:84%
weapons, would leave most of
all life on Earth extinguished.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, how could we
possibly have armed conflict

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.170 align:middle line:84%
with another planetary system
for more than a nanosecond

01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:28.030 align:middle line:90%
and survive it?

01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:29.770 align:middle line:90%
They know that we couldn't.

01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's a way of
manipulating the public.

01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The demagoguery of fear,
jingoism, false nationalism,

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:41.095 align:middle line:84%
and creating a
boogeyman out in space.

01:25:41.095 --> 01:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%


01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Were you surprised when
your daughter enlisted?

01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Not at all.

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.355 align:middle line:10%
She's a born leader.

01:25:49.355 --> 01:25:50.980 align:middle line:10%
I know I've been
taking orders from her

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.470 align:middle line:10%
since she was five years old.

01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:55.230 align:middle line:10%
>> So you don't worry about her?

01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course I worry about her.

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.470 align:middle line:10%
I fought in the war in
'96, and I know what

01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:00.300 align:middle line:10%
those things are capable of.

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.030 align:middle line:10%
But I know what my
daughter is capable of.

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:05.940 align:middle line:10%
And I know this planet is safer
because she's defending it.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:11.740 align:middle line:90%


01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>> They could pull it off.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They could definitely
pull it off.

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they
have the technology

01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:19.570 align:middle line:84%
to mimic the form,
fit, and function

01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:21.290 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial UFOs.

01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
They have the
technology, absolutely.

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
It's seamless and you can
never tell the difference.

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:27.613 align:middle line:84%
If they do have a
false flag invasion,

01:26:27.613 --> 01:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
use one of these.

01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the Hudson
Valley Boomerang.

01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:32.680 align:middle line:90%
This is 1982 to 1989.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Over 25,000 eyewitnesses
reported this craft.

01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They can use the saucers,
the cigars, the pyramids,

01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
the triangles as a
united coalition.

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they're
going to do it.

01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
150 to 172 feet across

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:51.830 align:middle line:84%
for the wingspan, which is the
identical wingspan of the B2

01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:52.630 align:middle line:90%
stealth bomber.

01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So the question
we need to ask is,

01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
was some of that $22.4
billion used on the B2 poured

01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.560 align:middle line:90%
into this program?

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same time frame.

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
When they power up and
when they accelerate,

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a spark
off a grinding wheel.

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And you could never
know the difference.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So if they want to do a
hoax an alien invasion,

01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:12.910 align:middle line:90%
they could do it.

01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And they could do it in a
way that's 100% believable.

01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> They started doing all
kinds of psychological warfare

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.750 align:middle line:84%
entrainment of the public
by staging hoaxed events,

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:28.000 align:middle line:90%
such as cattle mutilations.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's a flying
saucer did that.

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a covert paramilitary
program, human.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.980 align:middle line:10%
So if you wanted to start
indoctrinating people

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.980 align:middle line:10%
into a "false threat
from outer space"

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.630 align:middle line:10%
that Wernher Von
Braun warned us,

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:46.690 align:middle line:10%
about you would start staging
events that look alien,

01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:49.810 align:middle line:10%
but that are completely
man-made that are scary

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:52.090 align:middle line:10%
and scare the hell
out of people.

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> UFO encounters are
categorized into four groups.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Close encounters
of the fourth kind

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.940 align:middle line:84%
include people who
claim to have been

01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:59.770 align:middle line:90%
abducted by extraterrestrials.

01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:01.870 align:middle line:84%
If you had a close encounter
of the fourth kind,

01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and you are back, we're
anxious to hear from you.

01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:08.320 align:middle line:10%

these sort of antigravity

look like ETs that are actually

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:14.470 align:middle line:10%
man-made robotic systems.

01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:16.510 align:middle line:84%
They're called
programmed lifeforms.

01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And you start doing select
interfaces with the public.

01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> We did do that.

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.300 align:middle line:90%
OSI did that.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:31.150 align:middle line:84%
There was a special group out of
the 760 second year intel wing

01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:32.920 align:middle line:90%
at Fort Belvoir.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.420 align:middle line:90%
They came out and did that.

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
They had these people that had
maybe some sort of defects,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.238 align:middle line:84%
anatomical defects, that were
brought in to fool people

01:28:48.238 --> 01:28:49.530 align:middle line:90%
into thinking they were aliens.

01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I can't give you any specifics,
because the program is

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.560 align:middle line:90%
still classified.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And they probably
are still doing it.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't doubt if they
were still doing it.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So they've already got this
psychological warfare already

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
embedded into the minds
of people to expect

01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:09.090 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial,
not a secret aircraft,

01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:10.120 align:middle line:90%
but an alien craft.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So when they do
pull this, they'll

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.280 align:middle line:84%
already have everything
ready to roll.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> These civilians got onto the
base, and got into something.

01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:20.910 align:middle line:84%
They saw something they
weren't supposed to see.

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:24.390 align:middle line:10%
And this group came out
and went into their home

01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:27.510 align:middle line:10%
and scared the dickens
out of them and--

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:28.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Staged an alien event.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The government will use the
extraterrestrial phenomenon

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
to cover their own
deep black programs.

01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the fight
that we're up against here.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it makes it out
through the movie industry,

01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and the UFO lore, and the
internet, and what have you.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.080 align:middle line:84%

this specter of a threat.

hostility.

01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question is, how are
the civilizations viewing us?

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Are they perceiving human
civilization as a threat?

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.100 align:middle line:90%

to our planet and each other,

the discovery that
we are not alone,

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that there are other living
entities, intelligent entities,

01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:14.460 align:middle line:84%
in this universe
or other universes,

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:16.240 align:middle line:90%
and that we aren't here alone.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.260 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge,
enormous discovery.

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's long past time
to open this up to the public.

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Give this information to
the young people of the world

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.485 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

01:36:26.485 --> 01:36:27.360 align:middle line:90%
They want to hear it.

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.560 align:middle line:90%
They want it.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Give it to them.

01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't hide it and tell
lies and make stories.

01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:33.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not stupid.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.000 align:middle line:84%
They're not young
men that'll panic.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.570 align:middle line:10%
>> UFOs are as real as the
planes flying over your head,

01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:43.590 align:middle line:10%
and it's time that the United
States government started

01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:45.390 align:middle line:10%
coming clean on
what it's all about.

01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:50.007 align:middle line:84%
Because there are very important
military and economic issues

01:36:50.007 --> 01:36:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that have to be addressed.

01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And how can you
address a question

01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
which relates to a subject
that people don't even--

01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:59.190 align:middle line:90%
won't admit exists?

01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's a mission that we,
as the Baby Boomer generation,

01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:06.330 align:middle line:90%
pass on to you.

01:37:06.330 --> 01:37:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Humanity is at a crossroads,
a choice between endless war,

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.760 align:middle line:84%
war in space, growing poverty
and environmental destruction,

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.140 align:middle line:84%
or a future where we
explore the stars,

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:28.480 align:middle line:84%
live in peace with each other
and our planetary neighbors.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The technology is there.

01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The solutions to Earth's
urgent and long term

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.560 align:middle line:90%
potential problems are there.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The technologies will change
the macroeconomic system,

01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:44.110 align:middle line:84%
because visualize for a
moment you're at your home.

01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:46.330 align:middle line:84%
All your power needs
are being provided

01:37:46.330 --> 01:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
from one of these zero point or
quantum vacuum energy systems.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Your car is running, never
has to be plugged in.

01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You then can have agriculture
and manufacturing locally that

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:01.340 align:middle line:90%
has very little cost to it.

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:03.637 align:middle line:84%
And this is not just in
the US, but in places

01:38:03.637 --> 01:38:04.720 align:middle line:90%
that aren't yet developed.

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The so-called third world
or developing world.

01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They're going to leapfrog right
over the smokestack industries

01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and go to high tech,
real high tech,

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.670 align:middle line:84%
just like they've skipped
over telephone lines

01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:17.200 align:middle line:90%
and gone to smartphones.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.600 align:middle line:84%
This will be a tide that
will lift all ships.

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The world will be increasingly
interconnected, and yet

01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
on the local level, be
completely self-sufficient,

01:38:26.530 --> 01:38:29.030 align:middle line:90%
every village, every home.

01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that is
the biggest change economically

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the human race.

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big nut to crack.

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if
you could do that,

01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that people would
stop looking at each other

01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:44.710 align:middle line:84%
with a certain level of
hostility like we do now.

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess it's kind of corny,
but it's that bright future

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
that I see that we could all
attain if just a few things

01:38:52.210 --> 01:38:53.140 align:middle line:90%
could be changed.

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine interplanetary trade,
how exciting that would be.

01:38:56.050 --> 01:38:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to adjust
your cosmology.

01:38:58.010 --> 01:39:01.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to adjust your whole
concept of our human species

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
being at the apex of
all biological evolution

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:04.990 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And you also have to, of
course, modify your judgment

01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that the entire universe was
created just as the stage

01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:15.010 align:middle line:84%
upon which the drama of the
human development is unfolding.

01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more going on in
the universe than just that.

01:39:17.710 --> 01:39:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why it's time for the
people to lead the whole ending

01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:25.660 align:middle line:84%
of the secrecy and
do the disclosure.

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> As we, the human family,
confront the reality

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial life, it is
perhaps worthwhile to reflect.

01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Was our doubt really due
to a lack of evidence,

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.134 align:middle line:90%
or merely a lack of imagination?

01:39:46.134 --> 01:39:54.532 align:middle line:90%


01:39:54.532 --> 01:39:57.002 align:middle line:90%

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to Area 51
and whether or not the US

01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:21.000 align:middle line:84%
government knows of aliens,
should Secretary Clinton be

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:21.870 align:middle line:90%
elected president?

01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:23.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I've talked
to the secretary about,

01:40:23.912 --> 01:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and what she said now in
public, is that if she's elected

01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:29.550 align:middle line:84%
president, when she
gets into office,

01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:33.990 align:middle line:84%
she'll ask for as many records
as the United States federal

01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
government has to
be declassified.

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I that's a commitment
that she intends to keep,

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.693 align:middle line:84%
and that I intend
to hold her to.

01:40:40.693 --> 01:40:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you seen any
of these documents?

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.277 align:middle line:84%
You were White House
Chief of Staff years ago.

01:40:44.277 --> 01:40:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, President Clinton
asked for some information

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.620 align:middle line:90%
about some of these things.

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, some
information about what

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.440 align:middle line:90%
was going on at Area 51.

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
the US government

01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:03.780 align:middle line:84%
could do a much better job in
answering the quite legitimate

01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:06.690 align:middle line:84%
questions that people
have about what's

01:41:06.690 --> 01:41:09.450 align:middle line:84%
going on with unidentified
aerial phenomena.

01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:11.705 align:middle line:10%
And they should-- you
know, the American people

01:41:11.705 --> 01:41:12.580 align:middle line:10%
can handle the truth.

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:15.415 align:middle line:84%
So they should just
do a thorough search--

01:41:15.415 --> 01:41:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the truth?

01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:18.555 align:middle line:84%
And is there evidence
of alien life?

01:41:18.555 --> 01:41:21.870 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, that's for
the public to judge once

01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:25.037 align:middle line:10%
they've seen all of the evidence
that the US government has.

01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think personally?

01:41:26.370 --> 01:41:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> What do I think?

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of planets out there.
