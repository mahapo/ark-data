00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.430 align:middle line:10%
>> When we started years
ago, after "What the Bleep"

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:10%
and people started waking up
to the idea that subjective

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:10%
changes, or subjective mind,
produces objective results

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:10%
in the external world, the most
common question we got was,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:10%
how do you do this?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you make those changes?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
If something's going
on inside of us,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's producing some
result outside of us,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
what is that process that's
going on inside of us

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:90%
that we could begin to measure?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And if it happens
once, it's an incident.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
If it happens twice,
it's a coincidence.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you start seeing it
happen three and four and five

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and six and seven times, now
you're looking at a trend.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at a pattern.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And anything that's
repeatable is science.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Chloe, where's your ear?

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Where's your head?

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Where's your mouth?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Where's your nose?

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
That's your eye.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Our daughter is
about to turn one.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And she was
exclusively breastfed

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:84%
until she was about six
or seven months old.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.214 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't know that she
had any sort of allergies

00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But she had eczema
for all this time,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't really know why.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.242 align:middle line:90%
Are you hungry?

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And about seven
months old, we decided

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
to start introducing
some formula.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And the first night that
we tried to give it to her,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
she kept batting it away
and batting it away.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And just shortly thereafter,
she vomited, and then

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
her face began to swell,
and her ears began to swell,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and she was covered in
a rash from head to toe.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And we went to
the emergency room

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and found out that she had a
really severe dairy allergy.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The eczema that
she was presenting

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
was actually from
foods that she was

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
getting passed through my
milk all along the way,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
before she ever
even had the dairy.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2007, my husband, he
committed suicide in jumping

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:90%
off a building in Amsterdam.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I was actually
a whole year stressed out,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:90%
in pain, emotionally upset.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:90%
I was angry.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
continue my life without him

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and the kids not
having a father.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
For three or four
months, I couldn't sleep.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
using alcohol.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I started drinking
two glasses of wine

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:90%
so I could get into sleep.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
But in the morning
when I would wake up,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
the whole emotional state in
which I was in at that time

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
was there, immediately
popped up again.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't relax.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:90%
But I kept on going.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And then one year later, a
Friday, I was at my work.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%
I was stressed out.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And then from one
moment and the other,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to two
colleagues, and then I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:90%
couldn't stand up anymore.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.775 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:90%
[SIREN]

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And they called immediately
emergency number.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I was taken
to the hospital.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
hospital for a few weeks.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
was really going on.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
They called it an
autoimmune reaction.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was released after six
weeks out of the hospital

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
without knowing the cause
of why I couldn't walk,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
without any really good
treatment, because they

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.745 align:middle line:90%
couldn't find the cause.

00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in two wars-- the
Persian Gulf War and the Iraq

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I found out I had PTSD.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And the VA's
response to that was

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
to use all these
different medications.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:84%
And having a doctor
of pharmacy degree,

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I knew that that would
just more or less

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
put a Band-Aid on what I was
going, through that I really

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
needed to get to the core trauma
to deal with those experiences

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:90%
that I did experience.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to find
a non-pharmacological way

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with the
emotions I was feeling.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So we took her off all of
the solids that she was eating

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and slowly started to introduce
foods one by one to figure out

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:90%
what she was allergic to.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was pretty
much everything.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
We felt really responsible
and felt really bad.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I did, because I'm shoving
these things into her body,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that she's
sensitive to them.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So just a lot of conflicting
emotions, a lot of guilt,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:90%
a lot of worry as a mom.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a constant
process of saying,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I'm just going to try
a little bite of strawberry.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And so there was all that
hope that would build up,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and then she would
have a reaction again.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And so then there was
the guilt afterwards,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.942 align:middle line:84%
like what was I thinking
trying it again?

00:05:30.942 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
When we went to the
doctor, they talked so much

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:90%
about her limitations.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
not a word that you

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
want to hear when it
comes to your kiddo.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I lost everything
in that year.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I was disabled.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
I lost my husband.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:90%
I went really down.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I got ulcers in my mouth.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I got the ulcers in
the certain epithelium

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of the mucus membranes in
the mouth and esophagus.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:90%
I was in constant pain.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually
the reflection

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:90%
of how I felt inside.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%
I was in pain.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
In January 2011, I got the
diagnosis of esophagus cancer.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I had two options--

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:90%
chemo or operation.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And the operation, I said,
I'm not going to take.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:90%
I just try first the chemo.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that will help.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
From the moment they
gave me the first chemo,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
my heart rate went up
to 200 and something.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I felt nauseous.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:90%
I felt so awful.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Then I actually at that moment
already wanted to pull it out.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But they told me to keep
it going in because that

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:90%
would be the best thing to do.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But two hours later, I
said, I want this out.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
I want this out of my body.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So then they pulled
the infusion out,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and I walked out
of the hospital.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not going
to go back there anymore.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> If you keep the brain
sustained in the high level

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
of emergency mode, and the
adrenal chemicals are running

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
in the body, the brain wave
patterns that are created are

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.250 align:middle line:90%
no longer in rhythm.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:90%
They are no longer synchronized.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
They are dyssynchronized, or
disintegrated, or disorderly.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:10%
And that type of disorderly
pattern in the brain

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:10%
sends a disorderly signal down
the central nervous system

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:10%
and causes disorderly messages
to the rest of the body.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I had one huge thought, since
2007, I was carrying around--

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
my husband should not
have committed suicide,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and he should not have
left his children alone.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So these thoughts actually
created the stress

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
in my body, the
anger, the sadness.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, my god, how could
he have done this?

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at the depression
that we're seeing as a society,

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:10%
the anti-depressant medication,
there's a crying out there

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:10%
in the world right now
that people are in pain.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that
transformation is teachable.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a new
model has to be developed.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:10%
My intention in
this work is really

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:10%
to make it so simple and
provided in a language that

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:10%
isn't based on tradition, that
isn't based on culture, that

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:10%
isn't based on religion, because
I feel like those things tend

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:10%
to divide people.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:10%
>> What I'd like to invite
us to consider is to consider

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:10%
well-being as a skill.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:10%
One of the important
components of well-being

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:10%
is resilience, the capacity
to effectively cope

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:10%
with adversity.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Adversity happens.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And we are all
subject to adversity

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
at some point or
other in our lives.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And how we respond
to that adversity

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is a key attribute
of well-being.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I'm looking at
resilience as being the aspect

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
of what we'll call
my ebb and flow,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
that I have the ability just
naturally to flow in the river.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
You naturally go
around the rock.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
You naturally flow
into this tributary.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it turns out that we can
actually learn to become more

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:90%
resilient.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:10%
We can learn to recover more
quickly from a stressful event.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:10%
The evidence that we
have before us today

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:10%
really leads us inevitably
to this conclusion.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:10%
And if we all actually took
this conclusion seriously,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:10%
I think it would propel a
national and global movement

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:10%
for us all to take
more responsibility

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:10%
for our own well-being.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We are going to
start at 6 o'clock--

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.482 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:18.434 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:90%
You can sleep in at home.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Bring your body here.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.499 align:middle line:10%
You'll be so happy that you did.

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:10%
And always remember,
when you wake up

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:10%
in the morning at
5:00, or 5:15, or 5:30,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:10%
everything that your mind
is telling you is a lie.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:10%
Just remember that.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:90%
It is all a lie.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything we do
will affect our brains.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The environments that we're
exposed to, the way we behave,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the way we comport ourselves
all affects our brains

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are
constantly being shaped.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we take
more responsibility

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
for the shape of our brains,
if we instill qualities

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of equanimity and of
generosity and of kindness,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
our brains will change because
we adopt these mental habits.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And through that
change, we can produce

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
enduring changes,
enduring transformations,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
in our experience and behavior.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And the best ways
that we're learning

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that we can change
these habits is

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:90%
through meditation practices.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to
be a Buddhist monk.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
40,000 hours of meditation.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is understand how

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to hit the tennis
ball, that there's

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
certain steps you have to go
through to hit the golf ball.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:84%
There's certain steps
you have to go through

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to knit.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's four
kinds of meditations.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a standing meditation,
a walking meditation, a sitting

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
down meditation, and a
lying down meditation.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to begin to practice
the same process that you're

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:90%
doing sitting.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
stand up, and you're

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.158 align:middle line:84%
going to raise your
energy in your body.

00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:26.122 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:41.446 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.446 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>> When I first heard
about meditation,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:10%
I didn't believe that that would
work for me because I had these

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:10%
ADD, hypervigilant tendencies.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
My alma mater at the
University of Wisconsin

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
showed brain scans
from the Buddhist monks

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.975 align:middle line:84%
and how they actually
had a control study where

00:13:00.975 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
they brought individuals
off the street

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and showed them that they
could destress and calm.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first met His
Holiness the Dalai Lama in 1992,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
he challenged me.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, we've been--
we being scientists-- have

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:84%
been using the tools
of modern neuroscience

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
to study qualities like fear
and anxiety and depression.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we use those same
tools to study kindness

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:90%
and compassion?

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> He looked at all of
us young scientists.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:10%
And he looked at us, and
he pointed his finger.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:10%
And when he points
his finger at you,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to just dismiss
it as nothing, no big deal.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, I will be
watching all of you.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
You are responsible for reducing
suffering in this world.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
This is where this
mindful revolution,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
or inner revolution,
is happening.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:90%
It's happening now.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And we need
scientists to continue

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
to investigate, to show
the evidence for how

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
these practices can
be transformative,

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to be the best
human you can be--

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
not only for yourself, but
for all the people around you.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most
amazing things

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
about this
mindfulness revolution

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
has been how it's
actually pushed the field

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:90%
of neuroscience forward.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
People in the
neuroscientific discipline

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:84%
weren't thinking about
what a resting mind was

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.605 align:middle line:90%
and what it does.

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
The resting mind was used
as a baseline for everything

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:90%
else that was of interest.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But now what we're realizing
is that the resting mind

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.052 align:middle line:90%
is actually a quite busy mind.

00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:10%
>> People are hovering at
a level like this, I think,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:10%
just from all this environmental
input and stressors and things

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:10%
you're trying to modulate.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.797 align:middle line:10%
It's so important to just
take it down a notch.

00:14:43.797 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:90%
You're already here.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:90%
You're like a pressure cooker.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:90%
There's not much room.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So if your baseline
is down here, yeah,

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you can handle the
stressors up and down.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And you go back down
there, and you're cool.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But if it just adds up
and adds up and adds up,

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:90%
you can't tolerate very much.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very
pleased to be here

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and be able to share some
of this research with you.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So we call it mindfulness-based
cancer recovery.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, we train them
in principles of mindfulness,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.321 align:middle line:84%
as well as we do moving
mindfulness or gentle yoga.

00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a clinical service.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's open to all cancer
patients and family members

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:90%
that come through our program.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
When people have a traumatic
or difficult experience

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
like cancer, sometimes
it's a catalyst

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
for growth and transformation
and finding more sense

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:90%
of meaning and purpose in life.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And the program seemed to
have that effect as well.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
People reported being more
spiritual, meaning they

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of
connection with something

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:90%
larger than themselves.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:84%
We've been very successful
with this particular program

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:84%
over the last 15 years of
amassing enough evidence,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that now cancer centers
all around the world

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
are offering this program
based on that evidence.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's one thing that's
really great about the field is

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that it's opening new doors
of methodology and insight

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.081 align:middle line:90%
into how the mind works.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Bonk.

00:15:57.542 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So we had learned
these meditations.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
We went home, and
Chloe fell asleep on me

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:90%
for one of our naps.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just eat that time
up of getting to hold her

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.607 align:middle line:90%
and be close to her.

00:16:11.607 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So instead of putting
her in her crib,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:90%
I just let her stay there on me.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And while she was
on me, I meditated.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.225 align:middle line:84%
And I really just got into this
overwhelming state of love.

00:16:28.225 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even start with
the intention of thinking,

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to
heal my daughter.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:90%
It was much purer than that.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a lot of
intention besides just

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:84%
this overwhelming love I
was feeling connecting skin

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:90%
to skin with her.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.363 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
through the meditation,

00:16:42.363 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I was just in tears and thinking
about the abundance of hairs

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
on her head, and the
abundance of blades of grass

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that we've sat upon
and played together,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and the abundance
of times that I've

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
gotten to rock her to sleep
and to utter her name.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I just was
awash with emotions.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're truly present,
you forget about time

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
When you're truly
present, the hindbrain,

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
which is the factory for
all those stress hormones,

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
settles down, and
the forebrain begins

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
to silence the
rest of the brain.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're not distracted
by anyone or anything

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:90%
or any extraneous stimulation.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a volume control.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So getting people beyond
their identity as a body,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
beyond their identity as the
people they know and the things

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
they own, the places they
live-- getting them beyond

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
their association and
their identification with

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the external world or present
reality and getting beyond

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:90%
time--

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
is a skill.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
You're journeying
back to source.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get
excited about that,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.442 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you what
you do get excited about.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:50.358 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:50.358 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
The same level of
mind that you have

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:84%
been living from
every single day

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
in your conscious and
unconscious reactions

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to your external
world is not the mind

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that's going to produce
transformation in this room.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get greater
than the habituations

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
neurologically and biologically
in your brain and body.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to transcend your
identity that's connected

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to your external world.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have to literally
lose track of time.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And I call it digging
deep, because you reach

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:90%
a point where you hit a wall.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:84%
You reach a point
where you're caught

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
in a neural circuit
that's going around,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can't address
it from the circuit.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
You can't change a computer
program by being the computer

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.531 align:middle line:90%
program, can you?

00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:10%
You have to get into
the operating system,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:10%
and you need an operator
to change the program.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And that operator
is not your body.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
The operator is not the program.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:90%
The operator is not the ego.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we drop in the
meditation, we drop the body.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
We drop the physical.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
We go into that
deep subconscious

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
mind, the operating system.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the Divine
is waiting for us, saying

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:90%
come this way.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.655 align:middle line:90%
It wants us to interact.

00:19:08.655 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Mystics, shamans,
healers, sages--

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
they step into that altered
state of consciousness.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
It's our divine right
as human beings.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we will be randomly
selecting people in real time

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:84%
for meditations, where we'll
pull you out, and we'll say,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
it's time for you to
get your brain mapped.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to measure
your brain in real time

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:90%
during a meditation.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.384 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
what's taking place.

00:20:14.384 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And when a person is
struggling and when

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:84%
a person has transformation, we
want to see it in real time--

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
how different parts of the
brain are talking well with one

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:84%
another, how the front is
talking to the back, how

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:84%
the left is talking
to the right, how

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
different compartments are
all of a sudden synchronizing

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and holding hands.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.744 align:middle line:84%
And what syncs together
links together.

00:20:32.744 --> 00:20:36.202 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:36.202 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And that level of
orderliness that's created

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
causes the brain to function
in an integrated and holistic

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:90%
fashion.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And you start to feel more
like yourself than you've

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:90%
felt in a long time.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And that level of coherence
sends a very organized signal

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
down your central
nervous system.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
all other systems

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.419 align:middle line:10%
begin to organize
themselves as well.

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:28.353 align:middle line:10%
[CLICKING]

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So then as you start
opening your focus

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and sensing space
and nothing, as you

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
begin to unfold into
that infinite, vast void,

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
the longer you can linger
there as an awareness

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're touching and
tuning into a frequency

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
called the unified field,
which its signature

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is order and rhythm,
which is wholeness,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later
coherence is going

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.182 align:middle line:90%
to begin to consume incoherence.

00:22:07.182 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the brain will begin

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:90%
to become more integrated.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:90%

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The brain waves begin to
change from beta brainwaves,

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
high beta aroused
state, into alpha.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And in alpha, all of a
sudden the inner world

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
starts becoming more real
than the outer world.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And as your brain
waves slow down,

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden
you're connecting

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
to that autonomic
nervous system that

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:90%
wants to just do one thing--

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
create order and
balance in your body.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.846 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.846 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't know
anything about me.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that I had
PTSD, that I had ADD,

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that I had the
hypervigilance, everything.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
He could tell that
by my brain map.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it
was kind of shocking.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But it also gave
me a lot of hope,

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that
through this brain mapping,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:90%
I could measure my progress.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had the
objective measurements.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The brain maps showed me I could
actually go into my meditations

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and use that information
in my meditations

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:90%
to help starting to heal myself.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And all of sudden, you see
the front of the brain talking

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.031 align:middle line:90%
to the back of the brain.

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:90%
We've seen this so many times.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.585 align:middle line:84%
You see the right side
of the brain talking

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:90%
to the left side of the brain.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you see the brain

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
starting to move into
a more holistic state.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And those brain
waves become highly

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:90%
coherent when that happens.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
That energy moves
right into the heart.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the person starts

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to feel connected to
something greater.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I made a decision to
start meditating daily.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And I started the work--

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:84%
first on my own,
and then I started

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:90%
talking with people about it.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And they were supporting me.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I would start meditating
in the evening around 9:30.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I would sit with it
till I really felt I'm whole.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm having more energy.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm joyful.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy person.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It will work.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
All these changes that
I had to tell myself--

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
if not the chemo, then why
not try to heal myself?

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're stepping into
the practicum and the skill.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing to
study rodents in a changing

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing
studying people

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
changing their internal states
and being able to sustain

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
those internal states.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
practicum that leaves

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:90%
the philosophical behind.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have philosophy or
theory, and you initiate it.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
That initiation then
should lead to some type

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:90%
of mastery or skill.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happens internally
when the energy hits the head,

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.850 align:middle line:90%
there's light.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a very bright light.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:10%
You no longer need your vision.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But because you're human,
you're still trying to see.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to
describe what happens.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of light.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the current.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the blast.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the movement.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But you can't really
put a name to it.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> They are having an inward
experience that's greater than

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.790 align:middle line:84%
their trauma, their
diagnosis, their fear.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is happening
between their ears

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is more real than
anything that's happened

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:90%
in their external environment.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Her sympathetic nervous
system has switched on.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.142 align:middle line:84%
And instead of switching on
like being chased by a predator,

00:25:51.142 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
it's taking all that
energy stored in the body,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.664 align:middle line:84%
and it's driving
it up to the brain.

00:25:54.664 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes on, all
of a sudden the brain

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:90%
goes into gamma.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And she's aroused from
the inner experience.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's not from a
predator or from a danger.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It's from the Divine.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> On one hand, you
feel uncomfortable

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:90%
because it's unfamiliar.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But on another
hand, it was a joy.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You know that everything around
you and inside you is alive,

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's full of love--

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
just unconditional,
beautiful love.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine, 750
people in the room,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:90%
they're overcoming themselves.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And they start
activating this center--

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
their center of oneness, their
center of wholeness-- and as

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
the heart starts
getting coherent

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and it starts creating elevated
emotions like gratitude,

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
people are feeling the
emotions of their future

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that begin to create
holism and oneness.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:84%
If the environment
signals the gene,

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.885 align:middle line:84%
and the end product of an
experience in the environment

00:26:55.885 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
is called an emotion,
when you embrace

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
these elevated emotions,
you are literally

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
selecting and instructing new
genes ahead of the environment.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
turn on new lights

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and turn off old
lights, signaling

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.780 align:middle line:90%
new genes and new ways.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> During meditation,
my heart just opened up.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I was sobbing with joy.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was having these
waves and waves and waves

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:90%
of love and gratitude.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I can only describe
it as like a bolt,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.495 align:middle line:84%
like a lightning bolt of
energy arrived in my heart.

00:27:28.495 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come up through
the center or down.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It just came out through my
heart and up through my head.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very conscious of the
fact that I should don't expect

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:90%
to see anything.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, out of nowhere,

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I started feeling this
weird, strange shaking

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:90%
all over my body.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was getting stronger
and getting stronger.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are tears of
joy rolling down their face.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
They are being
baptized by the Divine.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs,
they feel so whole

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and so in love with life and
so in love with themselves,

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:90%
it's impossible to want.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
How can you want
when you feel whole?

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you
have everything.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment the magic
happens over and over again.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And there is a biological,
neurological, genetic upgrade

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in that person.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs, you will
feel so connected and so whole,

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%
you no longer
experience separation.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the heart is
in super coherence.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And when that heart
starts to beat in rhythm,

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and they are sustaining it,
all of a sudden, that field

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:90%
starts to expand.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:84%
That energy starts to become
very coherent, like dropping

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:90%
a pebble in water--

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:90%
after pebble, after pebble--

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.992 align:middle line:90%
and it's creating this wave.

00:28:49.992 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
how to describe it.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was this amazing energy
just went [DEEP EXHALE] right

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:90%
through me.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It was this crystal blue
white light that I saw.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Within seconds, my
ear clears, and I

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:84%
can hear for the
first time clearly

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:90%
out of my ear in three years.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I went back to
the neurologist.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Sue, out of the
eight lesions that you had,

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.770 align:middle line:84%
most of them have
completely disappeared,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and the rest have
significantly diminished.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was in nine months
with no medical intervention.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time he'd
ever seen it with somebody

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.617 align:middle line:90%
who hadn't taken any drugs.

00:29:25.617 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We saw people with
Parkinson's disease that had

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:84%
tremors, intention tremors,
pill rolling, shuffling gait.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's disease
is deficiency

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.274 align:middle line:90%
in dopamine in the brain.

00:29:34.274 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:10%
When there's not enough
dopamine in the brain,

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:10%
the upper motor neurons
can't communicate well

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:10%
with each other.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:10%
And it causes involuntary
tremors in the body.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Try as you may to control
it with your conscious mind,

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:90%
you can't.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So then what do you
see in the brain?

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:84%
You see all this
red, which means

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:90%
the brain is over-activated.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:90%
It's over-stimulated.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So then that over-activated
energy in the brain

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is sending an overactive
signal in the body.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And the body is experiencing
tremors, or spastic paralysis.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at this
person three days later.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you see much red
in that brain at all?

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no drugs.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:90%
There's no surgery.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no electrodes
placed in the brain.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They basically change
their state of being.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order for that
person to do that,

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:84%
they can't do it with
their conscious mind.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They've got to get beyond
their conscious mind

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and get into the
operating system where

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:84%
true transformation
can take place.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I got a gastroscopy,
and it was gone.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:90%
The cancer was gone.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what did it.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Just meditated-- I just
was there every day with it

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and seeing myself like
I'm a healthy person.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm fit.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:90%
I have a good life.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I earn money again.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm healthy-- that
was my main thing.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.760 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I
had to be healthy

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.300 align:middle line:84%
up here and especially
the emotions,

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because they are
sometimes so strong.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And the environment
is also like, oh.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have cancer,
the environment

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
reacts like you
have cancer and wow.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:90%
And they treat you differently.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And you even go and react
like that-- oh, I have cancer.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:90%
At one point, I stopped.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I told nobody anymore anything
about the condition I was in.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I stopped also talking
about my husband's suicide,

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
because I decided to not go
there anymore emotionally.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And that helped
me to heal myself.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So we did this series of
meditations over a couple days.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And one day I just turned
to Brian and I said,

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
Chloe is healed.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I just had this
mother's intuition.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:90%
99% of me believed it.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But there was still this 1% of
me that was really tentative.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So we just started
with some of the ones

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that she had had the
lesser sensitivities to.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And then just day by day,
we did it really naturally.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.740 align:middle line:90%
We didn't force it.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It was with each meal.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.698 align:middle line:90%
We just lived our lives.

00:32:06.698 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Chew, chew, chew.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I tried it.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I was making some
eggplant lasagna

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and gave her a little bit
of cream sauce on my finger.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course she loved
it, because it's delicious.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:84%
She kept eating more
and more and more.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I was watching-- not
really watching, waiting

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:84%
for a reaction, but just
more watching, just ready

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:90%
to wipe away that 1% of doubt.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:90%
She just enjoyed the food.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And there we were
in the kitchen,

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.385 align:middle line:84%
a family making a meal together
and eating a meal together.

00:32:41.385 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And it was a miracle.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you want a
drink, wash it down?

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My old thinking was that all
the things that happened to me,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:55.230 align:middle line:84%
I was a victim of circumstance
or of other people.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:84%
We, as a society
as a whole, we're

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
always stuck in the victimhood
of what happened to it.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And not to say that
those traumas weren't bad

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and that they weren't hurtful.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to come
out to the other side

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and see for myself, wow, that
has made me who I am today--

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
those traumatic experiences
made me the man that I am today.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I was a victimized person.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to not
be victimized anymore.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I decided at that point
I can go on living.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:90%
I can heal my life.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I finally will
enjoy my life again.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Leo, come here.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Come on, good boy.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:84%
In my meditations, I
thank my fear, my anxiety.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thank it for keeping me
alive, but telling it today

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't serve me.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's huge in meditation,
to be able to get out of myself,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.160 align:middle line:84%
get out of my body,
and use my brain

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to not give me the adrenaline
rushes that I'm so used to.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:90%
And of course, my body rebels.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:90%
It wants those fixes.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
It wants that adrenaline.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It wants the fear.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It wants that
because that's what

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.629 align:middle line:84%
it's used to-- so
using the meditation

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and actually visualizing
what it would

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.840 align:middle line:90%
feel like not to have that.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's rewiring
my brain to get

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:84%
into that mode
instead of the mode

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.128 align:middle line:90%
that I have been raised in.

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:27.116 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:27.116 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The research in mindfulness
and the brain is teaching us

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:05.100 align:middle line:84%
that through our own intentional
efforts we can actually change

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:84%
our brain through
purely mental activity.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of amazing,
because it suggests that we all

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:84%
have the capacity to shape
our own brains in ways

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
that may be beneficial.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And the research shows that
the more focused the person

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is-- in other words, they can
keep their mind on a single

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:90%
task--

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:84%
guess what it's
directly related to?

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Happiness.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Joy.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And the more fractured
a person focuses,

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
the more they are living
by those stress hormones

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and the more fractured
and confused they

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:90%
are in their life.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that I was
suffering of, which was

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
a physical condition
and emotional condition,

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:84%
a mental condition-- because
it's a three-dimensional thing

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that's going on--

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:90%
is that it's changed.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I walk again.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I have enough muscle power
to walk without crutches.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:90%
I bike again.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:90%
I do all the things I love.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I work again.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I look after my kids.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a happy person.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.321 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) The itsy-bitsy
spider went up

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
the water spout to ask the
universe, what's it all about?

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The stars in the sky
said, life is great.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So the itsy-bitsy spider
went home to meditate.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.006 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:39.006 --> 00:36:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Yea, we sang the spider song.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I think the coolest
thing has just been

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.190 align:middle line:90%
the joy quotient in our lives.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.287 align:middle line:84%
You think about this process
of manifestation and law

00:36:51.287 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of attraction, all
this kind of thing.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And you think about things and
stuff, and I want more wealth,

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and I want this.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:90%
We're normal people.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
We want that stuff too.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's beyond that.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:84%
We have just been more
joyful as a family

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and just more present with
each other and more connected.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every day we are
living our best lives.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.130 align:middle line:84%
That is just--
that's invaluable.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I wholly attribute it to
this time that we're spending.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.910 align:middle line:84%
We get up every morning
at 5:00 AM together.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And we sit side by side.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And we spend that time in
meditation before Chloe

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.160 align:middle line:90%
gets up.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten ourselves
into this state of mind

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.840 align:middle line:90%
that's blissful and joyful.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And we go into her room,
and we sing, and we dance.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.715 align:middle line:84%
And we have this whole
fun wake-up routine.

00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Good morning,
morning, morning.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It's time to start your day.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And you see it in her face,
just to start the day like that.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Imagine starting your life--

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:84%
every day, starting your
day with that much joy,

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:84%
with singing and
dancing and hugging

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and connecting and
smiling and just

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.700 align:middle line:84%
pouring your love
all over one another.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's the miracle.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:10%
>> We owe it to ourselves to go
out and try it and experience

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.880 align:middle line:10%
it.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:10%
And once you've
experienced it and feel,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:10%
like Kayla was saying,
the joy and the love

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:10%
that you can't help but
have and experience,

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.050 align:middle line:10%
that you won't want it to stop.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.810 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I've changed dramatically.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I went from this deep,
dark depression to now

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:90%
having a zest for life.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I am not as
hypervigilance anymore.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't use the sleeping
pills that I used to.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I now use meditation.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Is everything rosy today?

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I have things that
happen to me daily.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's how I deal with
them, and that is the key.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you're in that
state, guess what happens?

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:10%
You go from selfish, driven
by the hormones of stress,

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:10%
to selfless.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, that
heart of yours begins to open.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And the innate capacity in
you to give, to take care of,

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:10%
to nurture, to serve
is who we really are.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you create a community

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.300 align:middle line:84%
of people that are in
love with each other.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
the way that we

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:84%
survive is in cooperation,
no longer in separation.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.552 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Boop!

00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.430 align:middle line:90%
You did it.
