00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:10%
>> One might object that this
evidence is drawn from outdated

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:10%
reports, but what about the
recent discoveries in Africa

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:10%
that seem to clearly establish
the evolution of humans from

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:10%
ape-like creatures over the
past three million years?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
In 1978 at Laetoli,
Kenya, an expedition

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
headed by Mary Leakey
discovered fossil footprints

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:90%
dated 3.7 million years old.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Here is a contour map
of one of the prints.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists who
have studied the prints

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
declare they are
indistinguishable from those

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
of modern man.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
This three-dimensional
image was generated

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:90%
from the contour map just seen.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Could this print have been
made by a human being?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
To most scientists,
the answer is no.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the Laetoli footprints
are taken as evidence

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that Australopithecus had
feet like modern humans.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, Australopithecus is
said to have been fully human

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:90%
below its ape-like head.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But some scientists have come up
with quite a different picture.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The hand bones of the
Australopithecines

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
suggest to anatomical experts,
such as CE Oxnard, that they

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
were well adapted
to moving in trees

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.612 align:middle line:84%
in a manner similar to
the modern orangutan.

00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's compare the
blue silhouette

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Australopithecus hand
with the green silhouette

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.535 align:middle line:90%
of the hand of the orangutan.

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
The finger bones are strongly
curved in both hands.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's now compare the
Australopithecus hand

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
with that of the
chimpanzee in brown.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
The chimp's finger bones
are somewhat straighter.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we compare the
Australopithecus hand

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to that of Homo
sapiens in purple.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The human finger bones
are even straighter.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Hominoids with curved finger
bones, such as orangutans,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:84%
are very active in trees,
whereas human beings

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
with straight finger
bones are not.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that
Australopithecus was well

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
adapted to life in trees.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The hip bone of the
Australopithecine Lucy,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
now thought to be at the very
root of the lineage leading

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
to man, has often been described
as nearly human in form.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
This is also true of
the Sterkfontein pelvis,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
also from the Australopithecus,
shown here along

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:90%
with the human pelvis.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Note the similarity of the
upper parts, the iliac blades.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at these bones in
an orientation in which the hip

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
sockets are visible, we see
that the iliac blades are

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
set at very different angles.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Comparing the
Sterkfontein pelvic bone

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
with that of a chimpanzee,
we see in this orientation

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
that both bones
look quite similar

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and are both different
from the human pelvis.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
In frontal orientation, the
Australopithecus and ape bones

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:90%
look quite dissimilar.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The tentative conclusion is
that the Australopithecus

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
pelvis shares both strongly
ape-like and strongly

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:90%
human-like features.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Now let's turn to the
mathematical analysis of bones.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Measuring different
parts of the bone,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
one can represent
its shape as a point

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
in a multi-dimensional space.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Here, two measurements
of a human thigh bone

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
define a corresponding
point in two dimensions.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Relations between bones
of different species

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
can be studied by comparing
the corresponding points

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:90%
in multi-dimensional space.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider a study by
CE Oxnard on the ankle bones

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:90%
of various hominids.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Here is the ankle
bone of a modern human

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and that of an
Australopithecine, namely Lucy.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The distances
between the spheres

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
represent the
amount of difference

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
between the ankle bones
of humans in yellow,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
apes in green, and
Australopithecines in purple.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, the blue sphere
representing the orangutan

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:84%
lies among the
Australopithecines,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
which are distinct from both
modern man and African apes

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and not intermediate
between them.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Some have said that
Australopithecines

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are intermediate between
African apes and men,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
but this analysis shows them
to be in a domain of their own

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
with structural affinities
with orangutans.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
JP [INAUDIBLE] performed
a multivariate study

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of metacarpal bones from
the hands of humans, apes,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:90%
and Australopithecus.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
His studies showed that
Australopithecus' metacarpal,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:84%
purple, is not intermediate
between that of humans,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
yellow, and African apes, green,
but is morphologically unique.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Like Australopithecus,
Homo habilis

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
is shown in both
scientific studies

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and popular presentations
as having an ape-like head

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and a human body.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
This picture is redrawn
from an original painting

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.086 align:middle line:84%
by Jay Matternes in
"National Geographic."

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
According to the
studies, we have

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
considered this is
a misrepresentation

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:90%
of the evidence.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
This is confirmed by
a recent discovery

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
in Olduvai Gorge in Kenya
of the first associated head

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
and limb bones of Homo habilis.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Here is what Homo
habilis is thought

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to look like on the
basis of the new find.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And Australopithecus may have
appeared even more ape-like.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
In view of this, certain
human-like thigh bones

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
once attributed to
Homo habilis must now

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
belong to some other creature.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
These are at least
1.8 million years old.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that these
were actually human?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
This might also be true in this
very ancient and human-like

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
upper arm bone found
in Kanapoi, Kenya.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
In view of the great difference
between Australopithecus

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and modern man,
what kind of being

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
could have possessed
this arm bone

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:90%
four to five million years ago?

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Could it have been
the same being

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that made the human-like
footprints in Laetoli?

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Overall, the evidence
does not appear

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to support the view
that Australopithecines

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
were human ancestors'
intermediate

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
between the African
apes and man.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It is more likely that they
were unique creatures, rather

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
different from
both apes and men,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
but with some tree
climbing adaptations

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:90%
reminiscent of orangutans.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
A careful review of the
modern African evidence

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
reveals nothing that
detracts from the picture

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
of great human
antiquity presented

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
in the first part of this
film and even provides

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
some directly
supporting evidence

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
in the form of human-like
footprints and fossil bones.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But a great controversy
exists in the interpretation

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
of this fragmentary
African evidence.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The more intently one
studies it, the more it

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
seems like trying to receive a
desired image in a flickering

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:90%
mirage of possibilities.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
The origin of man's
cultural traits

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps even more
difficult to account

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
for than his
physical attributes.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
This led Alfred Russell
Wallace to doubt

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
the standard conception
of human evolution.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Born in England in 1823, Wallace
shared with Darwin credit

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
for the theory of evolution
by natural selection.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:10%
Wallace could not explain
by natural selection

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:10%
how people living in
simple tribal societies

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:10%
acquired intellectual capacities
as great as those of a learned

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:10%
Englishman of his time.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Wallace arrived at a heretical
conclusion, guided evolution.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
He postulated the
existence of subtle beings

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
capable of
intelligently directing

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%
the evolutionary process.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Darwin was aghast.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
He wrote to Wallace that,
by propounding such notions,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
he had literally murdered
their common child,

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:90%
the theory of evolution.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But years later in South
Africa, a similar heresy

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:90%
was propounded.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Robert Broom,
who had made many

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of the most important South
African Australopithecus

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
discoveries, also
concluded that there

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
was a hierarchy of several
intelligent beings guiding

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
the process of evolution.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
In light of the questions
that troubled Wallace,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
consider the following
strange story.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:84%
According to current
thinking, culture

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
remained at a very crude
level for two million years.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Even with the rise of fully
modern man 40,000 years ago,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
culture remained primitive.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Then about 7,000 years ago,
a radical transformation

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:90%
is said to have occurred.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
In the space of a few
centuries, civilizations

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
sprang into being
with the creation

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
of elaborate economic and
legal systems, architecture,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
fine arts, and numerous
technological innovations.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
In our own times, we find
that such developments

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.595 align:middle line:84%
are due to people with strong
inborn creative talents.

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The apparently
independent appearance

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
of civilization in
many parts of the world

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
suggests that such creative
drives are an innate feature

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
of Homo sapiens.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But how did these
talents arise and why

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
were they unexpressed
for at least 35,000 years

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
after the time of
the Cro-Magnon man?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Surprisingly, we find evidence
that civilization may not

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:10%
be so recent.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
The evidence for human
antiquity discussed so far

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
has all been published in
the scientific journals,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:84%
but now we shall cross
the boundaries of science

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and enter the domain of
general human testimony.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:10%
According to this
newspaper from the 1890s,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:10%
Mrs. SW Culp found a gold
chain within a lump of coal.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:10%
This coal is dated by the
Geological Survey of Illinois

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:10%
as being from 260 to
320 million years old.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:10%
In 1897, the miners at the
Lehigh Coal Mine in Iowa

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:10%
found a stone engraved with
identical bas relief heads.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:10%
The coal in this mine dates
from the Carboniferous period,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:10%
some 280 to 360 million
years ago, during which time

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:10%
amphibians were thought to be
the most advanced vertebrate

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:10%
life form.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
In 1862, the "LaSalle
Press" reported

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that in Macoupin
County, Illinois,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
90 feet beneath the
ground below two

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
feet of slate rock on a
coal bed, the bones of a man

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
were found.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The Geological
Survey of Illinois

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
dated this coal to the
Carboniferous period.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
The human bones would thus be
about 300 million years old.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:10%
In 1912, Frank J.
Kenwood found an iron pot

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:10%
embedded in a lump of coal at
the Municipal Electric power

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:10%
plant in Thomas, Oklahoma.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:10%
The coal came from the
Wilburton Mines in Oklahoma

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:10%
and is dated by the
Oklahoma Geological Survey

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:10%
to the Carboniferous period.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:10%
In June 1852,
"Scientific American"

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:10%
carried an article about
an exquisitely fashioned

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:10%
metallic vase blasted
from a solid rock

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:10%
in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:10%


00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:10%
The US Geological Survey
reports that this rock

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:10%
is pre-Cambrian in age,
over 600 million years old.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:10%


00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:10%
Such discoveries
continue to be made.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:10%
In 1968, several
metallic tubes were

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:10%
found in a Cretaceous chalk
bed in northern France.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:10%
The discoverers,
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:10%
thought them to be the
product of human work.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
The Cretaceous lies
between the Mesozoic period

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and dates from 65 to
140 million years ago.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
This evidence so
radically violates

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
current scientific
conceptions that it's

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
hard to make sense
out of it at all.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But we may gain greater
insight by considering

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
another area in which
human nature violates

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
standard scientific views,
the domain of the paranormal.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Although most scientists
reject paranormal phenomena,

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
others have carefully
investigated them.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:84%
One was Sir William Crookes,
the famous British physicist

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
who invented the cathode
ray tube now used

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.830 align:middle line:90%
in television screens.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Crookes became president of
the prestigious Royal Society

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
received a Nobel Prize

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
for his discovery of thallium.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Crookes began his
investigations in order

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
to expose fraudulent
psychics, but then

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:84%
became convinced of the
reality of psychic phenomena.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the psychics he tested
was Daniel Dunglas Home,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
a medium famous among European
aristocrats and literati

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
for the remarkable unexplained
physical effects that occurred

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
regularly in his presence.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:10%
With this apparatus,
Crookes demonstrated

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:10%
that Home could, by
touching his fingers lightly

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:10%
on a match box positioned
here, cause the scale

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:10%
at the other end of
the board to register

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:10%
six pounds of pressure.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
With a mechanical
disadvantage of about 20,

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Home would have had to exert
some 120 pounds of pressure

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
to do this, according
to standard physics.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And more extraordinary
experiments were to follow.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
People had often observed an
accordion play complex tunes

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
while Home held it with only one
hand, away from the keyboard.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
To ensure that Home was
not in fact manipulating

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the instrument by
sleight of hand,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Crookes constructed
a special cage.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
When positioned
beneath the table,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
the cage made it
impossible for Home

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:84%
to touch the instrument
with his other hand.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
As a safeguard against a trick
mechanism in the accordion,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Crookes supplied a brand new
accordion never seen by Homes.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Crookes reported that the
accordion played as usual.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.942 align:middle line:84%
Then Home removed his
hand from the cage.

00:15:13.942 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Crookes states, "I and
two of the others present

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
saw the accordion distinctly
floating about inside the cage

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:90%
with no visible support."

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Wallace reported a
similar experience.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
On several occasions,
observers--

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
including Crookes--
saw Home levitate.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
When Home levitated, he
claimed he was not doing it

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
by his own power, but was being
lifted by invisible sentient

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Levitation by
professional magicians

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
requires an elaborate apparatus
concealed upon a stage,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
whereas the levitations
by Home took place

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of crowds of
guests in private residences

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:90%
where he was a dinner guest.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We find well-attested
reports of levitation

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
from a variety of
times and places.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, in 17th century
Italy, St. Joseph of Cupertino

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
often floated into the
air, a phenomenon witnessed

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
by Pope Urban VIII, the Spanish
ambassador to the papal court,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and the Duke of
Brunswick, a Lutheran.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
"About these phenomena,"
Professor Challis

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
of Cambridge University
said, "the testimony

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:84%
has been so abundant that either
the facts must be admitted

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to be such as they are
reported or the possibility

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
of certifying facts by human
testimony must be given up."

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:10%
Anomalous facts connected
with the paranormal

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:10%
and the high
antiquity of man tend

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:10%
to be rejected by the
scientific community.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:10%
This reveals the working
of a knowledge filter

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:10%
by which people
preserve information

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:10%
compatible with their views
and eliminate information

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:10%
at odds with their views.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:10%
Science has carefully filtered
out all information connected

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:10%
with the paranormal.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But if we survey human
society in general,

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
we find abundant evidence that
such phenomena have occurred

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:90%
in almost all times and places.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:90%
Very widespread is shamanism.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
In trance, shamans
contact spirits,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
enabling them to
produce varieties

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal phenomena,
including psychic healing.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
A fundamental
element of shamanism

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and of many other traditions
ancient and modern

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is there is a soul that is
distinct from the physical body

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and which can travel
outside of it.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Some evidence for this comes
from modern medical science.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Physicians encounter reports
of out-of-body experiences.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
These typically occur
during heart attacks

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and other traumatic experiences.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Many people reported
observing their own body

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
from a vantage point above it.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Michael Sabom, initially
skeptical of such experiences,

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:90%
sought to confirm them.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
He requested heart
attack patients

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:84%
reporting out-of-body
experiences

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
to give details of their
exact medical treatment

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
during the time they
were unconscious.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
In the group that he studied,
enough people correctly

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
related details
of their treatment

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to convince Sabom that the
out-of-body experiences had

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:90%
indeed occurred.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Sabom questioned,
and we quote, "Could

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:84%
the mind, which splits apart
from the physical brain,

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:84%
be in essence the
soul which continues

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
to exist after the
final bodily death,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:84%
according to some
religious doctrines?

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
As I see it, this is
the ultimate question

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
that has been raised by reports
of near-death experiences."

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:84%
This leads us to the question of
transmigration, the transferral

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
of a conscious entity from
one physical body to another

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
at the time of death.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ian Stevenson,
a psychiatrist

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Virginia, has extensively

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
compiled reports
indicating people

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
are able to remember
previous lives.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Stevenson studied reports
by very young children

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:84%
not under hypnosis with neither
the motive nor the ability

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to invent elaborate
past life stories.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The reports of the
previous incarnation

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
often included details of the
person's habits, belongings,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and acquaintances.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:10%
In many cases, Stevenson was
able to verify the details

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:10%
and confirm that the
previous personality did,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:10%
in fact, exist.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:10%
As of 1988, Stevenson
had tabulated 2,500 cases

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:10%
from around the world.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:10%
881 of these were
thoroughly investigated

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:10%
and Stevenson was able
to verify the reported

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:10%
previous incarnation in
546 instances, about 62%

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:10%
of the total cases investigated.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Such extensive evidence suggests
that the human personality

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
can function outside
the physical body

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and even transmigrate
from one body to another.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that some
elements of human existence

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
are incompatible
with physical science

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and its evolutionary theories.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Such elements leave no
record in the Earth's strata.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Some insist, however, that
all paranormal phenomena

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
have been the result of
illusion and cheating.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, spirits,
levitation, miraculous healing,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
and transmigration

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
have been consistently
observed in human societies

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
all over the world for
thousands of years.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Critics argue that the
human mind everywhere

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:90%
generates similar delusions.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But if the human mind
is everywhere the same,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the power to discriminate
between reality and illusion

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
should also be widespread.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:10%
Must we assume that the
most intelligent people

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:10%
in nearly all cultures
have been utterly deluded?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:10%
According to many
human conditions,

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:10%
living beings can be
organized into a hierarchy.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:10%
Here a medieval
Christian picture

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:10%
shows the sensory
world at the bottom,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:10%
then the celestial and
intellectual realms inhabited

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:10%
by various kinds of
angels, and finally,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:10%
the eternal spiritual
domain of God.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The same idea of a progression
of ever more subtle inhabited

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
realms is also a part
of eastern thought.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric teachings
of the Jewish cabala,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
we find a similar
idea of a hierarchy

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:90%
of emanations from God.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
On the lowest levels
of such hierarchies

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
are power in the realms of
ghosts and earthbound spirits.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:10%
Many psychic phenomena
are attributed

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:10%
to beings of this sort.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Above the ghostly
spirits, there are

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
found various kinds of more
powerful intermediate beings.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Beyond these are
found the demi gods,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
who have control over
the forces of nature.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Also found here
are great souls who

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
work for the enlightenment
of all living beings.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Why have people
accepted the existence

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
of beings in this hierarchy,
such as demi gods?

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:10%
One primary reason
is that people

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:10%
have achieved definite results
by worshipping such beings.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, at
Lourdes in France,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
physicians have
reported hundreds

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
of miraculous cures of
diseased and deformed people

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:84%
who have bathed in the waters
of the spring connected

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
with an appearance
of the Virgin Mary.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Francois [INAUDIBLE],,
a French carpenter,

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:84%
had an extreme case of
varicose veins for 30 years

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and was declared incurable
by three physicians.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
One evening, he applied
compresses with Lourdes water

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:90%
to his legs.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:84%
When he awoke the next
morning, he found hardly

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:90%
a trace of the varicose veins.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:84%
In such cases, the
restoration of damaged tissues

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
seems to be brought about by
an intelligent agency operating

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:90%
outside known physical laws.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
This is relevant to the
question of our origins.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
If an agency can
restructure the human body,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
it may have constructed
it in the first place

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
at any time in
geological history.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
This may account for
the manufacturers

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:84%
of our anomalous stone
tools and artifacts,

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
which seem to keep
popping up in timeframes

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
far too old for accepted
evolutionary theory.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But archeology reveals
nothing about living entities

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
above humans in the
universal hierarchy

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary
theory requires us

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:84%
to regard the very idea
of such as an aberration

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:90%
of the evolving brain.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:10%
But this view can be
sustained only by ignoring

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:10%
vast areas of human experience.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:84%
These would include perceptions
of a supreme creator

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
at the root of the
universal hierarchy beings.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Plato presented the idea
of the supreme good,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate absolute cause
embodying within itself

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:90%
eternal ideal forms.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:10%
He further postulated a
demiurge, a subordinate creator

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:10%
who generates the material
domain by manifesting

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.335 align:middle line:10%
copies of these eternal forms.

00:24:33.335 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Turning to a completely
different culture,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
we find that almost all
Australian aboriginal tribes

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
believe in a high god, sometimes
called [INAUDIBLE] or Bunjil.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
This high god is
absolutely supreme

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and alone is creator
and preserver.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:10%
The Chinese have traditionally
worshiped ancestral spirits,

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:10%
as well as a
hierarchy of demi gods

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:10%
such as the goddess of mercy.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese believed in a wide
variety of intermediate beings,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:90%
including the celestial dragons.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese also worshiped
Shang Ti, the supreme ruler

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
in heaven, whose name appears
on this tablet in the Imperial

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Temple complex in Peking.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese emperor would
perform sacrifices to Shang Ti

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.040 align:middle line:90%
in order to ensure good crops.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
The American Indian shaman Black
Elk became a spiritual leader

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
after experiencing a vision
in which he was transported

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
into the presence of
guardian ancestors

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
from whom he received
instructions.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Black Elk saw all living
beings as the children

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:90%
of one supreme spirit.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual tradition
of India embodied

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
in the books of the
Vedas is characterized

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:90%
by many as polytheistic.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But in its pure form, it
is strongly monotheistic.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The supreme lord of the
universe, Jagannath,

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
is worshiped in this
famous temple in Puri.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Beyond this material
world, the Vedas teach,

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
there lies the Brahmajyoti,
the effulgence of the supreme.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And still higher, one
encounters of a variety

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.645 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual planets.

00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
These are predominated
by [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the abode of the supreme
personality of godhead Krishna

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:90%
and his eternal consort, Radha.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:84%
In hierarchies described in the
world's spiritual traditions,

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:90%
we find a common pattern.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
This common pattern is
delineated in detail

00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
within the highly developed
spiritual philosophy of India.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
The Vedic scriptures, such as
"Bhagavad Gita" and "Srimad

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Bhagavatam" describe the
supreme absolute personality.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:84%
He is the source of an
eternal spiritual realm,

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:84%
as well as innumerable
temporary material universes

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
inhabited by souls who
have fallen into illusion.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Each universe is brought
into manifest form

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:90%
by a demi urge lord Brahma.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Brahma generates material
bodies for the illusion's souls,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
beginning with the great
sages and demi gods.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
From the demi gods and sages,
the bodies of lesser beings--

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:84%
including humans,
animals, and plants--

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:84%
are generated by descent
with modification.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
This can be called
inverse evolution.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The modification occurs
quickly in a manner reminiscent

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of the rapid reconstruction of
the tissues seen at Lourdes.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
In inverse evolution,
an existing subtle form

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
systematically manifests
a gross physical form.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
This may be contrasted
with the generation

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
by generation accumulation
of slight bodily

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
changes postulated by
Darwinian evolutionists.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
The question remains, when
did human beings actually

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:90%
arrive on Earth?

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Sumerians
and Babylonians

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
held that their first kings
descended to Earth from heaven

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and that civilization was
given to man by the demi gods.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
According to the "Bhagavad
Gita," about 120 million years

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:84%
ago, Lord Krishna spoke
the Gita's message

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
to the sun god, Vivasvan,
in his residence on the sun.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Vivasvan then repeated
these instructions

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to his son, Manu,
the father mankind.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:84%
About two million
years ago, Manu

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:84%
passed the same instructions
to his son, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
who founded the dynasty
of earthly kings.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Beings from the sun
may have traveled

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:84%
by means of a vimana, or
a Vedic space vehicle,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
although they were capable of
more direct means of travel.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Such beings were the
progenitors of man

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and also the engineers of
the natural environment

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Given this scheme, humans may
have been created many times

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:90%
by such demi god progenitors.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the archaeological
evidence we've considered

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:84%
suggests that human beings
may have repeatedly populated

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
the Earth and manifested
typical cultural traits

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.870 align:middle line:84%
over a course of tens
of millions of years.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, the psychical
and anthropological material

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.960 align:middle line:84%
we've reviewed
shows that humanity

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.130 align:middle line:84%
may be part of a much larger
interplanetary system of life,

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
with its ultimate source in
an eternal transcendental

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:84%
This view allows
one to accommodate

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the totality of archaeological
and anthropological evidence

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.720 align:middle line:84%
available to science within
a systematic framework.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.570 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
Darwinian evolution

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.630 align:middle line:84%
requires one to kick
out vast quantities

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
of archaeological
evidence and to dismiss

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:84%
all paranormal and spiritual
phenomena as illusory.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, by its very
nature, the evidence

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
available to science does
not give certain knowledge

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
about man's distant past
and ultimate origin.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So it may profit us to
consider higher dimensions

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.410 align:middle line:84%
of human experience, rather
than confine ourselves

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to seeking answers to
these questions in bones

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and stones found in the
depths of the Earth.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:90%
