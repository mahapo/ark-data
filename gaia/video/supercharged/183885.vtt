00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Being supercharged to me
means that you have incredible

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.710 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.055 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a lot more energy
to keep up with my kids.

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:34.174 align:middle line:84%
>> That extreme pull, that's
my extreme, warm friend.

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if you get supercharged,
all the people around you start

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:90%
to get supercharged too.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Certain kinds of water is
not only good your health,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen evidence that
they can actually reverse

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:90%
irreversible pathologies.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:46.582 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We have 60 million
kids and young adults.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And the awesome
statistic is this.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
This could be the
first generation that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:90%
doesn't outlive their parents.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.487 align:middle line:84%
So now, instead of
longevity going up,

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:90%
now it's going to be going down.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.612 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.612 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of us are hobbling.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:90%
We're not moving the right way.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:90%
We're carrying extra weight.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:90%
We're sluggish.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
We're slow.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very obese,
severely obese.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I was over 320 pounds.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I was just really unhealthy
and very tired and sick

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> 20 years ago, chronic
fatigue syndrome wasn't really

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:90%
a recognized illness.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And especially things
like adrenal fatigue

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:90%
were just not ready heard of.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.348 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was only
22, and literally, it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
looked like my life was over.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew what to do.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, well, probably

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the best way of getting
over this illness is to just

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
climb and do loads of
exercise and hoping

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
all the fresh air and good
food and mountain exercise

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.962 align:middle line:90%
would heal me.

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could have been
further from the truth.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.785 align:middle line:84%
And see, if I'd known
what I know now,

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
because I was so strong-willed,
just pushing and pushing

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
actually just took me all the
way down to almost the boson.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like I had all this
willpower to try things and try

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and get out of it,
but my body literally

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the energy
to do anything with it.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Once I got back to
England, I started

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
this eight-year-long journey
of full-on bed-bound chronic

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.802 align:middle line:90%
fatigue.

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very difficult. To
see your son, who's a bouncy,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
healthy, active person
slipping downhill completely,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:90%
you felt completely helpless.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Our conventional
doctors just said,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
well, you've got this
virus, and we don't

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.901 align:middle line:90%
know what to do about that.

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:33.415 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So Sarah, how I went from
sickly sludge to supercharged

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is, firstly, I activated my
body's healing system using

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:90%
energy medicine.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But the second thing
I did was learn

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
how to use other sources
of energy outside of food.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.237 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'd like to know is,
what is the science behind how

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to use those other
sources of energy?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Because traditional biochemistry
doesn't really cover that.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to speak to
some experts in that field.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of people like
Professor Gerry Pollack.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There is so much evidence
that water is so central

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to everything that
the body does.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And then also
Dr. Steven Sinatra,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
who's written about
grounding or earthing,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and how you can get electrons
into your body through that

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What people don't realize
is that these vibrations are

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:90%
unseen forces.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And perhaps we can look
at other sources of energy,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
like light, movement,
those kinds of things.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'd also like to
do is go and meet a number

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
of biohackers who are taking
this idea of how to increase

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
their body's energy to
a whole other level.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Because although I've cured
myself of chronic fatigue,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have even
more energy so I'm

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.988 align:middle line:90%
able to achieve more from life.

00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And the first person I'd
like to go and interview

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:90%
is Dave Asprey of Bulletproof.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Because he was able to
go from obese and having

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
a low amount of energy
to now being pretty much

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:90%
a superhuman business machine.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The bottom line is, my
body is an amazing piece

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of equipment that is designed
to survive in the environment

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd also like to go and meet
Wim Hof, who is the Iceman,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and is able to climb up
Everest just in his underwear,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
which we would all
love to do, I'm sure.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They think they are not
able to go into ice water.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
[SHUDDERS] And that very
mind is crippling them.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And also Abel James, who
has got an incredible amount

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and is known
as the fat-burning man.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In every point in history,
the biggest mistake that

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:84%
societies in general have made
is that we know everything

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
right now, and we will move
forward based upon all of those

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
assumptions.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And also Ben Greenfield,
who is an athletic machine.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So when the light went off
for me was when I realized that

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
the way that I was training,
the way I was eating,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
my environment, everything
was not allowing me to have

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
the longevity that I wanted.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And then perhaps we should
also visit some laypeople,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
some people who are actually
putting all of these things

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
into practice, and see
how they getting on.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are some
incredible stories,

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
like Jeremy, who
has cystic fibrosis,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
but you would never
know, because he

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
does all of this rock climbing
and has a huge amount of energy

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:90%
for life.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I was born supercharged,
and I want to stay that way.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there's Kate
Towler and her kids,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
who has basically managed to
help reverse the autism of her

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:90%
kids.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Ryan, our son, has autism,
which makes the mix a little

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
bit interesting between the
weight loss and the autism.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And we also have Joe Polish,
who was originally a drug

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
addict, but has managed to
transform his life through

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
movement and exercise, and also
through changing his mental

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
habits.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And so somehow, I learned
that I can create my own

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:90%
internal power.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:90%
I can learn how to do this.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so once we've spoken
to some of our experts

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and our biohackers, we should
have a good idea of how to get

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
energy in the body, and
how to maintain energy,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and have that energy for life.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go and do it.

00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I have cystic fibrosis.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.067 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed when
I was four months old.

00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest
frustration is whenever

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.005 align:middle line:84%
they try to compare one patient
to another when there are so

00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
many things that are
different about us

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
that make up really who we are.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In spite of following
this advice from my doctor

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and traditional media so well,
I was basically in the worst

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:90%
health of my entire life.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are people still
so sick and tired?

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Why are people still
settling for mediocrity

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and just being free of
symptoms as a way of life,

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
rather than living an optimized
and supercharged life?

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.117 align:middle line:84%
A "one size fits all" approach
to health doesn't work.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:90%
We're all different.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
We're all genetically different.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Why is the medical
system so slow to take up

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:90%
this information?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> [GRUNTS]

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So the crazy thing is that
people will see, let's say,

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:90%
for example, a bodybuilder.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
They'll see a
bodybuilder on stage.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:90%
And the person looks good.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
They're our
society's expectation

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of extreme manliness
or extreme femininity.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But what it takes to
get that kind of body,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
at least the
stereotypical approach,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:90%
you take a closer look.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I did to myself.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
what's going on the inside,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:84%
you've got somebody who's
healthy on the outside,

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:90%
but they're dying on the inside.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> From a guy that
refused to sit in a box.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
My cubicle was killing
me, and I knew it.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.248 align:middle line:84%
When I was 16, I
took control and I

00:10:08.248 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
stopped doing everything
I was supposed to.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I learned then I can crash
the thing if I want to.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.002 align:middle line:90%
I started listening to my body.

00:10:15.002 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I definitely woke up
one day and realized

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
this is mine and nobody knows
more about it than I do.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.997 align:middle line:90%
I want to be moving.

00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to be working hard.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And everything about my
disease is about momentum.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not willing
to give that up.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.196 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
about staying ahead.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to
outsmart my doctors

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
or trying to make
them feel dumb.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I feel like
the tools that we're using,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are
in bottles and pills

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and IV bags, maybe those are
not the most effective ones.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I don't think medicine
is really there to get answers.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.272 align:middle line:84%
They're basically there to
keep people taking drugs

00:10:58.272 --> 00:11:00.480 align:middle line:84%
as long as possible, because
that's the only way they

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:90%
can maximize their profits.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.253 align:middle line:84%
I do think there is
a place for drugs.

00:11:04.253 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's acute care.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But I do think, for
chronic conditions,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
it definitely seems
to be failing.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:90%
For acute care, all good.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But most illness has nothing
to do with acute care.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctors, hospitals,
pharmacies, pills, medicines,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of shit making
us not happy, but unhappy,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:90%
and not healthy, but sick.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of us are led to believe
that our energy comes from

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know
that to be the case.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:90%
We eat and we feel energized.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:84%
However, that's not the
only source of energy.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So fundamentally, what
life comes down to is energy.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
We need energy for
everything we do.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:90%
We need energy to move.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
We need energy for motivation,
for passion, for thought.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.647 align:middle line:90%
So life is energy.

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:26.509 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't worry.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.371 align:middle line:90%
You're not turning red at all.

00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> [GROANS]

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> One more.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:90%
You've got it.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me, having a lot of
energy means that I can get out

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
there and do everything
that I want to do in life.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people that I certainly

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
see around me are sick and
tired of being sick and tired

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So to have that
energy in your life,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
really, for a lot
of people, it just

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
means that they can just
do all of the things

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that they haven't
been able to do,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
whether that is looking
after the children,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
getting further in their career,
whether it's just having time

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
at the weekend to do the things
they like instead of just

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:84%
crashing out on the couch
after a week at work.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So really, having that
energy, being supercharged

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:84%
is really such a
fundamental thing.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's in
everybody's reach.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
There are very simple
ways to get this energy.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Energy is the most important
building block for life.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when you
don't have any energy,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:90%
you can't really do anything.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:90%
You can't have a career.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:90%
You can't be happy.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
You end up diseased and ill,
which is what happened to me.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite of that is
when you have abundant energy.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
You have a super
lightning-quick mind.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:90%
You're much happier.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
You're able to flourish
in your career.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And in short, the happiest,
most successful people

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:90%
have abundant energy for life.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody knows that
we get energy from food.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But really, when
you think about it

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
from a fundamental
point of view,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
food is just electrons
and movement of electrons.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's electrons flowing
through a chain that

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
cause the release of
energy in the body.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think about how
food gives you energy,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:90%
it gives you electrical energy.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people say, what?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Electricity?

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a battery?

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, parts of you
kind of are like that.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is, you eat food,

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and glucose or fat or protein,
these things eventually,

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
we hope-- unless they're
stored as fat or excreted--

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
turn into ATP, which
is the primary thing

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that the mitochondria
in our cells use.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:90%
So they generate ATP.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They use ATP to
get any electron.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:90%
That would be electrical.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And once they
generate that electron

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that fuels the cell,
then they recycle ATP

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.703 align:middle line:84%
through a process
in humans that's

00:14:56.703 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of like what
most people know

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.173 align:middle line:84%
happens in plants
with photosynthesis.

00:15:00.173 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been steeped in exercise
science and nutrition science

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And what everybody preaches
is, the way that you

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:90%
get that ATP is with calories.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You eat the right protein
and carb and fat ratios.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And you get your pre and
your post-workout nutrition.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And you make sure that
you have your breakfast

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and that you eat frequently.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And you keep your
metabolism elevated.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But what people
don't realize is,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that only accounts for
a fraction of the energy

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that your body's
actually able to produce.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The body is neither
chemical nor electrical.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, then walk into a taser

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We know if you put a
strong shock on someone,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:90%
something happens.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.597 align:middle line:84%
We measure the flow of
electrons across nerves.

00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
It's called a nerve
conductance study.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:90%
So we know we're electrical.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
We just like to think
that we're chemical.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.633 align:middle line:90%
And that's a broken model.

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
affect electricity

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.883 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals, and you
can affect chemicals

00:16:12.883 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:90%
with electricity.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so if we start to think
about energy more in terms

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of electron transfer, then we
begin to see that there are

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
other ways that we can
get energy into our body.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:32.148 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.148 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There are all these other
ways that you can increase

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:90%
the electron flow in your body.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, just like
a plant has photosynthesis,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
you can use light to create
electrons in your body

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:90%
through structured water.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There is one source of
energy that come from light.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
We have direct evidence that
the light produces energy.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're not taking
into consideration

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
your body's charge based on the
amount of light that you are

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.262 align:middle line:84%
getting, the amount of light
that you aren't getting,

00:17:01.262 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
or even the type of light
that you're getting--

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
blue light versus red
light versus sunlight--

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
then what that means is
that all of your efforts

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:84%
to eat a healthy diet, they're
for naught unless your body is

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:90%
actually charged properly.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You can also do
things like grounding,

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
where electrons are coming up
through the Earth and through

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:90%
your feet.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But also, of course,
how your biochemistry is

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is really, really important
for the flow of electrons.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a healthy
internal mineralized sea,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
then you'll get a very
healthy flow of electrons

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:90%
through your body.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The most crucial thing for
our health and for getting

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining energy in the
body is being in the correct

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.606 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:17:55.606 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When you change the
environment around you

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
or the environment inside
you, your biology responds.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't will your
biology to do something.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:90%
You give your biology a signal.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And the signal your biology
listens to isn't what you want.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It listens to what the
environment tells it.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So I consciously manipulate
the inputs to my body

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.218 align:middle line:90%
so that it will behave itself.

00:18:19.218 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And when it does that, it
unleashes a huge amount

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:90%
of willpower and energy.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And from my perspective,
the environment is at least

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:84%
as important, or
perhaps more important,

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
than the food that
you actually ingest.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I know, in my own case, when
I was trying to get better

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
from chronic fatigue, I'd
followed a really, really

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
strict, super healthy
diet for years and years,

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:90%
yet I was still ill.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But the moment, I
actually changed

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.620 align:middle line:84%
my environment, started
changing my relationships,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
started changing where I
lived, some of the activities

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing, making
sure that I was getting out

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
in the sun and doing
activities where

00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I was connected to electrons, my
energy levels started to soar.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And my diet was consistently the
same both in the early stages

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.813 align:middle line:84%
of my illness and also when
I changed my environment.

00:19:08.813 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I changed my diet.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.833 align:middle line:84%
And I changed the
way I exercise.

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I changed the temperature
of things around me.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I changed the type of
light that I'm exposed to,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
the time I sleep, the time
I eat, the time I exercise.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Those matter greatly.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the bottom
line is, my body

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.263 align:middle line:84%
is an amazing piece
of equipment that

00:19:31.263 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is designed to survive in
the environment around it.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So its senses and responds
to that environment.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't sense and respond
to what I want very well.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stop
using my willpower,

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
wasting it on trying
to make my body

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
do things, and instead
say, this is the lever.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.255 align:middle line:90%
This is the trigger.

00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the switch I
can throw that will make

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
my body listen and respond.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Mae-Wan Ho, a hero of
mine, and someone who wrote

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:84%
extensively on water, she
said that water is the medium

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:90%
and the message of life.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And what she really
meant was, we are water,

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and water is the way that
our bodies communicate,

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and water is the way that we
get energy from the environment.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So water is crucial in
the way that our bodies

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
get energy and the way
that we maintain energy.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no
life without water.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And just like all the fish need
the ocean to live in, in a way,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:90%
our bodies are no different.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is 75% water
with all the oceans.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:90%
We're born into water.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
When you look at our bodies,
we're covered in skin.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But inside the skin
is this internal ocean

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
where every single cell
and every single bacteria

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
is living in this matrix
and medium of water.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:90%
There is no life without water.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, really
important to make sure

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that your internal
sea is full of charge,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that it's as clean as it can be,
and that you surround yourself

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:90%
with the right environment.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
it's your environment

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that will affect the quality
of your internal sea.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, that affects
the quality of how healthy

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:90%
your cells are.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Water that's actually
vibrating at a specific

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:84%
frequency-- specifically,
a frequency you would find

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:84%
in nature, like in water
traveling in underground

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
springs and in the type of form
that we might find in water

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
tumbling down a mountainside,
coming out of the hills--

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
vibrates at a frequency
that's far, far different

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
than a water that's just
sitting stagnant, unmoving,

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
the type of water that,
frankly, most of us drink.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And the idea here
is that when water

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is vibrating with
that frequency,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:84%
it's able to carry
a lot more energy.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It's what's called
structured water.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's able to feed into
the cells a lot more easily.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a far, far better way
to hydrate the body when you're

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:90%
drinking that kind of water.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It gets into the
cells a lot better.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:84%
It's able to carry
energy a lot better.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And water is more
complex than just H2O.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The fourth phase of
water is another phase.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're all taught typically
that water has three phases,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:90%
solid, liquid, and vapor.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth phase of water
is somewhere in between a liquid

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and a solid.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
crystalline type of water.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of it.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So your cells and my cells
are filled not with H2O,

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:90%
but with EZ water.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:90%
EZ stands for exclusion zone.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
We call it exclusion zone
because it excludes, well,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:90%
almost everything.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:90%
So exclusion zone, EZ--

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:90%
that's how it got the name.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It's synonymous with the
fourth phase of water.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
People who are healthy,
who are athletes,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
are actually more
negatively charged,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and people who are sick
have less negative charge.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But the more negative we
are, the healthier we are.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's manifested
in EZ water.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.718 align:middle line:90%
Because the EZ is negative.

00:23:36.718 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
We think of the body as
a very complex organism.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And obviously,
there is complexity.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.485 align:middle line:84%
But the body is
basically a battery.

00:23:58.485 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
You need recharging
of this battery.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:90%
We need recharging.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
The kind of recharging that we
get is not only from the food

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that we eat, but also from
the light that's absorbed.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.435 align:middle line:84%
That's the energy that builds
EZ water and separates charge.

00:24:16.435 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the separated
charge that I believe

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
is the essential part
of running our system.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:90%
This is fuel for our body.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of us think of water
as being this carrying medium

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
for all of the nutrients and
oxygen so that our cells can

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:90%
thrive.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually not
it's only use in the body.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:84%
It also has this really
peculiar property

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:84%
when it's inside
cells, as it ends up

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:90%
in this gel-like structure.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in that
form, it's actually

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
able to convert heat and light
into a source of electrons

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
for your mitochondria to
use as a source of energy.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words, your
body acts a little bit

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:84%
like a body battery
that is able to be

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:90%
charged through light and heat.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so pay attention.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to explain
the body battery.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Just like in a
normal battery where

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
we have a positive and
a negative terminal,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
this is the same as
what happens in our body

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
with structured water which
forms the negative terminal

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.130 align:middle line:90%
of the battery.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that you
have to charge a battery,

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
we also have to
charge our bodies.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can do this with energy
sources such as from the sun,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.033 align:middle line:84%
from ambient heat
around the room.

00:25:32.033 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
going to be looking

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
at things like how you
can charge with cold,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.034 align:middle line:84%
with movement, and
with grounding.

00:25:38.034 --> 00:25:38.834 align:middle line:90%
Ta-da.

00:25:38.834 --> 00:25:41.345 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the easiest ways to get
structured water into your body

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is to drink pure spring
water, or glacial meltwater,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
or water that's come
from a natural well.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Another way to do it is to drink
bottled spring water in a glass

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:84%
bottle, or to juice
organic vegetables,

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:84%
or to expose your
water to sunlight.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Another way is to drink
concentrated structured water.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can also do
loads of activities.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you can just
go swimming in the sea,

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
or go and sit in a
nice, cold river,

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.930 align:middle line:84%
or you can go kite
surfing or surfing.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But all of these
are ways of getting

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:90%
in touch with structured water.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is actually a
scientific benefit to this.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you're exposed to water,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.570 align:middle line:84%
it makes your skin
more conductive,

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
so you're able to get Earth's
electrons into your body

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:90%
more easily.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And by definition, you're
already out in nature

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and being exposed to the sun.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So to get the maximum benefit
of structured water, drink it.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:90%
But also be out in it.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Play in it.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Live in it.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:27:13.998 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.998 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that I
tried to get myself better

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and give myself more
energy was homeopathy.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, how homeopathy works
is, you take a substance,

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and then you dilute
it millions of times

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:90%
in a solution like water.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
that solution and you

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:84%
drop it onto a sugar pill and
end up eating a sugar pill.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
However, what's curious
about homeopathy is,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
what you're actually
diluting is intrinsically

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:90%
a negative message.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Because for instance, you take
something like Nux vomica.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the idea
is that your body

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:84%
will react to that
particular negative message

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to trigger a healing response
to get yourself better.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, with myself, I ended
up getting this reaction

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:90%
from homeopathy.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, I
didn't get myself cured.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:84%
However, what it
did say to me is

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that there's
something in this idea

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that a substance or a
solution can have a memory.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, well, perhaps

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
if you could use positive
information instead

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:84%
of, in homeopathy,
negative information.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So what I decided to do
was record the information

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of healthy tissue and then
imprint that information

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
into water and just
drink that water.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.171 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, I
got my health back.

00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
What professor Pollack
has been able to show

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
is that water, under
certain conditions,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:84%
i.e., when there's lots
of minerals present,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
or when it's next to
water-loving surfaces,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.850 align:middle line:84%
such as that you get in all
cellular tissue in the body,

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:84%
has a structure or, if you
like, crystalline properties.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, why that matters
is that, as soon

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:84%
as you have a structure,
you're basically

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
able to record and
imprint information

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
into that structure, which
is extremely useful when

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to transmit
information into the body.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.655 align:middle line:84%
>> People have questioned the
idea of water memory for good

00:29:18.655 --> 00:29:19.455 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:29:19.455 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And the good reason is that
the studies have shown that,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
in H2O, the stuff that's here,
that the molecules are moving

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
around at a very high
rate, a femtosecond rate.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And so any molecules that
are randomly organized

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and moving around
so quickly, it's

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
hard to imagine that it
could store any information

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Whatsoever

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But now, we've
discovered the EZ water.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And this EZ water has a
crystal-like structure.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
computer memory.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.870 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
computer memory,

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.390 align:middle line:84%
your computer
memory is basically

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:84%
silicon, silicon
dioxide atoms arranged

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in a regular,
three-dimensional array.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:90%
This is similar to that.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a possibility
that the same principle that's

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
used in computer arrays
could be used here.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So the possibility exists that
this could store information.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
When we first started
working with water

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and discovering this phase of
water, we didn't, of course,

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:90%
at first know the structure.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
information in water

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
was something that seemed weird
and strange and maybe possible.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But now, with each
passing year, and seeing

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:84%
information and
experimental evidence--

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:84%
clear experimental evidence
that it can exist--

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:90%
it has changed my view a lot.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I decided to do
was record the information

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
of healthy tissue, and then
imprint that information

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:84%
into water, and just
drink that water.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, I
got my health back.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> There is so much evidence
that water is so central

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.810 align:middle line:84%
to everything that
the body does.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There is compelling research
that says there's something

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:84%
going on with water and that
the water carries information

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So Harry, maybe you can
summarize what we've just

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:90%
learned about memory of water.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Because really, it's what helped
you in your healing journey.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:27.083 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the great things
about structured water

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it's much more easily
able to contain a memory.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.133 align:middle line:84%
And that memory can even be
positive or it can be negative.

00:31:36.133 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
you're living in a city

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and drinking a lot of tap
water, that water continuously

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:84%
picks up all of the bad
memories of all the chemicals

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and drugs and pharmaceuticals
that are in the water system.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Or equally, you could take
really clean, fresh spring

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:84%
water that is highly
mineralized and you

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.805 align:middle line:84%
could add your own
positive information to it,

00:31:55.805 --> 00:31:57.180 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
effect you want,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly
what I did at home.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We are able to
go into some level.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And it showed.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I instructed
people in just four days

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:90%
to be able to go in shorts--

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:84%
minus 10, beginning in
shorts after four days--

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and then climbing up a mountain
at minus 27 Celsius, which

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:90%
is really cold.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors were
with us, completely

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
dressed with shawls, gloves,
hats, coats and all that.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were
suffering from cold.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And these guys, 12 of them, they
were not suffering from cold.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.450 align:middle line:90%
They were dancing.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
We did the Harlem Shake
on top of the mountain

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
After hours going from
minus 10 to minus 27.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.324 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, go!

00:33:34.324 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Go!

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In sports medicine,
people have been doing cold

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
thermogenesis for years to
treat injuries, to lose weight,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.630 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think where Wim Hof has
taken this to another level

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is, he's been able
to prove and show

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can take
completely ordinary people

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:84%
from any type of state,
however much energy or however

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.460 align:middle line:84%
little energy that
they may have, and be

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:84%
able to do cold thermogenesis,
and then be able to do things

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
like walk up mountains with
very, very little training,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:90%
just in their underwear.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.449 align:middle line:84%
Now that's completely
incredible.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.329 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Ugh.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.797 align:middle line:90%
I hate the cold.

00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Who looks forward to that?

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.585 align:middle line:84%
My breathing
treatments are enough.

00:34:23.585 --> 00:34:25.725 align:middle line:90%
I just want to play.

00:34:25.725 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHS]

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, I can
play better if I breathe better

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:90%
and if I get used to the cold.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And every time the
weather changes

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
30 degrees in one day in

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We go from heated homes into our
cars into heated, artificially

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:90%
lit offices and back again.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different lifestyle

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:84%
to the one that our
ancestors would have led,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.210 align:middle line:84%
being more connected to the
ground, sleeping on the ground,

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.428 align:middle line:84%
being in tune with natural
day and night cycles.

00:43:47.428 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So from the point of view of
the life that we live now,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
it is a completely
different life.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We are much more
connected to technology,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to our phones, which
are emitting blue light.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
In effect, it's
an artificial sun

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at, sometimes
from early in the morning

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:90%
until late at night.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So really, what we
need to do is get back

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.930 align:middle line:84%
to a more connected
way of life, back

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:84%
to a more natural way of
living, where we're more in tune

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.535 align:middle line:90%
with our natural cycles.

00:44:13.535 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We're the most
addicted culture.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are more
connected electronically

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:90%
than ever before in history.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.515 align:middle line:90%
And that's not going to let up.

00:44:33.515 --> 00:44:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
going to get worse.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're the most
disconnected from other people,

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
from ourselves, than we
ever have been as a culture.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you don't
manage modern life,

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:90%
it will manage you.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, with the
computer generation,

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.310 align:middle line:90%
we're increasing our technology.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.680 align:middle line:84%
We're doubling every
two to three years.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.690 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of scary.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And we think we can control.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:90%
We are technology.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We are, wow, so
much above animals.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot control
our happiness.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I do realize
that when I was obese,

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I would sit in a room with 1,000
watts of bright house and light

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:84%
late at night, studying
and reading and doing work

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, which
is something that contributes

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to obesity that no
one talks about.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest nuclear
plant is the sun itself.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But it is the right resonance
and the right energy.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And we copied it.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.290 align:middle line:90%
And we copied it artificially.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And we are using it in a
way that our physiology,

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:46.260 align:middle line:84%
the melatonin-serotonin
balance, is disbalanced.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And we just need to
learn to balance again.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What people don't realize
is that these vibrations are

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:90%
unseen forces.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We can't see them, taste
them, smell them, hear them.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But they're insidiously breaking
down ourselves and our body.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's relentless.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And in utero is the worst.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:90%
An infant is bad.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But the younger the child,
the worse the effect.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:22.519 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.519 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What Kate's managed to be
able to do with her family is

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.430 align:middle line:84%
really help her kids to become
in tune with the circadian

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.230 align:middle line:90%
rhythms.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And she's really done
this through changing

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.730 align:middle line:84%
their environment and their
relationship to technology.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
incredible about this is,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:84%
we're all used to thinking
of autism as either something

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:44.390 align:middle line:84%
incurable, possibly
caused by vaccines,

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps having a
genetic disposition.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But what Kate's family's
story has been able to show

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.260 align:middle line:84%
is that just through simply
changing your environment,

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.390 align:middle line:84%
getting more in tune
with circadian rhythms,

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and having a balance
with technology,

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.110 align:middle line:84%
she's been able to help her
children to overcome symptoms

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:90%
of autism.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
quite incredible.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> You think what?

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Something was missing.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Something's missing?

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:84%
He had a ton of
repetitive behaviors.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
He just was not able
to focus or stay

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.190 align:middle line:84%
put for more than three
seconds at a time.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, socially, he
was in his own little world.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:33.930 align:middle line:84%
We went to the schools,
and they said, well,

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:84%
we have a preschool
program that has

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:44.240 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of kids in
there, between autism and Down

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.040 align:middle line:90%
syndrome.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.860 align:middle line:84%
What autism is an
energy shortage.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.760 align:middle line:84%
The brain is trying to process
all of these sensory things,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and it just says, sorry,
I don't have enough energy

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.200 align:middle line:90%
to process all these things.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So when we started to
manipulate his environment

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.960 align:middle line:84%
with the lights,
and the grounding,

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and turning off the Wi-Fi,
and all these things,

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.400 align:middle line:84%
he was able to create
more energy pathways

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and reconnect them or connect
them for the first time.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we really started

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
to see the growth in Ryan.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you like school?

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.460 align:middle line:90%
What do you like about school?

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I like recess.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, recess.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.530 align:middle line:84%
We hardwired all
of our computers.

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
We got rid of that iPad
that had the Wi-Fi.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:84%
We actually, for awhile,
got rid of our TV.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we ended
up re-buying a TV.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a smart TV.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It does not have Wi-Fi.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.720 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
special about it.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then yeah, we changed
all of the light bulbs.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had red for
the night lights.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the
majority of our house

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.790 align:middle line:90%
is either amber or orange.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:09.780 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a huge thing,
especially in the realm

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.050 align:middle line:90%
of the autism stuff.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they started
sleeping through the night,

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and they started
to calm way down.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:25.680 align:middle line:84%
8:00 o'clock rolls around, and
my kids are like, it's bedtime.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And they put themselves to bed.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:36.100 align:middle line:84%
The changes that we made,
by fall, when he went back,

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:90%
the school was floored.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.706 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no!

00:49:40.706 --> 00:49:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The school called
us and they said,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.830 align:middle line:90%
so how's Ryan doing at home?

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, he
comes home and he's

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.340 align:middle line:90%
got this big grin on his face.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.440 align:middle line:90%
There's something different.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.710 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:00.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
you're doing differently.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But we need to know
what you're doing.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, I don't know.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Is this a good phone call?

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Is he disruptive?

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.562 align:middle line:84%
Is this a good or bad
kind of phone call?

00:50:13.562 --> 00:50:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
no, no, no, no.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.060 align:middle line:90%
We mainstreamed him.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I took three seconds to
myself, thinking, you did what?

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.940 align:middle line:90%
You mainstreamed my kid?

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And not too long after that,
they called back and said,

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:84%
oh, we've got to
change his goals again.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.500 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> But I fight the damage.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I try and marry a modern
life to an ancestral life.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.660 align:middle line:90%
How do I do that?

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I have things like dirty
electricity filters installed

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:90%
in each room in my home.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm limiting the amount
of electrical surges

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.790 align:middle line:90%
that are occurring in my home.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I use the internet, but I use
metal shielded ethernet cable

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.420 align:middle line:90%
in each room in the house.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And rather than having
a Wi-Fi router on,

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I plug into the wall outlets.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Just about everything in
my home runs on electricity

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:17.170 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of an EMF
blocker attached to it.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The ways that I like to
reduce exposure to blue light

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.420 align:middle line:84%
are by, number one, to
the extent that I can,

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.360 align:middle line:84%
being away from technology
after the sun goes down.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.820 align:middle line:84%
If I can't do that, I'll
wear blue-blocking glasses,

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.620 align:middle line:90%
which can be really helpful.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, there are so many
cool apps and pieces of software

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:35.950 align:middle line:84%
coming out today that allow
you to pull the blue light out

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:middle line:84%
automatically of
your electronics

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.910 align:middle line:90%
after the sun goes down.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, bye.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.040 align:middle line:84%

Oh, Nan, I've got to go.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.080 align:middle line:90%
We're filming.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to
summarize, technology

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.640 align:middle line:84%
is rising at such
an exponential rate.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But along with the rise in
technology, unfortunately,

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have the greatest
effect on our own biology.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways
to minimize it.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And how do you do that, Sarah?

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we can
do simple things.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.310 align:middle line:84%
On our laptops, we can hardwire
them in using an ethernet.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:12.040 align:middle line:84%
We can turn off the Wi-Fi
when we're not using it.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.200 align:middle line:90%
We can not have it on our laps.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.480 align:middle line:84%
We can use grounding mats
when we're on technology.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and also, after dark,
we can limit our exposure

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:21.190 align:middle line:90%
to blue light.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So ways of doing that are
to use orange glasses,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.710 align:middle line:84%
or you can also use these
filters on your computer

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.660 align:middle line:90%
screens and on your phones.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, it's just about
striking a balance between

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the world we live in, which
is a technology world,

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.660 align:middle line:90%
and getting out in nature.

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:53:14.246 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.246 --> 00:53:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What a good idea to
come for a walk, Harry.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to feel
a bit more charged up.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Aw, I just love
being out in nature.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You can just feel the sun
on the back of your head

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and all the electrons
coming up through your feet.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a reason that you
feel good when you go out

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.620 align:middle line:90%
in the sun.

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Your body's actually using
that sun to create nutrients

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.990 align:middle line:90%
for your body to thrive on.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us today are
just kind of stuck in cubicles

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.588 align:middle line:84%
or stuck in cars and
dodging the sunlight

00:53:39.588 --> 00:53:41.880 align:middle line:84%
because we've been brainwashed
to think that it's going

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.650 align:middle line:90%
to give us cancer immediately.

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if we do go out
in the sun, we're

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.420 align:middle line:84%
slathering all these other
toxic chemicals onto our body

00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we don't
get even a little bit of sun.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
optimize your health,

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.610 align:middle line:84%
sun is an essential
nutrient for your body,

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and a source of energy.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:13.680 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Our bodies are naturally
adapted to living within

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.830 align:middle line:90%
circadian rhythms.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we mean by
that is, if you took

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:25.320 align:middle line:84%
all of our technology and
modern lifestyle away,

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.070 align:middle line:84%
we would wake up from the
sun, the sky would go blue,

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and that strong blue light
would stimulate cortisol.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So we would get this
nice rise in energy.

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.500 align:middle line:84%
We would go out and
hunt for our food

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and do quite active
things during the day.

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And then as we get towards
the end of the day,

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.545 align:middle line:90%
the sun begins to set.

00:54:43.545 --> 00:54:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It starts to go orange.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
produce melatonin.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Our cortisol level goes down.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Our melatonin goes up.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And we end up in this
nice, natural state,

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:84%
so we get a really,
really good night's sleep.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:01.585 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.585 --> 00:55:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And then towards
the end of the day,

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:06.660 align:middle line:84%
when things start winding down
and the sun starts going down,

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.930 align:middle line:84%
this is a time when we want
to do things like not looking

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.460 align:middle line:84%
at technology, trying to have
more peaceful orange light

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.230 align:middle line:90%
in our houses.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're mimicking
what's going on outside.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.420 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
help our bodies

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to stay in tune with
that natural cycle.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to have huge
benefits for our physiology.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Your body really needs to get
those visual cues to know when

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:84%
it's dark, when it's light, so
that it can release the natural

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.630 align:middle line:84%
hormones it needs to help you
sleep and stay asleep all night

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:38.430 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.930 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons that we're

sleep-deprived now,

00:55:42.262 --> 00:55:44.470 align:middle line:84%

it something that's

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.100 align:middle line:90%
holding me back from optimal.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.950 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I was born into.

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to fight it.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.670 align:middle line:84%
For once, I can just
fall right into it

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%
and let my body be at home.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I can tell you
that my heart is a cathode,

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
or that it's a super magnet,
and that, when I do CT,

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like
I'm strengthening

things in this planet to me.

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And that is what I tell myself.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
When I feel like I'm doing
everything that I can do,

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
I feel empowered.

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And often, when I'm grounding,
for example, or climbing,

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.650 align:middle line:90%
I literally feel charged.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.524 align:middle line:90%

to increase my energy from

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
my healing journey is my
relationship to my outdoor

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.160 align:middle line:90%
activities.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But two of my favorite
things are, one,

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
kiteboarding, which
I do on the ocean.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly in
touch with the electrons

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.580 align:middle line:90%
straight from the ocean.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing is rock climbing,

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
where I'm able to put
my hands on the rock

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and spend all day
outside and totally

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
be in tune with Earth's
magnetism and grounding

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:24.620 align:middle line:90%
electrons.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.380 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a kid growing
up in New York City,

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
we had the ocean right
near us and the beach.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go every
weekend in the summer.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I remember an experience
of getting buried in the sand.

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Most of us know about walking
barefoot on the beach.

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
We feel good.

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
understand why we feel good.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.388 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
reason we feel good

01:01:46.388 --> 01:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is, we're touching the earth
and gaining negativity.

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
But I was buried up to here.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
My friends buried me,
and we buried them.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And it was fun.

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember so
distinctly feeling so good

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:01.742 align:middle line:84%
that I just didn't
want to get unburied.

01:02:01.742 --> 01:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue at the time
what that might have meant.

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
But I remembered it, because it
was such a significant feeling.

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And now I understand,
I'm connecting myself--

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
my whole body, not just
my feet-- to the Earth

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and receiving that negativity.

How does that happen?

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is,
you're absorbing electrons

from the Earth's surface.

01:02:58.938 --> 01:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%

it, but the Earth

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is struck by lightning
thousands of times a minute,

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.190 align:middle line:90%
especially around the equator.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And the earth is charged
with all these electrons.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And the beauty is, they're free.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
When we put our bare
feet on the ground

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and we take in that
Schumann energy,

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
the 7.83 Hertz, the experimental
work that I've done on it

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
shows that we improve
the blood viscosity.

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:35.013 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
make the blood thinner.

01:03:35.013 --> 01:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you make
the blood thinner,

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
make it more like
red wine, you're

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
enhancing the health
of the organism.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:43.485 align:middle line:84%
So when people go
on vacations, when

01:03:43.485 --> 01:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
they're walking on
the beach, the water

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:46.663 align:middle line:90%
is going over their feet.

01:03:46.663 --> 01:03:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Then they're
touching the minerals

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.205 align:middle line:90%

01:03:49.205 --> 01:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
All those seashells
have minerals in them.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And that K1 point, the sole of
our foot, is a crucial point.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it's actually the
master point for the meridians,

the energy processes
of the body.

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk
barefoot on the ocean,

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
or on grass, or on
concrete, you're

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.602 align:middle line:84%
absorbing the
energy of the Earth.

01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And the energy of the Earth--

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
you can achieve that
increase of negative charge.

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%

all about negative charge

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and the need to
ground ourselves.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm always
trying to tell Sarah

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.592 align:middle line:90%
to be a bit more positive.

01:04:35.592 --> 01:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But when we're talking
about going barefoot,

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
we're actually talking
about being more negative.

01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when we put our
bare feet on the ground,

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
drawing up negatively

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:46.940 align:middle line:90%
charged electrons into our body.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And as strange as
it may sound, that's

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
what we need to power our body's
battery, that negative charge.

of his patients,

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
he measured that blood, looking
at their inflammation markers,

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
but also the clumping of
their red blood cells.

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And what he found is, when
those patients were grounded,

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
inflammation went down, and the
energy of the red blood cells

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:13.107 align:middle line:90%
went up.

And I started exercising.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was painful,
and I was sore.

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And it took a while to learn
what to do and how to do it.

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:36.227 align:middle line:90%
But I was there.

01:07:36.227 --> 01:07:37.060 align:middle line:90%
And I kept doing it.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.977 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
started feeling better.

01:07:38.977 --> 01:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I started feeling
more energetic.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow, I
like the way that I feel.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:44.250 align:middle line:90%
And I loved that.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I totally
got into exercising,

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and I transformed
myself physically.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I was never this big guy,
but I became very muscular

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and I became very strong.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.365 align:middle line:84%
And what it did for my
mind and how I felt,

01:07:56.365 --> 01:07:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow,
through exercise

01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
you could actually reproduce
chemistry in your brain.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, a gym
membership will do

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
more for someone's mental state
than going to a therapist.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.930 align:middle line:90%


01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
There's an Indian proverb which
is, he who has their health

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.820 align:middle line:90%
has a thousand dreams.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
He who does not have
their health has only one.

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And having them
so close to death

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
by my own behavior
of doing drugs,

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I think I had a
great contrast of,

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
man, here's what it
looks like and feels

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.029 align:middle line:84%
like to be incredibly ill,
to be incredibly out of it.

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And here I am feeling strong.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:36.894 align:middle line:90%
I want more of that.

01:08:36.894 --> 01:08:44.779 align:middle line:90%


01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:45.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm an entrepreneur.

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:48.593 align:middle line:84%
I'm the founder of
the Genius Network.

01:08:48.593 --> 01:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
What I realized, though, is that
even if you truly are a victim,

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.135 align:middle line:84%
even if you've had bad
things happen to you--

01:08:53.135 --> 01:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and who hasn't, at different
levels for different people--

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.729 align:middle line:84%
you just don't get
any power out of it.

01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And so somehow, I
learned that I can

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.620 align:middle line:90%
create my own internal power.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.590 align:middle line:90%


01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons movement
is so critical to increasing

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.729 align:middle line:84%
your overall energy in the
body is, without movement,

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:15.560 align:middle line:84%
you don't get
proper energy flow.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
that energy flow

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that makes you feel like
you've got a lot of energy

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and that you can think
quickly and coherently.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Movement is really
important for us as humans,

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
because, really,
we've evolved moving.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
We are adapted to do
functional movement.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.609 align:middle line:84%
And by functional
movement, I mean movement

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
would have done,

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
like running to catch prey
or long walks over plains.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So any of that kind
of movement that

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
mimics the movement
we've evolved to

01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
hugely beneficial.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.270 align:middle line:90%


01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people think of
exercise as this pill that they

01:09:56.590 --> 01:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
take at the beginning of the
day or at the end of the day.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way
that I live my life.

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I hack my environment so that
I can engage in low level

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
physical activity all day long.

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I use a standing workstation
that will go up and down.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So I can stand, I can
kneel, I can lunge.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.400 align:middle line:90%
I can lie on my stomach.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I can get up on my knees.

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I use a treadmill
workstation so that when

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing phone consults,
and when I'm on phone calls,

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
or when I'm typing, I can
walk three to five miles

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.680 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.420 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get
to the end of the,

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.170 align:middle line:90%
day exercise is not a necessity.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It's an option.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:44.180 align:middle line:90%


01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people think that
to get fit you have to exercise

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
for a really long time,
especially if you want to do

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
things like build stamina
and build endurance.

01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But what research has shown
is that you can simply

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
expose the body to really
brief bouts of high intensity

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
interval training to build
fitness just as fast.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.142 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot better than a
two-hour run, isn't it?

01:11:16.142 --> 01:11:16.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:16.942 --> 01:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%


01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I'll
do on a bicycle, or swimming,

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.786 align:middle line:84%
or lifting, or running
is simply brief bursts.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:35.622 align:middle line:90%


01:11:35.622 --> 01:11:38.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, really, one of the most
important things to do is just

01:11:38.205 --> 01:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
to keep moving around all day.

01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And that includes lifting
people like Sarah.

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:45.300 align:middle line:90%
What else should you do?

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, anything that's
natural to the body--

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.570 align:middle line:84%
so natural functional movement,
standing more, climbing,

01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:54.300 align:middle line:90%
lifting heavy things, walking.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And really, this is all
about just doing quite gentle

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.680 align:middle line:90%
functional movement.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not overly
stressing the body,

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
like pounding
yourself in the gym

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
or running for an
hour on concrete.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you really want
to enhance performance,

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
you should mix this
functional movement

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:11.763 align:middle line:84%
in with really intense
bursts of exercise.

01:12:11.763 --> 01:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So really, what we're
saying is, move more.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.640 align:middle line:90%


01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.503 align:middle line:84%
>> It's always been
about staying ahead.

01:12:22.503 --> 01:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to
outsmart my doctors

01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
or trying to make
them feel dumb.

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I wish we'd stop
trying to chase down a cure

01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and just try to be the cure.

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I was born supercharged,
and I want to stay that way.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
If something beats me down to
a punch bug, then I'll take it.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.300 align:middle line:90%
But I won't go easy.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
My doctors and I don't
always get along,

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
because I think I can do it,
and they think I've done enough.

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I want clarity from a trial.

01:12:56.650 --> 01:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to just be
submissive and die quietly.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.775 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a fight.

01:13:04.775 --> 01:13:05.665 align:middle line:90%
[GIGGLING]

01:13:05.665 --> 01:13:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Get her, Ry!

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel fantastic.

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And really, when
you think about it,

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:12.880 align:middle line:90%
it's a never-ending journey.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.213 align:middle line:84%
You don't just lose all the
weight and you're like, woo,

01:13:15.213 --> 01:13:16.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm done!

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.060 align:middle line:84%
There are always things
that can be improved.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think of yourself as
a battery, and you're drained,

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
or you have no charge, then you
want to charge your batteries.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And so charging your batteries
is sleep, exercise, nutrition,

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:29.750 align:middle line:90%
those sorts of things.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.422 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
be supercharged,

01:13:31.422 --> 01:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go to
a whole other level,

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:34.600 align:middle line:90%
you look at things.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
What I look at is meditation,
floating, exercise,

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
flexibility, and a
great environment.

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.170 align:middle line:90%
That keeps me supercharged.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel like a champion.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I just want to keep going.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.085 align:middle line:84%
I want to see how far you
can take this biohacking

01:13:49.085 --> 01:13:50.440 align:middle line:90%
and supercharged.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.880 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
For me, my life has
always been about learning

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:55.690 align:middle line:90%
about healing and health.

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to continue that,

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.081 align:middle line:84%
to see really, really what is
possible in the human body.

01:14:01.081 --> 01:14:16.457 align:middle line:90%


01:14:16.457 --> 01:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the most
fascinating things to me is,

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.873 align:middle line:84%
despite learning all the
science behind what it is to be

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
supercharged, ultimately, what
it's all about is getting back

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to nature and charging the
water in our body batteries.

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So I love to see people go
from being kind of fat, sick,

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and sluggish to all of a sudden
being beasts in their day

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.640 align:middle line:90%
to day lives.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.557 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, they're
making tons of money.

01:14:39.557 --> 01:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
They're finally taking that
vacation with their family.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.607 align:middle line:84%
They're doing things
that they've always

01:14:43.607 --> 01:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do because they
experience being supercharged.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And once you do,
there's no turning back.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're living in this
charged, connected environment.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you get
supercharged by optimizing

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:02.340 align:middle line:84%
your air, your light, your
water, your electricity,

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
your emotions,
and all the people

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
around you start to get
supercharged too, then,

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, we bring up
and we optimize the physical,

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
the mental, and even the
spiritual performance

01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:18.990 align:middle line:90%
of the entire planet.

>> As you start to get
supercharged and use all

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:30.210 align:middle line:84%
of these alternative sources
of energy outside of food,

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
your body ends up like this
living matrix of energy where

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:37.180 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you have
abundant energy for life.

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.550 align:middle line:90%

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:40.670 align:middle line:90%
