00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:05.375
(gentle operatic music)

2
00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:17.827
<v Voiceover>She actually saw a light,</v>

3
00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:19.624
a white light enter her body.

4
00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:22.146
<v Voiceover>And from the middle of the light</v>

5
00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:24.450
came the words, "You are healed."

6
00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:29.738 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>A force just took a hold of me.</v>

7
00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.861
It lifted me up off my feet.

8
00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:36.499 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And as I was looking at her I mean</v>

9
00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:38.255
she just radiated light.

10
00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:41.172
(sparkling)

11
00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:42.784
<v Voiceover>And there seemed to be a person</v>

12
00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:44.848
or force standing in the doorway.

13
00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:47.488
To prevent me from entering.

14
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Voiceover>It was just a wonderful miracle.</v>

15
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Voiceover>What comes to mind</v>

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.990
when you hear the word miracle?

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.970
Incredible coincidence?

18
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.400
The power of mind over matter?

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.830
Biblical stories like those of the burning bush,

20
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.000
or the parting of the Red Sea?

21
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.090
What do we mean by a miracle anyway?

22
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.082
A miracle is something that appears to be

23
00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:14.600
unexplainable by the laws of nature,

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.300
and so is thought to be supernatural in origin,

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.020
or an act of God.

26
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.670
Webster said that.

27
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.420
Unexplainable by the laws of nature.

28
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.920
<v ->Just like hundreds of years ago,</v>

29
00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:28.556
no one would imagine a man walking on the moon,

30
00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:30.986
if they saw it they would call it a miracle.

31
00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.476
Maybe in 500 years the miracles that we see

32
00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.338
every single day that we can't explain

33
00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:37.046
will be explainable.

34
00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:39.236
<v ->I don't like to use words like miracle,</v>

35
00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:40.826
or spontaneous remission,

36
00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:44.426
because they lead you away from research.

37
00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.826
You don't do research on miracles.

38
00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.596
I mean if somebody goes to Lourde's

39
00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.248
and their cancer disappears,

40
00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:52.946
and we have evidence of certain cases,

41
00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.676
you'd say, "Well he went to Lourde's that's a miracle."

42
00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:58.526
But I'd rather take all the people who went to Lourde's,

43
00:01:58.526 --> 00:01:59.460
sit 'em down and say,

44
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.550
"Fill out this form, and tell me

45
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.490
"what you did, why you think it happened,

46
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.502
"how did you get to Lourde's?

47
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:08.760
"You take a train or an airplane?"

48
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.470
You know, let's look at all these facts,

49
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.060
so that when the next person says,

50
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.470
"I have an incurable disease."

51
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.670
You say, "Look, here's the list,

52
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.530
"maybe you wanna go to Lourde's."

53
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Voiceover>So when we hear contemporary stories</v>

54
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.262
that seem to be unexplainable by the laws of nature,

55
00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:25.382
we have to ask, "Are these miracles?"

56
00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:27.720
To shed some light on these mysterious happenings,

57
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.640
and how they affect lives,

58
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.770
we'll look into some contemporary accounts

59
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.440
from people who believe that miracles do happen.

60
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.416
We'll hear in their own words,

61
00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:40.274
their personal stories of miracles.

62
00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:45.844
(gentle music)

63
00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:48.244
Joan Wester Anderson, a magazine journalist,

64
00:02:48.244 --> 00:02:52.024
and author, says she experienced a miracle firsthand,

65
00:02:52.024 --> 00:02:53.946
and went on to investigate other stories

66
00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.774
that were then published in her book,

67
00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.496
Where Miracles Happen.

68
00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:00.036
<v ->I had this image of miracles as happening</v>

69
00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:02.644
in huge shrines, or to very special people,

70
00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:04.624 line:15% 
or perhaps things that happened

71
00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:06.784 line:15% 
years and years and years ago.

72
00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:10.026
But certainly not today, to ordinary people.

73
00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:15.349
But one day I was out raking our leaves

74
00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.529
in the back yard, stuffing bags full of them,

75
00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.059
when all of a sudden I look down

76
00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.309
and realized, in horror, that my wedding

77
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.633
and engagement rings were not on my finger.

78
00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:30.591
When I looked at the back yard I realized

79
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:32.831
they had to be out here somewhere,

80
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:35.211
but there was absolutely no way that I was

81
00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:37.085
ever going to find them.

82
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.887
And just then a friend of mine stepped

83
00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:42.519
through the hedge which divided our two properties,

84
00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.899
and I didn't know her real well

85
00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:48.541
at that time, and she trudged across the leaves and said,

86
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:50.023
"What's wrong?"

87
00:03:50.023 --> 00:03:52.067
She could tell and I held up my hand and said,

88
00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:54.251
"I've lost my rings out here."

89
00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:56.323
And she said, "Well let's pray about it."

90
00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:58.787
She grabbed my hand, and pushed me down

91
00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.747
in the leaves to a kneeling position, I'm thinking,

92
00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:03.883
"What if someone's looking out the window

93
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:05.199
"and sees us doing this?"

94
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.803
But at the same time it seemed so nice.

95
00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:11.513
And she began to talk to God about it,

96
00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:13.781
she just said, "God we need a miracle,

97
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.517
"we have to find the rings, they're out here

98
00:04:15.517 --> 00:04:17.113
"and you know where they are."

99
00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:20.417
And then she kinda stopped,

100
00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:22.855
and I thought, "Well now that was really nice of her."

101
00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.393
But not for a minute did I think anything

102
00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:26.269
was going to happen.

103
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:29.603
She got up, she started walking across the lawn

104
00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.149
and she went around a huge pile

105
00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:34.949
and then stopped, as if she was listening almost,

106
00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.527
and then she took a couple more steps,

107
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.485
stopped in front of another pile,

108
00:04:39.485 --> 00:04:41.585
reached down and pulled out both my rings,

109
00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.435
now they were not connected.

110
00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:45.113
The very fact that they were both there,

111
00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:47.773
and she pulled them both up and said,

112
00:04:47.773 --> 00:04:49.145
"Here they are."

113
00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:51.497
Just as if she wasn't even surprised.

114
00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:52.701
How did you do that?

115
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:53.681
And she said,

116
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.341
"I didn't do it, God did it.

117
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:58.525
"He told me where to look."

118
00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:01.017
And from that time on, I began to change

119
00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:03.733
my perspective of what a miracle was.

120
00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:06.673
When you put them in a framework that people

121
00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.781
can identify with, then you find that

122
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:11.379
a lot of people say,

123
00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.791
"Oh, well I've had a miracle."

124
00:05:16.277 --> 00:05:21.121
(wind blowing)

125
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.481
<v Voiceover>I was in the shower, kind of listening</v>

126
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:27.729
to the pager and my tones went off.

127
00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.557
It came across as a car fire.

128
00:05:30.557 --> 00:05:33.385
<v Voiceover>Marker 37, car on fire.</v>

129
00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:34.841
<v ->I felt such a urgency,</v>

130
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.895
like I've never experienced before.

131
00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:39.993
I felt like I had hands on my back

132
00:05:39.993 --> 00:05:42.683
just pushing me, and I needed to get out,

133
00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:45.565
I needed to hurry up and get to the scene.

134
00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:47.217
<v Voiceover>Mary Mueller, a firefighter,</v>

135
00:05:47.217 --> 00:05:48.983
was the first emergency worker to arrive

136
00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.921
at the scene of a tragic automobile accident.

137
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:53.741
What happened next is described by

138
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:56.541
Joan Wester Anderson, who included Mary's story

139
00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:58.137
in her book.

140
00:05:58.137 --> 00:05:59.371
<v ->Now the ironic part here was</v>

141
00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:02.169
that there was no fire, ultimately,

142
00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.849
but the first call that came in

143
00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.669
summoned firefighters because it was

144
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.321
an incorrect call.

145
00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:09.729 line:15% 
<v ->I got within couple hundred feet</v>

146
00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.287 line:15% 
of the scene itself, and I just couldn't imagine

147
00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:16.335 line:15% 
what had happened here.

148
00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:19.361
It seemed like a car bomb had gone off,

149
00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:21.125
it was just complete devastation,

150
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.981
there was tires all over from one side of the road

151
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:25.719
to the other, out in the field.

152
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:28.349
There was the top of the vehicle had been

153
00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.841
peeled open like a can opener.

154
00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:34.173
At this point, I looked down into the ditch area,

155
00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:36.609
and I saw a body down there.

156
00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:39.045
<v ->She slid down the snow on her knees</v>

157
00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:40.847
to this woman and discovered that she was

158
00:06:40.847 --> 00:06:43.647
bleeding to death from a massive wound.

159
00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:46.895
Mary had nothing to stem the blood

160
00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:49.863
except her firefighter's gloves.

161
00:06:49.863 --> 00:06:51.879
But they were covered with soot,

162
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.579
and she felt, "I can't put that on this

163
00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:56.819
"young woman's head, because I'll introduce

164
00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.359
"so much infection."

165
00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.621
<v ->And I knew that I needed something really quick.</v>

166
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.861
And there was no medical help around,

167
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.597
and I had nothing.

168
00:07:05.597 --> 00:07:08.369
And in a split second that I looked over to my left

169
00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.311
at the car, and I looked over to the right

170
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:14.221
at the bystanders who were a good distance

171
00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:17.471
away from me, I just reached way down

172
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:19.429
in my heart and I said,

173
00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:21.669
"God, I really need some help here.

174
00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.075
"I'm gonna lose this girl, I can't do this by myself."

175
00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:28.287
And in that split second,

176
00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:31.927
a reddish color medical bag showed up

177
00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:35.371
approximately 12 inches off of my left knee.

178
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.275
<v ->There were no footprints around it</v>

179
00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:39.683
in the snow, there was no way that it could've appeared,

180
00:07:39.683 --> 00:07:41.699
but there it was, and she said,

181
00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.885
"I didn't even have time to wonder at it,

182
00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:46.291
"I clicked it open, it had everything I needed,

183
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.727
"all the white gauze, pads, everything sterile."

184
00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:51.891
And she began to take these out

185
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:54.439
and just use them one after another.

186
00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.539
<v ->But when the EMS personnel did get there</v>

187
00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.227
the ambulance crew, paramedics, they came down

188
00:07:59.227 --> 00:08:03.231
and at this point, I was out of bandages

189
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:06.255
in the bag itself, they were all gone.

190
00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:07.683
And it was perfect timing,

191
00:08:07.683 --> 00:08:09.923
they got there, they did their assessment

192
00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.631
after I told 'em what I had had,

193
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.031
just to verify things,

194
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:16.475
and the paramedic kind of pulled my hand up

195
00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:19.135
just a little bit to take a peek at the injury,

196
00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:21.515
and he put my hand right back down

197
00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:23.391
and he kinda whispered into my ear

198
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:26.723
so not to upset the victim, he says,

199
00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:28.627
"Mary, you're holding this girl's life in your hands,

200
00:08:28.627 --> 00:08:30.447
"don't let go."

201
00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:32.493
And I'm like, "Oh boy, this is a heavy job."

202
00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:33.527
(laughs)

203
00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:35.993
So, I kept the pressure on the best I could,

204
00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:39.043
and because the severity, they taped my hands

205
00:08:39.043 --> 00:08:41.815
to her head to keep the pressure on,

206
00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:45.287
and then they taped both of us to the back board.

207
00:08:46.807 --> 00:08:48.451
<v ->Took them to the hospital</v>

208
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:50.439
and the girl recovered eventually.

209
00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:54.023
About an hour or two later, Mary left the hospital

210
00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:55.843
and went back to the scene,

211
00:08:55.843 --> 00:08:58.839
to recover that mysterious medical bag.

212
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.415
<v Voiceover>Mary found no evidence of the mysterious bag,</v>

213
00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:05.027
no discarded bandages, no sterile wrappers.

214
00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:06.959
The bag had vanished.

215
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.695
<v ->The bag was gone,</v>

216
00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:10.459
and I said, "Well who cleaned this up?"

217
00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:12.055
And they said, "Nobody cleaned it up,

218
00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:14.855
"we thought you took it with you."

219
00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:16.957
I said, "I couldn't have my hands were taped

220
00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.691
"to this girl's head."

221
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.791
And um...

222
00:09:20.651 --> 00:09:22.313
Made many inquiries,

223
00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:25.057
had many questions, and they all

224
00:09:25.057 --> 00:09:27.689
just came back to nobody knows where it came from

225
00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:30.359
and we haven't seen it since

226
00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:32.207
after that scene.

227
00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:34.109
It's gone.

228
00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:40.327
(calm music)

229
00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:41.853
(wind howling)

230
00:09:41.853 --> 00:09:43.895
<v Voiceover>Paul Robert Walker, author of</v>

231
00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:47.031
Every Day's A Miracle, also began his research

232
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:50.282
as a result of a personal story.

233
00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:51.628
<v ->I was eager to do the book,</v>

234
00:09:51.628 --> 00:09:54.232 line:15% 
but I wasn't quite sure how to get into it,

235
00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:56.834 line:15% 
how to approach it, I wanted to tell the stories

236
00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:59.008
with an authenticity and an honesty,

237
00:09:59.008 --> 00:10:00.324
and a humanity.

238
00:10:00.324 --> 00:10:01.752
And I was thinking about it,

239
00:10:01.752 --> 00:10:03.964
I realized, that I have been living with my own

240
00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:06.930
miracle story for as long as I could remember.

241
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.564
And it was really very much a part of my life.

242
00:10:09.564 --> 00:10:12.336
My story, it really began with my mother,

243
00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:14.324
it's my mother's story.

244
00:10:14.324 --> 00:10:16.340
My mother and father had been married for about

245
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.308
10 years in 1952, and in that time,

246
00:10:19.308 --> 00:10:21.744
they had never been able to have children.

247
00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:24.542
And they felt that they better take the steps

248
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:27.047
for adoption, because they really wanted a family.

249
00:10:28.283 --> 00:10:29.513
One of the things that really appealed

250
00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:31.195
to my mother about Catholicism

251
00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:33.827
was the emphasis on Mary.

252
00:10:33.827 --> 00:10:35.367
Because of course she was going through a time

253
00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:37.019
in her life where she was struggling with the issue

254
00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:39.257
of motherhood, she wanted so much to be a mother,

255
00:10:39.257 --> 00:10:41.187
and here was this mother figure.

256
00:10:42.115 --> 00:10:43.709
My mother prayed, asking that she be

257
00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.475
granted a child of her own.

258
00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:46.565
And saying too that

259
00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:48.301
if that was not in God's will,

260
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:50.319
she would gladly adopt a child

261
00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:51.831
and do everything she could to

262
00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:53.985
be a good mother to the adopted child.

263
00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:56.143
Well after she said the prayer,

264
00:10:56.143 --> 00:10:58.271
my mother felt as if a real weight

265
00:10:58.271 --> 00:11:00.036
had been lifted from her that she had placed

266
00:11:00.036 --> 00:11:01.827
her problem in the hands of Mary,

267
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.291
and in turn in the hands of God.

268
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.363
Well, nine months to the date

269
00:11:06.363 --> 00:11:09.345
from that prayer, I was born.

270
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.900
Now, I don't remember exactly when my mother told me

271
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.252
this story, but I was quite young,

272
00:11:15.252 --> 00:11:18.304
and it has imbued my life with

273
00:11:18.304 --> 00:11:20.458
sort of a sweet sense of mysticism.

274
00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:23.148
A sense that there really is power out there,

275
00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:26.256
that there really is a spiritual world.

276
00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:28.104
And that in fact my very life

277
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.611
is a product of that power.

278
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:33.327
(gentle music)

279
00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:34.529
<v Voiceover>There are times when miracle stories</v>

280
00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:37.777
seem to carry their own badge of proof.

281
00:11:37.777 --> 00:11:39.431
When circumstantial evidence

282
00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:41.781
shows that something incredible happened.

283
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:43.741
But other times, they don't.

284
00:11:44.023 --> 00:11:46.121
Authors like Joan Wester Anderson

285
00:11:46.121 --> 00:11:47.748
and Paul Robert Walker

286
00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.099
hear many reports of miracles.

287
00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:52.283
How do they know these stories aren't just

288
00:11:52.283 --> 00:11:54.607
fabrications, or fantasies?

289
00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:57.939
<v ->I look for the authenticity of the person.</v>

290
00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:00.851
What is this person's life been like

291
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.641
since this happened?

292
00:12:02.641 --> 00:12:04.295
Have they changed?

293
00:12:04.295 --> 00:12:06.402
Have the people around them changed

294
00:12:06.402 --> 00:12:08.864
as a result of what they're doing?

295
00:12:08.864 --> 00:12:10.516
<v ->Does this person have anything to gain</v>

296
00:12:10.516 --> 00:12:13.064
by fabricating this story?

297
00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:14.352
You know it's kind of like

298
00:12:14.352 --> 00:12:16.620
what would be the point of making up this story?

299
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.638
But then, when we get into the process

300
00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:21.268
and I start looking at corrections,

301
00:12:21.268 --> 00:12:23.396
I'm always looking to see,

302
00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.944
are the suggestions they're making,

303
00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:28.408
do they seem to be looking to correct the story

304
00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:31.908
for accuracy, or to make it a better story?

305
00:12:31.908 --> 00:12:33.406
Now again and again, I found,

306
00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.710
that the people with whom I was working

307
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.504
were making corrections that in my mind

308
00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:39.798
sometimes made it

309
00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:41.842
somewhat less good of a story,

310
00:12:41.842 --> 00:12:43.662
if I were just making up a story.

311
00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.708
<v ->And then I go forward and try to find</v>

312
00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:48.478
corroborating testimony for it.

313
00:12:48.478 --> 00:12:51.056
I don't usually do that until after I've

314
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.864
gone through this process of discernment

315
00:12:53.864 --> 00:12:55.210
about the person.

316
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.644
From that point on, the story becomes

317
00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:59.772
the property of the reader.

318
00:12:59.772 --> 00:13:01.844
And the reader can decide

319
00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:04.784
whether he or she wants to believe the story or not.

320
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.472
I think it's very important to chronicle

321
00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:09.684
what is going on today.

322
00:13:09.684 --> 00:13:12.876
And it isn't necessary to say,

323
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.304
"That was a miracle,

324
00:13:14.304 --> 00:13:16.740
"this was just a nice coincidence,

325
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.986
"this was important, this isn't."

326
00:13:21.136 --> 00:13:23.320
<v Voiceover>Stories of miracles sometimes appear</v>

327
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.616
to defy the laws of nature.

328
00:13:25.616 --> 00:13:27.632
But one man, Rodney Kephart,

329
00:13:27.632 --> 00:13:30.740
found himself in a strange no-man's-land

330
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.538
of invisible forces 50 years ago.

331
00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:36.312
Caught between two great powers.

332
00:13:36.312 --> 00:13:38.216
Pitted in a historic drama

333
00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:40.008
that would soon unfold for him

334
00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:42.386
in a most unexpected way.

335
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.712
<v ->I arrived at Wake Island in May of '41</v>

336
00:13:51.712 --> 00:13:55.578
as a carpenter working construction

337
00:13:55.578 --> 00:13:58.096 line:15% 
building an air base.

338
00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:02.296 line:15% 
As you know in 1941 on December the 7th,

339
00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:05.931
the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor.

340
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:10.990
(dramatic music)

341
00:14:14.776 --> 00:14:18.040
First warning we had was the airport exploded

342
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.596
and then I rushed out onto the

343
00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:24.536
back of the platform where I was working

344
00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:27.280
at the carpenter shop, and I looked up into the eyes

345
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.444
of the Japanese that were strafing us with

346
00:14:30.444 --> 00:14:32.962
.50 caliber machine guns.

347
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.932
<v Voiceover>Immediately following the attack,</v>

348
00:14:35.932 --> 00:14:38.758
Rodney rushed to the hospital to volunteer his help.

349
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.288
<v ->That night, we run 21 patients</v>

350
00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:45.704
through surgery between nine and one in the morning.

351
00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:49.260
Everything from amputations to shrapnel removal,

352
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.592
and the next morning when I was relieved

353
00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:56.512
I began to look for a place to take some rest,

354
00:14:56.512 --> 00:14:59.396
and there was a room at the end of the corridor

355
00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:02.280
that had two empty beds in it.

356
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.118
And at that point, I approached the room

357
00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:09.530
and it seemed to be extremely light in the room,

358
00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:12.724
and as I approached the door I just seemed

359
00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:15.944
to lose my momentum to go forward,

360
00:15:15.944 --> 00:15:18.268
and there seemed to be a personal force

361
00:15:18.268 --> 00:15:20.370
standing in the doorway

362
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.524
to prevent me from entering,

363
00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:25.324
because I had tried three times to enter,

364
00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:29.106
and the same thing, I couldn't

365
00:15:29.106 --> 00:15:31.566
just couldn't proceed.

366
00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:35.442
(heavenly music)

367
00:15:35.442 --> 00:15:39.558
So, I just felt I better go on down to my barracks

368
00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:42.302
even though it was a half a mile walk

369
00:15:42.302 --> 00:15:45.436
and try to get some rest down there.

370
00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:47.146
<v Voiceover>Exhausted and confused,</v>

371
00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:49.414
Rodney walked back to his own barracks,

372
00:15:49.414 --> 00:15:52.056
giving no further thought to the bizarre incident.

373
00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:53.932
Until he put it together with what he saw

374
00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:55.694
the next morning.

375
00:15:56.312 --> 00:16:00.512
<v ->The Japanese just raided us again and</v>

376
00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:04.348
they dropped an incendiary bomb in the hospital,

377
00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:06.336
it dropped in the room where I had chosen

378
00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:09.862
to go to sleep, and that burned the hospital.

379
00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:14.290
<v Voiceover>Rodney feels that his life was saved</v>

380
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.976
by the unexplainable force which had prevented him

381
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.522
from stepping into that ill-fated room.

382
00:16:22.158 --> 00:16:24.732
<v ->So that looks like one of the reasons</v>

383
00:16:24.732 --> 00:16:27.420
that I'm here today to be able to talk to you,

384
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.718
because my life was spared

385
00:16:29.718 --> 00:16:30.426
by that miracle.

386
00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:35.296
(gentle music)

387
00:16:51.472 --> 00:16:52.704
<v Voiceover>Scholars discuss miracles</v>

388
00:16:52.704 --> 00:16:56.260
in the light of contemporary scientific reasoning.

389
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.304 line:15% 
<v ->From about the 15th or 16th Century on</v>

390
00:16:58.304 --> 00:17:00.574 line:15% 
there began to be a split between

391
00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:02.784 line:15% 
how scientists looked at the world as this

392
00:17:02.784 --> 00:17:05.024
complicated machine and how religious

393
00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.098
moral philosophers were looking for meaning

394
00:17:06.098 --> 00:17:09.400
and values that transcended the purely physical.

395
00:17:09.822 --> 00:17:12.006
And I think that split is now slowly beginning

396
00:17:12.006 --> 00:17:14.946
to heal, scientists are much more aware

397
00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:17.802
of how many presumptions they do have

398
00:17:17.802 --> 00:17:19.650
how much they don't understand,

399
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.450
they've learned a certain amount of humility.

400
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.074
And religious thinkers on the other hand

401
00:17:24.074 --> 00:17:26.454
are trying to understand what they're feeling

402
00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:28.946
and trying to say in terms of what we know

403
00:17:28.946 --> 00:17:31.160
about the universe, and what really is out there

404
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.238
that scientists can tell us makes up reality.

405
00:17:34.238 --> 00:17:35.612
<v Voiceover>Author Paul Robert Walker</v>

406
00:17:35.612 --> 00:17:38.634
comes to his own conclusions about miracles,

407
00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:43.172
based upon his interpretation of scientific research.

408
00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:44.374
<v ->The recent developments in particle physics</v>

409
00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:46.026
are fascinating in this regard,

410
00:17:46.026 --> 00:17:48.714 line:15% 
because they discovered that

411
00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:51.012 line:15% 
the smallest of subatomic particles,

412
00:17:51.012 --> 00:17:53.518 line:15% 
the quark, behaves differently

413
00:17:54.358 --> 00:17:57.384
depending upon the expectations of the observer.

414
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.888
Now what this means is that the universe

415
00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:03.492
is responsive, the physical universe

416
00:18:03.492 --> 00:18:06.354
responds to our own expectations.

417
00:18:07.496 --> 00:18:08.540
Now how much more responsive

418
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.948
might be the non-physical universe?

419
00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:12.908
In a sense, this is what faith is all about,

420
00:18:12.908 --> 00:18:15.484
faith is a willingness to believe

421
00:18:15.484 --> 00:18:17.276
that the universe will indeed respond

422
00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:20.218
to our needs, to our thoughts, to our prayers.

423
00:18:20.218 --> 00:18:22.378 line:15% 
<v ->You know my journey has taken me from</v>

424
00:18:22.378 --> 00:18:25.238 line:15% 
what you might call the more mechanistic approach

425
00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.450 line:15% 
that we're taught in medical school, you know,

426
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.802 line:15% 
how to treat a disease, and that it's been

427
00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:32.770
very much of a spiritual jourey

428
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.550
in the sense of realizing people want help living.

429
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.820
It isn't just getting over their disease.

430
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.122
And as I do this, I keep questioning myself.

431
00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.950
And part of it is when somebody has a disease

432
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.450
disappear, and you say it's a miracle,

433
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.354
and why I even played with that word

434
00:18:50.354 --> 00:18:53.266
in my first book, Love, Medicine &amp; Miracles

435
00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:56.094
to make people think about what is a miracle?

436
00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.438
When someone comes to me with extensive cancer

437
00:18:58.438 --> 00:18:59.820
and we have the path report, and I've operated

438
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.892
on him and I know he isn't cured,

439
00:19:01.892 --> 00:19:04.300
and it's 12 years later he's never had treatment

440
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.682
for cancer, there's no sign of it in his body,

441
00:19:06.682 --> 00:19:08.612
you see is that a miracle?

442
00:19:08.612 --> 00:19:11.729
Or is it something explainable?

443
00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:14.688
Well, I'd say even if we can explain it

444
00:19:14.688 --> 00:19:17.488
it doesn't take it away from miraculous.

445
00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:19.420
<v ->So in that regard, there's always room for miracles,</v>

446
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.306
there's always gonna be things happening

447
00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:24.992
that we don't understand and that we can't explain,

448
00:19:24.992 --> 00:19:26.896
and it doesn't mean that the people who experience

449
00:19:26.896 --> 00:19:28.408
those things are crazy or that they're

450
00:19:28.408 --> 00:19:31.152
religious fanatics, but there are things gonna happen

451
00:19:31.152 --> 00:19:32.860
that we don't understand, and if they strike

452
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.994
you as a miracle, then we need to take that seriously.

453
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.500
(gentle music)

454
00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:44.116
<v Voiceover>One of Jeannie Hunter's facial nerves</v>

455
00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:47.194
was cut during surgery for a tumor in her ear.

456
00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:50.276
As a result, she lost her sensation of taste,

457
00:19:50.276 --> 00:19:52.150
and the hearing in one ear.

458
00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:56.828
Worse yet, Jeannie lost her sense of equilibrium,

459
00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:59.264
and was unable to walk or maintain her balance

460
00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.392
for the better part of each day.

461
00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:04.976 line:15% 
<v ->And I significantly changed my lifestyle</v>

462
00:20:04.976 --> 00:20:07.916 line:15% 
to be just on the couch or in bed

463
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.716 line:15% 
for most of the day and most of the evening.

464
00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:15.196
That was not a very acceptable lifestyle

465
00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:17.688
so I consulted with a second physician,

466
00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:20.878
who offered me no more hope.

467
00:20:21.272 --> 00:20:22.980
<v Voiceover>After four years of suffering,</v>

468
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.052
losing her career and marriage

469
00:20:25.052 --> 00:20:28.300
as a result of her inability to function normally,

470
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.510
Jeannie attended a healing service.

471
00:20:31.876 --> 00:20:34.848
<v ->As I was driving to the church,</v>

472
00:20:34.848 --> 00:20:37.546
I heard very clearly the words,

473
00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:39.796
"This can be the last time that you drive

474
00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:42.076
"to the church sick."

475
00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:44.538
And I was getting kind of excited

476
00:20:44.538 --> 00:20:47.725
'cause I knew that was not my fault.

477
00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:49.735
And then when I got to the church

478
00:20:49.735 --> 00:20:51.683
and began to open the door,

479
00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:53.033
I heard the words again,

480
00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:55.045
"This could be the last time you walk through

481
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.023
"this door sick."

482
00:20:57.023 --> 00:21:00.505
Now I sat and listened to her service,

483
00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:03.596
and she talked about the Holy Spirit,

484
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.935
I did not know the power of God

485
00:21:05.935 --> 00:21:07.585
or healing.

486
00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:10.313
And I sat an hour and a half watching her pray

487
00:21:10.313 --> 00:21:11.993
with other people.

488
00:21:11.993 --> 00:21:14.693
The girls that I had friendships with said,

489
00:21:14.693 --> 00:21:17.545
"We'll ask her to pray with you."

490
00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:19.945
So she laid hands on me,

491
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.735
and then the girls who were there to pray with me

492
00:21:22.735 --> 00:21:26.155
prayed and at the same time my prayer was this,

493
00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:30.053
"Father I ask you to either heal me right now

494
00:21:30.053 --> 00:21:32.993
"or let me die, because I have no life."

495
00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:35.635
And then suddenly, everything became enveloped

496
00:21:35.635 --> 00:21:40.045
in a white cloud, just like a fog rolling in,

497
00:21:40.045 --> 00:21:43.253
and I thought they were in this fog with me.

498
00:21:43.253 --> 00:21:45.205
<v Voiceover>Jeannie underwent what she describes</v>

499
00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:47.515
as an out of body experience,

500
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.885
in which she encountered a warm and healing light.

501
00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:53.573
<v ->They had laid me down on the floor</v>

502
00:21:53.573 --> 00:21:55.945
of the church, I saw my legs

503
00:21:55.945 --> 00:21:58.615
that looked like fluorescent light tubes,

504
00:21:58.615 --> 00:22:01.255
now I know at this point that that was

505
00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:04.193
the Holy Spirit moving in and removing illness

506
00:22:04.193 --> 00:22:05.515
from me.

507
00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:07.125
But at that time,

508
00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:08.550
my thoughts were,

509
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.640
"If I'm on the floor,

510
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.202
"what do I look like?"

511
00:22:13.202 --> 00:22:15.032
'Cause I had all the thought processes

512
00:22:15.032 --> 00:22:16.682
that I have right now.

513
00:22:16.682 --> 00:22:19.113
And I was bending over to see

514
00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:21.602
what exactly did I look like,

515
00:22:21.602 --> 00:22:24.120
suddenly from the right

516
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.992
came a pink white light that spilled out

517
00:22:27.992 --> 00:22:30.422
into triangles.

518
00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:32.822
And from the middle of the light,

519
00:22:32.822 --> 00:22:35.850
came the words, "You are healed."

520
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.762
And I read the words and

521
00:22:38.762 --> 00:22:40.909
for some few minutes they were there,

522
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:42.497
then the Lord sent them to me

523
00:22:42.497 --> 00:22:45.109
and they touched me here.

524
00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:46.879
And I heard him say,

525
00:22:46.879 --> 00:22:48.887
"You are healed."

526
00:22:48.887 --> 00:22:51.169
And then when I awakened,

527
00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:54.686
on the floor, everyone was around me

528
00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:57.118
that had started praying with me,

529
00:22:57.118 --> 00:22:59.897
my hearing aide had come out of my ear,

530
00:22:59.897 --> 00:23:02.938
it was lying on top of my skirt.

531
00:23:02.938 --> 00:23:04.953
And I was trembling,

532
00:23:04.953 --> 00:23:07.898
with just a tremendous amount of surging

533
00:23:07.898 --> 00:23:10.714
that continued because the illness

534
00:23:10.714 --> 00:23:12.570
had gone.

535
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.353
And all of the things that had been wrong

536
00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:16.826
were restored.

537
00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:20.058
I received my balance back,

538
00:23:20.058 --> 00:23:21.882
my hearing was restored,

539
00:23:21.882 --> 00:23:23.497
and the taste grew back.

540
00:23:23.497 --> 00:23:28.259
(gentle music)

541
00:23:34.154 --> 00:23:35.530
So I picked up my daughter

542
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.282
who was 13.

543
00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:40.810
And I told her that the

544
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.105
taste had grown back and we went out to eat.

545
00:23:44.105 --> 00:23:46.314
So while she had ordered a

546
00:23:46.314 --> 00:23:49.258
french vanilla ice cream,

547
00:23:49.258 --> 00:23:51.689
banana pineapple drink,

548
00:23:51.689 --> 00:23:53.194
I'll never forget it.

549
00:23:53.194 --> 00:23:56.265
Because the minute that I took a little sip of this

550
00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:59.529
it was like putting 15 starburst in your mouth

551
00:23:59.529 --> 00:24:01.482
and they just explode and I was going,

552
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:03.274
"Bananas, look bananas are back!"

553
00:24:03.274 --> 00:24:05.290
And I'm going up, I just get up out of the table

554
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.938
run up and down the side of this restaurant,

555
00:24:08.938 --> 00:24:10.954
where no one understands that I'm just now

556
00:24:10.954 --> 00:24:13.578
tasting for the first time in four years,

557
00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:14.999
and I'm trying to get them to drink

558
00:24:14.999 --> 00:24:16.344
from my cup,

559
00:24:16.344 --> 00:24:18.328
they weren't really interested in doing that.

560
00:24:19.178 --> 00:24:21.189
So I just recommended that they go ahead,

561
00:24:21.189 --> 00:24:24.174
order this drink you will not be sorry.

562
00:24:24.948 --> 00:24:26.771
And we came back to start living

563
00:24:26.771 --> 00:24:30.036
and learning how to live well

564
00:24:30.036 --> 00:24:33.684
and having a new hope for being able to share this

565
00:24:33.684 --> 00:24:36.180
that others would know

566
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.574
this is for you today.

567
00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:42.547
The most important part of the whole healing

568
00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:45.332
was knowing that we have a God

569
00:24:45.332 --> 00:24:47.790
who loves us, he's tremendous.

570
00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:53.326
(gentle music)

571
00:24:58.067 --> 00:25:00.276
<v ->In Monterrey, Mexico,</v>

572
00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:02.644
a young woman had a tumor that she described

573
00:25:02.644 --> 00:25:06.547
as being about this big in her lower abdomen,

574
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:09.108 line:15% 
And we prayed with her.

575
00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:12.308 line:15% 
And she had an experience where

576
00:25:12.308 --> 00:25:15.572
she actually saw a light, a white light

577
00:25:15.572 --> 00:25:18.548
enter her body as we were praying.

578
00:25:18.548 --> 00:25:20.723
And that white light went to the tumor

579
00:25:20.723 --> 00:25:23.347
and began to treat the tumor,

580
00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:25.716
to enfold it and she said she could literally

581
00:25:25.716 --> 00:25:29.378
see the tumor disappearing until it was gone.

582
00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:33.346
<v ->When people discuss coming into this light,</v>

583
00:25:33.346 --> 00:25:36.066
I think they are again coming back into this energy

584
00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:37.826
the light is energy.

585
00:25:37.826 --> 00:25:39.778
And so they are becoming a part of it again.

586
00:25:39.778 --> 00:25:41.986
And it is loving, I mean,

587
00:25:41.986 --> 00:25:44.578
I say that, I remember talking to her doctor

588
00:25:44.578 --> 00:25:45.840
over dinner once, saying that,

589
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.783
"My definition of God was intelligent loving energy."

590
00:25:48.783 --> 00:25:50.690
And he's like, "Well how do you know it's loving?

591
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.742
"He'll give an intelligence and he'll give energy to create

592
00:25:55.742 --> 00:25:57.182
"but how do you know it's loving?"

593
00:25:57.182 --> 00:26:00.317
I said, "Because if I incise somebody

594
00:26:00.317 --> 00:26:02.813
"with a knife, they heal.

595
00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:04.830
"And if God didn't love me,

596
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.293
"or my patient, they would bleed to death

597
00:26:07.293 --> 00:26:08.510
"and die of an infection."

598
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.678
So we have this built in ability to heal.

599
00:26:11.678 --> 00:26:14.397
But again, I'd get back to the state of that person,

600
00:26:14.397 --> 00:26:16.637
their consciousness, their energy,

601
00:26:16.637 --> 00:26:18.974
their love, their faith, all those

602
00:26:18.974 --> 00:26:21.036
relate to healing.

603
00:26:21.036 --> 00:26:25.990
(gentle music)

604
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.180
(dramatic music)

605
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.299
<v ->In exploring historical miracles,</v>

606
00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:41.529
I wanted to find stories where there was

607
00:26:41.529 --> 00:26:43.641
some sort of contemporary corroboration

608
00:26:43.641 --> 00:26:45.177
of the events involved.

609
00:26:45.177 --> 00:26:47.449
The earliest story in the book

610
00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:49.689
is a story of St. Francis of Asisi,

611
00:26:49.689 --> 00:26:52.537
dates back to 1224 AD

612
00:26:52.537 --> 00:26:55.161
at a time when Francis was on a retreat

613
00:26:55.161 --> 00:26:57.403
in the Apennine Mountains in Italy

614
00:26:57.403 --> 00:27:00.857
at a place called Laverne, a wildly desolate place

615
00:27:00.857 --> 00:27:03.864
where Francis hoped to come to terms

616
00:27:03.864 --> 00:27:06.072
with himself and with God.

617
00:27:06.072 --> 00:27:07.257
Now as the story was told,

618
00:27:07.257 --> 00:27:09.305
Francis was praying one night outside a cave

619
00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:12.248
when a flaming angel came down from Heaven

620
00:27:12.248 --> 00:27:15.080
holding an image of Christ on the cross.

621
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.864
The angel touched Francis with the cross,

622
00:27:17.864 --> 00:27:20.457
and Francis developed the stigmata.

623
00:27:20.457 --> 00:27:22.729
Which are the wounds

624
00:27:22.729 --> 00:27:25.192
that Christ suffered on the cross.

625
00:27:25.192 --> 00:27:27.112
Now the story of the flaming angel

626
00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:29.992
of course sounds like it could be folkloric,

627
00:27:29.992 --> 00:27:32.073
but there were two interesting instances

628
00:27:32.073 --> 00:27:33.832
of contemporary corroboration.

629
00:27:33.832 --> 00:27:36.105
One of Francis's followers who was with him

630
00:27:36.105 --> 00:27:39.112
on the retreat reported that he saw

631
00:27:39.112 --> 00:27:41.225
a ball of fire coming from the sky,

632
00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:44.457
and enveloping Francis.

633
00:27:44.457 --> 00:27:47.400
Also, the villagers who lived in a small village

634
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.840
at the base of the mountain

635
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.920
reported seeing the sky lit

636
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.600
as brightly as if it were the rising sun that night.

637
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.961
So both of those reports seem to indicate

638
00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:00.360
that something very unusual and mystical had occurred.

639
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.241
Now, after they came down from Laverne,

640
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:05.960
many people saw Francis's stigmata,

641
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.496
and there's really no question that Francis

642
00:28:07.496 --> 00:28:10.050
did indeed develop stigmata.

643
00:28:11.912 --> 00:28:14.793
<v ->Leprosy in Bible times and in St. Francis's time</v>

644
00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:18.377
was just an awesomely horrible disease,

645
00:28:18.377 --> 00:28:20.617
people would throw rocks at lepers

646
00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:22.376
and urge them to get out,

647
00:28:22.376 --> 00:28:23.816
it was unclean.

648
00:28:23.816 --> 00:28:25.481
And people were just mystified by it

649
00:28:25.481 --> 00:28:27.016
they won't have anything to do with it.

650
00:28:27.016 --> 00:28:29.256
But St. Francis and his followers would go out

651
00:28:29.256 --> 00:28:32.523 line:15% 
to the leper colonies and minister to these men

652
00:28:32.523 --> 00:28:36.233 line:15% 
giving them food and other forms of comfort,

653
00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:39.001 line:15% 
but there was one fellow there who was just

654
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:41.205
so bitter in spirit and so grouchy

655
00:28:41.205 --> 00:28:43.733
that none of St. Francis's followers

656
00:28:43.733 --> 00:28:45.174
wanted to even be near the fella,

657
00:28:45.174 --> 00:28:46.550
and they'd finally just given up on him,

658
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.990
they thought he was unreachable.

659
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.841
So St. Francis said, "I'll care for him."

660
00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:51.017
And he went in there,

661
00:28:51.017 --> 00:28:52.223
and it's one of my favorite stories,

662
00:28:52.223 --> 00:28:53.987
because he looked at the man, and he said,

663
00:28:53.987 --> 00:28:56.505
"What can I do for you?"

664
00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:57.937
And the man said,

665
00:28:57.937 --> 00:29:00.233
"Nobody wants to come near me,

666
00:29:00.233 --> 00:29:02.053
"they think that I rot.

667
00:29:02.053 --> 00:29:03.985
"I would like you to bathe me."

668
00:29:04.715 --> 00:29:06.535
And St. Francis did that,

669
00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:09.335
and as he in that ultimate expression of compassion

670
00:29:09.335 --> 00:29:13.339
began to use his own hands to wash the man,

671
00:29:13.339 --> 00:29:14.935
the leprosy was cured.

672
00:29:14.935 --> 00:29:19.935
(gentle music)

673
00:29:30.727 --> 00:29:33.497
<v ->At the time of the Protestant Reformation,</v>

674
00:29:33.497 --> 00:29:36.243
many of those leaders

675
00:29:36.243 --> 00:29:39.323 line:15% 
felt that miracles were over.

676
00:29:39.323 --> 00:29:41.983 line:15% 
The age of miracles had happened already,

677
00:29:41.983 --> 00:29:44.335
and that there was no reason for them

678
00:29:44.335 --> 00:29:47.247
to continue, and that they were not continuing.

679
00:29:47.247 --> 00:29:49.907
Many of them eventually changed their minds.

680
00:29:49.907 --> 00:29:54.357
Or their successors did, but there are churches today

681
00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:56.672
who still believe that there are no such things

682
00:29:56.672 --> 00:29:58.111
as miracles.

683
00:29:58.111 --> 00:30:02.368 line:15% 
<v ->Now having a lot of people being spiritual</v>

684
00:30:02.368 --> 00:30:06.720 line:15% 
claiming miracles, using intuition

685
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.727
has a tendency of

686
00:30:09.727 --> 00:30:13.247
dispensing authority in all directions.

687
00:30:13.247 --> 00:30:16.194
And it is a threat to the religious organizations,

688
00:30:16.194 --> 00:30:19.583
to the church, to a clerical community,

689
00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:21.631
to the rabbinical community.

690
00:30:21.631 --> 00:30:25.344
And therefore not that encouraged.

691
00:30:26.944 --> 00:30:31.753
(gentle guitar)

692
00:30:36.748 --> 00:30:41.748
(clapping and chanting)

693
00:30:47.405 --> 00:30:48.716
<v ->We'd been studying the Bible</v>

694
00:30:48.716 --> 00:30:50.541
where Jesus said,

695
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:52.332
"When you give a lunch or dinner

696
00:30:52.332 --> 00:30:53.772
"don't invite your rich friends,

697
00:30:53.772 --> 00:30:55.404
"your neighbors, or your relatives.

698
00:30:55.404 --> 00:30:56.940
"Invite those people that can never

699
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.861
"invite you back, the poor,

700
00:30:58.861 --> 00:31:02.668
"the crippled, the blind, the lame.

701
00:31:02.668 --> 00:31:05.068 line:15% 
"And your Father in Heaven will reward you."

702
00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:07.980 line:15% 
So I said, "Well I've never done that

703
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.900
"strictly and literally.

704
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.077
"We've fed a lot of people for a long time

705
00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:13.708
"but we've never done it just that way

706
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.501
"so let's do it on Christmas."

707
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.555
And so, I said,

708
00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:19.931
"I'm gonna do it on Christmas if anybody

709
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:22.843
"wants to come, come on."

710
00:31:22.843 --> 00:31:25.051
<v ->The ladies made burritos, tamales,</v>

711
00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:27.578
bags of Christmas candy, cookies,

712
00:31:27.578 --> 00:31:29.658 line:15% 
and oranges and stuff.

713
00:31:29.658 --> 00:31:33.754 line:15% 
Christmas day, we meet in front of the

714
00:31:33.754 --> 00:31:35.355
Anton of Our Lady Youth Center

715
00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:37.499
all of these trucks, and cars, and people,

716
00:31:37.499 --> 00:31:40.042
and they bring all of this food.

717
00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:43.229
Some ladies brought some cake.

718
00:31:43.229 --> 00:31:45.631
They had made cakes.

719
00:31:45.631 --> 00:31:48.361
And I brought 25 bologna sandwiches,

720
00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:50.401
that's two loaves of bread,

721
00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:52.981
that makes exactly 25 sandwiches.

722
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:55.801
A lady had brought a ham, a big ham.

723
00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:58.478
We load all our vans up,

724
00:31:58.478 --> 00:31:59.558
our trucks and everything,

725
00:31:59.558 --> 00:32:01.326
and then we crossed the border.

726
00:32:01.326 --> 00:32:03.788
<v ->To my surprise, they were all working</v>

727
00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:06.606
in the garbage, and they had no idea

728
00:32:06.606 --> 00:32:08.168
it was Christmas.

729
00:32:08.168 --> 00:32:10.296
To them, every day was the same,

730
00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:12.308
they didn't know, there was no Sunday, Monday,

731
00:32:12.308 --> 00:32:15.246
Tuesday, or holidays, every day was the same.

732
00:32:15.246 --> 00:32:17.438
Christmas included.

733
00:32:17.438 --> 00:32:19.688
And they tried to eek out a living

734
00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:21.678
grubbing through the garbage.

735
00:32:22.328 --> 00:32:24.488
<v Frank>I've been in war, I was in the Korean War</v>

736
00:32:24.488 --> 00:32:25.765
and I've seen things, you know,

737
00:32:25.765 --> 00:32:28.463
but this shocked me, this was really shocking.

738
00:32:28.463 --> 00:32:30.983
<v Thomas>The condition of the people was terrible.</v>

739
00:32:30.983 --> 00:32:32.995
We found out later that every single

740
00:32:32.995 --> 00:32:36.235
man woman and child on the dump had tuberculosis.

741
00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:37.735
<v Voiceover>Father Thomas was accustomed</v>

742
00:32:37.735 --> 00:32:39.685
to estimating the amount of food needed

743
00:32:39.685 --> 00:32:41.545
to feed a large crowd.

744
00:32:41.545 --> 00:32:43.645
But the turnout that day was more than

745
00:32:43.645 --> 00:32:45.999
three times what he had expected.

746
00:32:46.525 --> 00:32:48.443
<v Thomas>I had thought it would be 120 there,</v>

747
00:32:48.443 --> 00:32:50.273
there were a lot more.

748
00:32:50.273 --> 00:32:51.715
We said, "We don't have enough food,

749
00:32:51.715 --> 00:32:54.565
"but we'll share what we got."

750
00:32:54.565 --> 00:32:55.765
<v ->They had broken out this big ham</v>

751
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:58.015
and they put it on the tailgate of my truck.

752
00:32:58.015 --> 00:33:00.353
And this lady starts to cut the ham,

753
00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:01.755
she's cutting and cutting and cutting,

754
00:33:01.755 --> 00:33:03.127
and giving out the pieces,

755
00:33:03.127 --> 00:33:04.805
and I see everybody walking around with

756
00:33:04.805 --> 00:33:06.935
a burrito, a tamale, a sandwich,

757
00:33:06.935 --> 00:33:08.615
a piece of ham in their hand,

758
00:33:08.615 --> 00:33:10.239
having a good time

759
00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:11.945
just having a wonderful time.

760
00:33:11.945 --> 00:33:14.857
<v ->After a while, this young man came to me</v>

761
00:33:14.857 --> 00:33:17.477
with a big slice of ham in his hand,

762
00:33:18.477 --> 00:33:20.612
and he said, "Have some ham."

763
00:33:20.612 --> 00:33:22.862
And I said, "No there's not enough."

764
00:33:22.862 --> 00:33:24.724
He said, "Yeah there is."

765
00:33:24.724 --> 00:33:25.954
And so I said, "There can't be."

766
00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:27.302
He said, "Well look."

767
00:33:27.302 --> 00:33:29.162
And I looked around there was people had

768
00:33:29.162 --> 00:33:30.814
big slice of ham in their hands

769
00:33:30.814 --> 00:33:33.574
about as big as a half inch of ham.

770
00:33:33.574 --> 00:33:35.554
Well that didn't register.

771
00:33:35.554 --> 00:33:37.354
<v ->And I'm looking around seeing all of these</v>

772
00:33:37.354 --> 00:33:39.305
wonderful things happening,

773
00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:41.554
at the side of my pickup on the ground

774
00:33:41.554 --> 00:33:43.024
this lady was giving out the little

775
00:33:43.024 --> 00:33:45.334
Christmas bags of candy for the kids.

776
00:33:46.059 --> 00:33:47.769
They'd get a bag and they'd run out

777
00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:49.511
and they'd put them in a box in a paper sack,

778
00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:51.401
and then they'd get back in line.

779
00:33:51.401 --> 00:33:52.110
Well I figured for sure we're gonna

780
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.210
run out of candy, and I hollered down to Jean,

781
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.100
I said, "Jean we're gonna run out of candy,

782
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.270
"look what they're doing."

783
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.950
Well she couldn't control it,

784
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.360
she just shrugged her shoulders.

785
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.920
<v ->I was taking pictures of children,</v>

786
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.410
boys with sacks of food,

787
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.958
and they would come and fill their sacks up,

788
00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:09.240
take 'em home, empty their sacks,

789
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.369
and come back for another sack of food.

790
00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:14.318
Well, it took

791
00:34:15.238 --> 00:34:18.869
several hours for all this to penetrate my mind,

792
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:21.720
you know, as everybody began to share.

793
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.930
<v Voiceover>Father Thomas stopped keeping count</v>

794
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.480
when the crowd surpassed 400 people

795
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.340
who came for the Christmas meal

796
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.840
originally planned to feed 120.

797
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.088
<v ->It didn't occur to us until after we had come back</v>

798
00:34:36.088 --> 00:34:37.800
of the miracle that had happened,

799
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.050
because we knew what he had taken across,

800
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.908
and we knew what we had given,

801
00:34:41.908 --> 00:34:43.140
we saw with our own eyes

802
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.700
all the people that were there.

803
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.170
And we saw what was left over after

804
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.700
everybody had gone home.

805
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.289
Where we even had enough to go take down

806
00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:51.168
to the orphanage, that was truly

807
00:34:51.168 --> 00:34:53.428
a wonderful wonderful thing.

808
00:34:53.428 --> 00:34:55.458
<v ->We stopped on the way back to El Paso</v>

809
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:59.852
at an orphanage in Juarez and left the food there.

810
00:34:59.852 --> 00:35:03.016
I found out a long time later

811
00:35:03.016 --> 00:35:07.252
that a person from Juarez had food left over

812
00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.504
and they had stopped at another orphanage

813
00:35:09.504 --> 00:35:12.454
to leave the food that was left over.

814
00:35:13.072 --> 00:35:14.694
And this really got our attention,

815
00:35:14.694 --> 00:35:17.064
and we said, "Well if God multiplied that food,

816
00:35:17.864 --> 00:35:19.410
"that's a sign that we have to go back

817
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.240
"and help those people."

818
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.289
And so that was the beginning

819
00:35:22.289 --> 00:35:24.420
of a ministry at the garbage dump

820
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.240
that's gone on even to this day.

821
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.240
(gentle music)

822
00:35:32.969 --> 00:35:34.560
<v Frank>Yeah over there, that's a cut away of</v>

823
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.330
what they're all living on top of,

824
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.950
that's what the garbage,

825
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.870
the old garbage, that's been there for years

826
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.029
and they just built on top of the garbage.

827
00:35:42.029 --> 00:35:43.380
They haven't got any running water.

828
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.020
But they got barrels here.

829
00:35:46.657 --> 00:35:49.247
If you can see all of these homes right here

830
00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:51.528
and off in the distance, way in the distance,

831
00:35:51.528 --> 00:35:53.816
you see the United States of America.

832
00:35:54.286 --> 00:35:55.786
30 minutes from right here

833
00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.068
to the wealthiest nation in the world,

834
00:35:58.068 --> 00:35:59.453
they have all of this.

835
00:35:59.453 --> 00:36:01.043
<v Voiceover>Frank Alarcon was so touched</v>

836
00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:03.025
by what he saw happen that day,

837
00:36:03.025 --> 00:36:05.425
he took it as a sign that he should stay

838
00:36:05.425 --> 00:36:08.615
in Juarez and help the poor people in that town.

839
00:36:08.993 --> 00:36:10.735
<v ->That evening when I went home,</v>

840
00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.985
and I went in my room and I closed the door

841
00:36:12.985 --> 00:36:14.854
and on my knees I begged God for a job,

842
00:36:14.854 --> 00:36:17.672
with tears in my eyes, I was so in love

843
00:36:17.672 --> 00:36:19.634
that, I was so in love.

844
00:36:20.224 --> 00:36:22.054
<v Voiceover>He left behind a comfortable retirement</v>

845
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:24.542
in the US, and organized a daycare,

846
00:36:24.542 --> 00:36:26.884
a doctor's and dentist office,

847
00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.354
and other services.

848
00:36:28.354 --> 00:36:30.484
<v ->That's your pharmacy over there.</v>

849
00:36:30.484 --> 00:36:32.432
We charge 10 pesos a visit,

850
00:36:32.432 --> 00:36:34.294
and we give them the medicines

851
00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:35.944
if we have them, if we don't,

852
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:37.924
then the doctor will make out a prescription for them

853
00:36:37.924 --> 00:36:40.052
to buy, if they don't have the money, fine,

854
00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:42.214
if they don't then we'll buy it for them.

855
00:36:42.214 --> 00:36:44.312
And the same way with the dentist,

856
00:36:44.312 --> 00:36:45.549
if they have the money, if they don't

857
00:36:45.549 --> 00:36:47.351
they still get treatment.

858
00:36:47.351 --> 00:36:48.318
See the white building

859
00:36:48.318 --> 00:36:49.733
with all those barrels on top?

860
00:36:49.733 --> 00:36:51.743
I have a little room in back of there.

861
00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:53.483
<v Voiceover>He now lives in a one room dwelling</v>

862
00:36:53.483 --> 00:36:55.705
with a single light bulb, and a mattress

863
00:36:55.705 --> 00:36:57.056
on a dirt floor.

864
00:36:57.056 --> 00:36:58.865
<v ->Super room.</v>

865
00:36:59.605 --> 00:37:02.155
This is where we celebrated Christmas 1972,

866
00:37:02.155 --> 00:37:03.625
right here.

867
00:37:03.625 --> 00:37:05.903
And it was just a beautiful wonderful day.

868
00:37:05.903 --> 00:37:09.145
I couldn't, I thank God for that Christmas,

869
00:37:09.145 --> 00:37:11.913
it changed my life.

870
00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.825
I can't take any credit for anything,

871
00:37:13.825 --> 00:37:15.476
I dare not take credit for anything,

872
00:37:15.476 --> 00:37:18.685
because I'm not capable of those things.

873
00:37:18.685 --> 00:37:20.615
These are just wonders that God has done.

874
00:37:22.225 --> 00:37:24.083
<v Voiceover>When our film crew went out to investigate</v>

875
00:37:24.083 --> 00:37:25.913
these stories at the Lord's Ranch,

876
00:37:25.913 --> 00:37:28.812
they were greeted by something quite unexpected.

877
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.922
<v ->We just arrived here, and I told our cameraman</v>

878
00:37:31.922 --> 00:37:34.832
that we needed to shoot a dark sky

879
00:37:34.832 --> 00:37:36.182
because when we get home,

880
00:37:36.182 --> 00:37:39.120 line:15% 
I'm planning to superimpose a rainbow for an effect,

881
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.182 line:15% 
and not 30 seconds later,

882
00:37:42.182 --> 00:37:46.080
we turned and saw this most beautiful double rainbow

883
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.862
I've ever seen in my life.

884
00:37:48.362 --> 00:37:51.422
<v ->This is a sign that the Lord has given you</v>

885
00:37:51.422 --> 00:37:54.192
to show you what he does here.

886
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.552
He performs miracles here,

887
00:37:56.552 --> 00:37:58.431
and this is His sign to you.

888
00:37:58.431 --> 00:38:00.181
That rainbow.

889
00:38:01.759 --> 00:38:02.971
(mumbles)

890
00:38:03.919 --> 00:38:08.699
(gentle music)

891
00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:14.101
(calm organ)

892
00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:19.471
(suspenseful music)

893
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.398
<v ->Richard Musielak's son Paul</v>

894
00:38:39.398 --> 00:38:42.790
was caught in a mugging situation,

895
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.768 line:15% 
and he was beaten very badly,

896
00:38:44.768 --> 00:38:46.728 line:15% 
Richard got the call that night that

897
00:38:47.689 --> 00:38:50.389 line:15% 
Paul was in the hospital with terrible damage

898
00:38:50.389 --> 00:38:52.037
to his head and face.

899
00:38:52.037 --> 00:38:54.739 line:15% 
<v ->I could not believe what I saw.</v>

900
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:59.299 line:15% 
His eyes were bleeding, they were

901
00:39:00.449 --> 00:39:02.844
so swollen shut and so swollen

902
00:39:02.844 --> 00:39:06.566
out of proportion that he looked like some

903
00:39:06.566 --> 00:39:07.804
strange creature.

904
00:39:08.484 --> 00:39:09.906
Literally out to here.

905
00:39:11.306 --> 00:39:13.653
And, blood all over his face,

906
00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:16.023
he just looked like a piece of raw meat that

907
00:39:16.023 --> 00:39:17.833
had just been slaughtered.

908
00:39:20.263 --> 00:39:22.023
He was still conscious,

909
00:39:22.023 --> 00:39:23.202
of course they couldn't give 'em anything

910
00:39:23.202 --> 00:39:26.682
for the pain because it was trauma to the head.

911
00:39:26.682 --> 00:39:29.602
And, I...

912
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.422
Almost immediately became extremely angry

913
00:39:34.422 --> 00:39:36.522
who would do this to my son?

914
00:39:36.522 --> 00:39:37.962
And he related the story then as to

915
00:39:37.962 --> 00:39:39.220
what happened, he said,

916
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.962
"Dad, I simply got out of the car

917
00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:42.760
"and I turned around and wham.

918
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.903
"Someone hit me, and apparently hit me more

919
00:39:46.903 --> 00:39:48.353
"than a couple of times."

920
00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:52.365
<v ->Richard was filled with a white hot anger</v>

921
00:39:52.365 --> 00:39:54.105
to get these guys,

922
00:39:54.105 --> 00:39:56.595
and he went looking for them all day Saturday

923
00:39:56.595 --> 00:39:58.253
and couldn't find them.

924
00:39:58.935 --> 00:40:00.345
Talked to people on the street,

925
00:40:00.345 --> 00:40:01.965
offered a reward, anything,

926
00:40:01.965 --> 00:40:05.085
he said, "I was going to break their kneecaps first,

927
00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:07.943
"before I gave them to the police."

928
00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:11.715
I think that would be a natural reaction for anyone.

929
00:40:11.715 --> 00:40:13.875
But the following day,

930
00:40:13.875 --> 00:40:16.573
he went to church with the baseball bat

931
00:40:16.573 --> 00:40:17.923
in his car.

932
00:40:17.923 --> 00:40:21.595
<v ->Wouldn't you know the homily that day was on forgiveness.</v>

933
00:40:24.135 --> 00:40:25.703
And, I...

934
00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:29.893
I still get a little choked up about it,

935
00:40:29.893 --> 00:40:33.203
but in my pew...

936
00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:36.985
I uh...

937
00:40:38.085 --> 00:40:41.263
Made a conscious decision

938
00:40:41.263 --> 00:40:43.005
to forgive those people,

939
00:40:43.005 --> 00:40:45.715
whoever they were, and uh...

940
00:40:47.715 --> 00:40:49.225
Not to pursue

941
00:40:50.773 --> 00:40:53.934
the vindictive type of behavior that I was.

942
00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:55.102
And while I was sitting there,

943
00:40:55.102 --> 00:40:59.154
I recall that I had to forgive those people too

944
00:40:59.154 --> 00:41:01.672
because I couldn't pray for my son's healing

945
00:41:03.542 --> 00:41:07.072
if I held something against someone else.

946
00:41:07.072 --> 00:41:09.482
So, I forgave, and...

947
00:41:10.912 --> 00:41:13.241
I prayed for my son's healing.

948
00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:18.629
And, I asked the Lord to take it from my memory,

949
00:41:18.629 --> 00:41:20.679
I mean the bad feelings.

950
00:41:21.361 --> 00:41:22.601
And he did.

951
00:41:22.921 --> 00:41:24.071
Anyway I went to...

952
00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:27.719
I went to the hospital that morning

953
00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.749
and upon exiting the elevator,

954
00:41:30.749 --> 00:41:32.159
one of the nurses spotted me

955
00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:33.769
and said, "Mr. Musielak, it's your son."

956
00:41:33.769 --> 00:41:34.697
<v Voiceover>We can't explain it,</v>

957
00:41:34.697 --> 00:41:36.229
we don't know how it happened.

958
00:41:36.229 --> 00:41:38.989
<v ->And I didn't remember exactly how I took that,</v>

959
00:41:38.989 --> 00:41:42.107
but I kinda trotted the rest of the way

960
00:41:42.107 --> 00:41:44.027
to the room.

961
00:41:44.027 --> 00:41:46.757
There I saw Paul, the swelling had gone down

962
00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:49.607
and he had opened his eyes.

963
00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:51.499
By this time of course a lot of the blood

964
00:41:51.499 --> 00:41:53.599
was already cleaned up off of his face and such,

965
00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:57.199
but I mean in and of itself

966
00:41:57.199 --> 00:42:00.079
it was like a miracle that he was actually

967
00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:03.409
able to open his eyes and the swelling had gone down.

968
00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:07.157
So then on Monday, we went back to the hospital

969
00:42:09.837 --> 00:42:11.399
to take Paul home.

970
00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:14.729
And, were amazed really.

971
00:42:15.979 --> 00:42:20.009
In seeing Paul with only bloodshot eyes.

972
00:42:21.437 --> 00:42:24.349
Not a contusion, not any evidence of

973
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:26.569
any scratch or harm or beating at all.

974
00:42:27.686 --> 00:42:29.456
The swelling was completely gone down,

975
00:42:29.456 --> 00:42:31.294
he was in fine spirits.

976
00:42:31.857 --> 00:42:34.406
Later I found the report, the doctor's report

977
00:42:34.406 --> 00:42:38.126
about the exit x-ray of Paul.

978
00:42:38.126 --> 00:42:42.834
And when on Saturday there was a fractured skull,

979
00:42:42.834 --> 00:42:45.026
evidence of a fractured skull by x-ray.

980
00:42:45.026 --> 00:42:47.216
On Monday there was no evidence

981
00:42:47.216 --> 00:42:48.694
of any fracture at all.

982
00:42:49.314 --> 00:42:52.436
<v ->Most people focus on Paul,</v>

983
00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:56.036
and the marvelous restoration of Paul's face.

984
00:42:56.036 --> 00:42:58.194
Which of course is a miracle.

985
00:42:58.194 --> 00:43:00.026
But I would have a tendency to think that

986
00:43:00.026 --> 00:43:04.086
the other miracle was the healing of Richard's heart.

987
00:43:04.764 --> 00:43:07.536
On faith, he finally was able to

988
00:43:09.273 --> 00:43:11.851
just throw away his baseball bat and his plans

989
00:43:11.851 --> 00:43:14.503
for revenge, and...

990
00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:18.003
After that, his miracle happened.

991
00:43:18.003 --> 00:43:23.003
(gentle piano)

992
00:43:24.303 --> 00:43:26.403
<v Voiceover>A miracle is something that appears</v>

993
00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:29.284
to be unexplainable by the laws of nature,

994
00:43:29.284 --> 00:43:32.253
and so it thought to be supernatural in origin.

995
00:43:32.253 --> 00:43:33.881
Or, an act of God.

996
00:43:34.473 --> 00:43:36.273
The stories we just heard speak of

997
00:43:36.273 --> 00:43:38.523
profound and life-changing events,

998
00:43:38.523 --> 00:43:40.653
and phenomenal experiences

999
00:43:40.653 --> 00:43:43.901
that appear to be unexplainable by the laws of nature.

1000
00:43:44.461 --> 00:43:45.901
For the people who live them,

1001
00:43:45.901 --> 00:43:47.131
they are quite simply

1002
00:43:47.131 --> 00:43:49.993
their own personal stories of miracles.

1003
00:43:52.083 --> 00:43:54.301
<v ->The thing that we have to understand is that</v>

1004
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:56.583
most of us have been brought up to think

1005
00:43:56.583 --> 00:43:59.191
in terms of reason,

1006
00:44:00.398 --> 00:44:03.790
rationality, to look at things philosophically

1007
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.190
rather than theologically,

1008
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.428
and while both philosophy and theology

1009
00:44:09.778 --> 00:44:11.629
will deal with some of the same questions

1010
00:44:11.629 --> 00:44:13.579
and the same issues, their starting point

1011
00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:15.169
is entirely different.

1012
00:44:15.169 --> 00:44:17.329
Philosophy begins with reason,

1013
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:20.357
theology begins with faith.

1014
00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:21.920
Faith doesn't require proof

1015
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.969
or it wouldn't be faith.

1016
00:44:26.419 --> 00:44:28.789
<v ->So often in miracles</v>

1017
00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:30.329
we see that um...

1018
00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.529
Sometimes the power of prayer,

1019
00:44:33.529 --> 00:44:35.659
it's brought on by someone else,

1020
00:44:35.659 --> 00:44:37.877
and I think we forget that the power of prayer

1021
00:44:37.877 --> 00:44:41.149
is beautiful in that a lot of us can get together

1022
00:44:41.149 --> 00:44:42.989
and pray for one person.

1023
00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:47.667
<v ->For those who can live their life</v>

1024
00:44:48.448 --> 00:44:50.308
putting out unconditional love to all those

1025
00:44:50.308 --> 00:44:53.786
around them, that kind of agape love

1026
00:44:53.786 --> 00:44:57.866
and certainly living a life of loving God.

1027
00:44:59.013 --> 00:45:01.293
I think those people probably experience miracles,

1028
00:45:01.293 --> 00:45:04.053
little amazing coincidences all the time,

1029
00:45:04.053 --> 00:45:07.503
and I think the closer we get to that ideal,

1030
00:45:07.503 --> 00:45:09.945
the more likely we are to experience miracles.

1031
00:45:11.763 --> 00:45:13.295
<v ->People are looking for answers,</v>

1032
00:45:13.295 --> 00:45:16.113
I think in the last couple decades

1033
00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:18.063
we thought science really was gonna be able to

1034
00:45:18.063 --> 00:45:19.895
provide us with answers, and we're gonna find cures

1035
00:45:19.895 --> 00:45:21.725
for all these diseases that we're really gonna

1036
00:45:21.725 --> 00:45:23.825
understand how the physical world operates,

1037
00:45:23.825 --> 00:45:25.983
and now we're not so sure if science can provide

1038
00:45:25.983 --> 00:45:27.635
those answers, so we're looking for other places of

1039
00:45:27.635 --> 00:45:29.615
how we might try better to understand

1040
00:45:29.615 --> 00:45:31.473
what the world is like,

1041
00:45:31.473 --> 00:45:34.475
and how cures can be affected.

1042
00:45:34.475 --> 00:45:36.483
And religion is providing a certain amount

1043
00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:38.252
of answers and people are finding miracles

1044
00:45:38.252 --> 00:45:39.814
or things that strike them as miracles

1045
00:45:39.814 --> 00:45:41.790
as something that's very interesting

1046
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.012
that might indicate that there is more to reality out there

1047
00:45:45.012 --> 00:45:46.692
than scientists can tell us.

1048
00:45:48.002 --> 00:45:49.848
<v ->Miracles happen every day.</v>

1049
00:45:49.848 --> 00:45:53.480
And it doesn't have to be at a terrific accident site.

1050
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.972
It could be something as small as

1051
00:45:56.972 --> 00:45:58.066
giving somebody a smile.

1052
00:45:58.066 --> 00:46:00.408
You don't know if that person's gonna be down or not,

1053
00:46:00.408 --> 00:46:03.578
and that smile could be what changes that person's

1054
00:46:04.418 --> 00:46:07.185
course in life, that yeah somebody does care for me.

1055
00:46:07.635 --> 00:46:10.261
And that's how these miracles happen

1056
00:46:10.261 --> 00:46:12.055
is by caring for each other,

1057
00:46:12.055 --> 00:46:13.501
and that's why we're here.

1058
00:46:15.827 --> 00:46:17.907
<v ->The greatest deterrent to a miracle</v>

1059
00:46:17.907 --> 00:46:19.743
is intellect and logic.

1060
00:46:20.715 --> 00:46:22.561
But if you get in touch with the intuitive,

1061
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:24.745
creative energy forces

1062
00:46:25.694 --> 00:46:27.202
that exist in this universe,

1063
00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:29.014
that's when you can have a miracle.

1064
00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:35.287
(dramatic music)
