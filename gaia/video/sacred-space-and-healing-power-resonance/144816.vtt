00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Resonance is the
key to everything.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:84%
When two organisms share
the same resonance,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
information is
exchanged between them.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Understand this, and you'll come
to know what ancient temples

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:90%
can do for you and to you.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the great
secrets of the mysteries.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's what lies
behind sacred sites

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and the healing
power of resonance.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we can't help
being attracted and distracted

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
by the visual beauty
of ancient temples

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
and other sacred places.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
We marvel at their
physical characteristics,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
admire their ornamentation,
stand in awe of their elegance.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And yet behind their
outward appearance,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot more going on.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, for
example, the temple

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
was not regarded as
a physical object,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
but looked upon as a
living entity to the point

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:84%
where prayers were
conducted at dawn by priests

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
who walked every room
chanting, as though rousing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
a sleeping being from slumber.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Their architects
describe how temples

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
were designed for
times when people

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
lost their connection to the
elemental world around them.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:84%
The temple was there as a
reminder of their godliness

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:90%
without religious overtones.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
You could say the temples are
the original self-help centers,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
particularly when they share
a rich history of healing.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
The idea that sacred sites
have curative properties

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:90%
is an ancient one.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years, people
have visited these temples

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to interact with their
energy, particularly those

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
in need of improving
their well-being.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
Such a long
tradition, obviously,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
proves there is something
about them that works.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Even today, mothers still
take their sick children

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
to these standing
stones and pass them

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
through the ring seven
times, in accordance

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:90%
with the local legend.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.716 align:middle line:84%
It's like a neolithic version
of a CAT scan and a lot cheaper.

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It is true that this type of
stone chosen for this temple

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
is naturally radioactive--

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
just enough to trigger
the body's immune system

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and eradicate harmful bacteria.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So these pilgrims, both
ancient and modern, were right.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
There is an invisible technology
at work behind the scenes.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Similar miracles
have been taking

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
place for over 4,000 years
at Saint [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:84%
a site once used by the
Anasazi, who came here

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:90%
to use its healing mud.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Although it is now a
highly Christianized site,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
the efficacious soil
is still sought after.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And judging by the
number of crutches

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
discarded inside the church,
clearly, it still works.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
This healing ability is
also true of sacred springs.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
These are the
original sacred sites.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Later, they were
adapted into holy wells

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and each well is associated
with a specific cure.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Some work for the eyes, others
for liver, limbs, even rickets.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
One famous holy-well lies
beneath Chartres Cathedral.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And long before this magnificent
building was erected--

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:84%
even before the
times of druids--

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
people undertook pilgrimage here
to drink the curative water.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
After all, there
is a good reason

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
why this is called the
Well of the Strong.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
The effectiveness
of the water is

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
due in part to its
dissolved mineral content

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as the electromagnetic
properties that

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
flow through the
location and its geology,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.757 align:middle line:84%
making for a very
potent combination.

00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Out of the thousands
of case histories

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
of peoples' interaction
with sacred sites, perhaps

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
my favorite is the story of
Englishman John [? Trilyle, ?]

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:90%
born in 1640 with twisted limbs.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
For the first 16
years of his life,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
he was partially paralyzed.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:10%
But after experiencing
a prophetic dream,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:10%
he was instructed to crawl
around the particular holy-well

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:10%
three times, then
bathe in its waters,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:10%
and sleep above the
underground stream.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
In the following days,
he regained strength

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and was completely cured of the
knotted sinews of his limbs.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, John went on to
enlist in the King's army,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.215 align:middle line:84%
where he served
gallantly for many years.

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:84%
When you enter a temple, what
you're actually walking into

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
is an invisible world
of harmonics, resonance,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:90%
and subtle energies.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
When combined, these elements
affect the human body

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to an extraordinary degree,
because both the human temple

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and the constructed temple
are built upon the same laws.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And that is the laws of nature.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the human
body, it's actually not

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:90%
very physical at all.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a series of
atoms and molecules

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
spiraling at enormous
speed, giving the illusion

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:90%
of solid appearance.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But squeeze all the air out,
and what you'd be left with

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:90%
would fit in a teaspoon.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Then there's DNA, the
essence of who we are.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:10%
At its core, it's chemical
bonds are constructed

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:10%
from two geometric shapes--

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:10%
the hexagram and the pentagram.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:10%
Expressed numerically, that's
a ratio of six to five.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
This ratio is also
inherent in the temple

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:90%
we come from-- the Earth.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The reason why life exists
here and in no other part

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of the solar system is due
to the unusual rotation

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:10%
The pole completes a full
cycle every 25,920 years.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:10%
While this is taking
place, the Earth's axis

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:10%
tilts four degrees over
the course of 21,000 years.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:10%
The ratio between the two
is, again, six to five.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the Earth is mirrored
inside the human body.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
This correspondence establishes
a direct relationship

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
between the two
and probably lies

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of why we are
drawn to geometric forms.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Such harmonic resonance defines
everything around us, even

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:90%
in the sub-atomic world.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It is the underlying
language of nature--

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.124 align:middle line:90%
the very essence of life.

00:06:43.124 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's particularly
obvious when

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
it manifests in the simplest
single-celled organisms called

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:90%
diatoms.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
This resonance is also
the foundation of sound,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
for when sound is made
visible and photographed,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
it displays the very same
harmonic forms, proving

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
that vibration is an essential
component in the process

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
These scientific
observations are actually

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
fundamental beliefs in
every ancient culture.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And they incorporated these
concepts in their sacred art.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:10%
To them, actions taking
place in the physical

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:10%
follow the rules of principles
of harmonic resonance

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:10%
taking place in the nonphysical.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The temple builders applied
these rules in a practical way.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Because sacred
geometry epitomizes

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:90%
the perfection of nature--

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
what they call the
domain of the gods--

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
ancient architects encoded
these harmonics invisibly

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
in the blueprint of temples.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It is disguised in the way the
elements relates to each other.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
The temples feel right,
because their proportions

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:90%
are based on natural laws.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the reason
why sacred places affect

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
our senses.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Their harmonics interacts
with our subconscious.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
They remind us of
this perfection

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that we strive for in our lives.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Because every geometric form is
an expression of an underlying

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, each shape
was observed in nature

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and deliberately chosen
to generate an environment

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
for each temple that
induces a desired effect.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
One excellent example
is Stonehenge.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:84%
As far as the average
troglodyte is concerned,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge is a
jumble of large rocks.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But underneath its skin,
every form of sacred geometry

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
lies concealed, each shape
defining the placement

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:90%
of its arcs and circles.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
The builders of
sacred space also

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
understood that intent
is an energy in itself--

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
a view now accepted throughout
the enlightened scientific

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So any group of people
enter Stonehenge

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
with the intent to
work with, say, healing

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and the application
of the lifeforce--

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that intent triggers the
only parts of Stonehenge that

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:90%
are defined by the pentagram.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
When another group works with
sounds, on the other hand,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they will invoke the
geometry associated

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
with sound, the seven-sided
heptagram, and thus,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:90%
the entire original site.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
The same idea was employed
in Gothic cathedrals

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
by people following
the exact same recipe.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And it is not by
accident that visitors

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
to places like Chartres
are significantly

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
moved inside these buildings
above any other design

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:90%
of the period.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The effect has little to
do with religious belief

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and more to do with the
interaction between the body

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:90%
and the resonant environment.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
To prove this, experiments
by scientists in Bulgaria

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
found the building hospital
room shaped like pentagrams

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:90%
improved the rate of health.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Rooms shaped like trapezoids
improved schizophrenia.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And spherical shapes improved
the coagulation of blood.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors also understood
that the energy of an object

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
does not stop at its
physical boundary--

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that all forms possess
a radiant energy field.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:10%
We call this field
by different names--

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:10%
aura, resonance, radiance,
morphic field, chi.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, it is a field that
exists around an organism where

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%
information is stored.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.595 align:middle line:84%
You could call it the organism's
business card or soul.

00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
When the energy of two organisms
intersects and their resonance

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
is sympathetic with
one another, a bond

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
takes place and information is
transferred between the two.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
We know this process by
another common name, love.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Since ancient times,
people were known

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to have the innate
capacity to fully

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
engage with this invisible
universe, with a source--

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
hence the term sorcerer.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that some
point over the course of time

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, things go
very, very wrong.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Ego takes over.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
You begin to associate
with the material world

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
to a point where you become
disconnected from the source.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
In such a state,
the orderly geometry

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of your atoms and molecules
becomes disorderly.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:90%
You enter a state of duality--

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
a separation between
physical and spiritual.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
To put it simply,
you are no longer at

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:90%
ease with your environment.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you have
become diseased.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:84%
To remedy the problem,
the temple builders

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
created environments
to remind people

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
of their state of
perfection and bring them

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
into a state of balance.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a phrase written
inside certain temples

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
states that the temple
is there to, quote,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
"transform the person into
a god, into a bright star."

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
temple was built

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to alter that which has become
imperfect into something

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:90%
perfect.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
At the Temple of Edfu, they
even made a joke about it.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And it reads, "We will
keep building temples

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
until people recognize
the temple in themselves."

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Let us now look at what makes
temples energetically active

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and why they were looked
upon as living beings.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
First, all sacred
sites without exception

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
are located on
magnetic hot-spots.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Decades of research
in Britain reveals

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
how hundreds of its
main ancient sites

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
are sited along the path
of two of the earth's

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
major electromagnetic pathways.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Another major study-- this
time in northern France--

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
was conducted by an electrical
engineer named Pierre

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:84%
[? Moreaux. ?] Interestingly,
he was skeptical

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that ancient megaliths
held any special powers--

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that such things were figments
of the new-age imagination.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Moreaux concluded his
painstaking scientific work

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
by submitting that
the sites are alive.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The structures such
as dolmens behave

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:84%
like resonators, menhirs
like coils, and stone circles

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:90%
like batteries.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, the
supposedly dead lumps of stone

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
actually received stored and
emitted electrical pulses

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:90%
at regular intervals.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
He essentially validated all the
world myths describing standing

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:90%
stones as living entities--

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
as sensitive beings who are
congenial and yet like us,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
are easily offended.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:10%
We can now understand why people
use the very same sacred sites

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:10%
to heal all manner of ailments,
even to facilitate childbirth

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:10%
for thousands of years.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:10%
Until recently,
fertility dances were

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:10%
performed in northern
Europe, in which women

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:10%
would slide the stones
between their legs

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:10%
to improve conception.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I
undertook an experiment

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to monitor the energy field
of a sacred mound in England.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
This animation shows
the mound from above

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and the ripples of energy
measured every two weeks

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.796 align:middle line:90%
over the course of one year.

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Red is positive, or
masculine polarity.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Blue is negative,
or female polarity.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Showed in sequence,
these ripples

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:84%
move as though the site
is breathing in and out.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But what amazed me most was
the spatial relationship

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:90%
between the ripples.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Each space is defined by the
very sacred geometry that

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:84%
defines the orbits of
planets and organic life

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.175 align:middle line:90%
forms on Earth.

00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So this humble, sacred site
emits electromagnetic pulses

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:84%
that shift according
to seasons--

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to solar and lunar impulses,
even the Earth's rotating core.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:10%
Bear in mind that a small change
in the local electromagnetic

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:10%
field is all it takes
to alter information

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:10%
received by human DNA.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Mounds, pyramids, and
underground chambers

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
were designed to shield
certain frequencies

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and generate an artificial
energetic environment within.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:84%
At Delphi and the Great Pyramid,
for example, the base resonance

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
is 7.8 Hertz,
which happens to be

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
the brainwave frequency
of healers and psychics

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:90%
when they are working.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you interact
with sacred places,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:84%
these specially
designed environments

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
behave like living organisms
whose resonance alters

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:84%
the information
received by your DNA.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, they act on the
imperfections inside the body,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
reshaping them,
enabling a person

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to achieve optimum health
mentally, spiritually,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.037 align:middle line:84%
and under the right
circumstances, physically.

00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
There is one more element
that creates a healing

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:90%
environment in sacred places.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's one we
take for granted.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And that is water.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
All sacred sites are
placed above or adjacent

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to springs, underground
streams, holy wells, aquifers,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and other bodies of water.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.971 align:middle line:84%
Water is a fundamental
element in every temple.

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The relationship between water,
electromagnetism, healing,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and sacred sites has
been known for centuries.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:10%
In Celtic times, holy people
founded oracles and churches

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:10%
at locations where they observe
animals choosing a certain spot

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:10%
on the land to give birth.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
The same observation
has been made

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
by douses, who saw how
sick animals are attracted

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
to hot spots where water
and electromagnetism combine

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
and generate an
invisible vortex.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Animals would not
behave like this

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
unless there is a direct
benefit to their well-being.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
The English douse
Guy Underwood made

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of careful
studies of ancient sites

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:90%
and Gothic cathedrals.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:10%
And his drawings prove
the direct relationship

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:10%
between the size and
placement of the structures

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:10%
to invisible paths of energy.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Science has also shown
that water at holy places

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
possesses greater
properties of resonance.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
It can absorb a greater
frequency spectrum of light.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And when observed
under the microscope,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
holy water shows hundreds
of spinning vortices,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.935 align:middle line:84%
as though this water
is truly alive.

00:17:54.935 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
The curative properties
of this living water

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
were known to doctors
in cities like London,

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
even in the 19th century,
because they regularly

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
sent their patients 200 miles
by train to sacred springs

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
to be cured of tumors or eye
problems and other afflictions

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:90%
they could not cure.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:10%
When you build a temple
over a spring or flowing

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:10%
underground water,
the site attracts

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic pathways,
as shown in this image made

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:10%
by a magnetometer.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:10%
The resonant environment
inside the stone circle

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:10%
behaves like a vortex.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And this sets up a
unique correspondence

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
with the human body, because
the body is electromagnetic.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And it is composed of
2/3 water, part of which

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
is in the blood, which
itself requires a vorticular

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
motion to move it through the
body's arteries and veins.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
It demonstrates, once again, how
the temple and the human body

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:90%
are mirrors of each other.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, when water spins,
it does two curious things.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
First, when it
flows down a hole,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:84%
it takes on an angle
of 19.47 degrees, which

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.190 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the angle at
which energy is released

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:90%
from the core of the earth.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
This concept was not lost
on temple builders, who

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
applied this angle
to reference temples

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:90%
to each other on the landscape.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, when it
spins, water generates

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
its own electromagnetic
field, enabling water

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to record information.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it makes
water have a memory.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is,
this was already

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:90%
known to Egyptians in 8,000 BC.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian god
of wisdom Djhuty

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:10%
wrote, this is the
property of our medicine

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:54.610 align:middle line:10%
into which the previous body
of the spirits are reduced.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:10%
That at first, one part
there of shall tinge

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:10%
10 parts of this perfect body.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:10%
Then 100.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:10%
And then 1,000.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:10%
And so on, infinitely on.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:10%
And by how much more
often the medicine

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:10%
is dissolved, by so much
more is increased in virtue.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, of course, we call
this process homeopathy.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You take four drops
of a solution,

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
dilute it a million
times, and spin it.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And the water retains the
memory of the original solution.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:10%
The idea that a highly
diluted solution

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:10%
can retain the essence
of its original

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:10%
was proved 40 years ago
by Jacques Benveniste,

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:10%
whose experiments
were replicated

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:10%
in no less than five independent
laboratories in Europe.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
That water is capable
of remembering

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:84%
the resonance of living
energy was further developed

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
by Edward Bach, whose plant
tinctures still carry his name

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and provide healing to
millions around the world.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But water can also be shaped
by the energy field of a human

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:84%
being-- specifically,
it's focused intent.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the human
body is 2/3 water.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
You add it's electromagnetic
field plus intention,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and you have a very,
very powerful tool.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
This was the idea proposed
by Japanese scientist Masuro

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Emoto, whose controlled
experiments clearly show

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
the influence of human intent.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, he shows the
crystalline structure

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
of ordinary water
and the same water

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:84%
after it comes into contact
with a photograph capturing

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
the moment a young child
imagines a positive thought.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
In another notable
experiment, the same water

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
was placed in two vials
and given to two people.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
One was asked to write the
words love, appreciation

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
with focused intent
on the label.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
The other wrote,
you make me sick.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I will kill you.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
The results speak
for themselves.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It demonstrates the
power of focused intent

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and the capacity of resonance
to exchange information

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
between two organisms,
to the point where

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
another organism can
be drastically altered

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
and improved.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Our story now takes
a dramatic turn.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:84%
For many years, I've
wondered, what if a person

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:90%
lives too far from a temple?

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Can the resonant
energy of a sacred site

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:90%
be tapped at a distance?

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And how I came about this
method will surprise you.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It just requires an open mind.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
In my first book,
"Secrets in the Fields,"

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I outline the science
and evidence proving

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that the genuine crop
circles appearing

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
across the face of the
earth in past decades

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:84%
incorporate identical
principles used in temples.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
They even contain
information, part of which

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
is a code that is capable
of being transferred

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:90%
to living organisms.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I went out
so far as to state

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that these mysterious
symbols are the new temples.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:10%
They certainly incorporate
identical encoded geometric

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.975 align:middle line:10%
harmonics common
to ancient temples.

00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:10%
They reference each
other as well as temples

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:10%
on the landscape using
that 19.47 degree

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:10%
common to water and the earth.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The visual aspect
of crop circles

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.355 align:middle line:84%
follows the same
harmonic laws of sound.

00:23:36.355 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And like sacred
places, they contain

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
a measurable
electromagnetic field

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.554 align:middle line:84%
that differs significantly
on the outside than inside.

00:23:49.554 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:10%
And when this resonant
field interacts with seeds,

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:10%
it has been proven to
increase vitality in plants,

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:10%
invigorating seed growth
by as much as two to one

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:10%
compared to ordinary seeds.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:10%
And the crop circles
are also manifesting

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:10%
using the same vortex
motion of energy found

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:10%
in nature and sacred sites.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And just like
sacred sites, water

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is fundamental to crop circles.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
They are always found
besides sources of water

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:90%
or above aquifers.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
This infrared image
shows the crop circle,

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:84%
how it has displaced millions
of gallons of groundwater.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
In blind tests,
it was discovered

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that the water from inside
non-man-made crop circles

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
was potentized up to a
136% above control samples.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
If so, what could this
be doing to people

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:90%
who visit these modern temples?

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these elements--
electromagnetism, water,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:90%
and spin--

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
are common to the human body.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Experiments monitoring
people's brain waves

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.160 align:middle line:84%
inside crop circles
using EEG devices

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
show measurable increase
in right brain activity

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:90%
compared to normal environments.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.661 align:middle line:84%
The same effect also takes
place inside Gothic cathedrals.

00:25:09.661 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the most
startling evidence

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
pointing to an interaction
with the human biological field

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
is how they contain
a signature frequency

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
range of 260 to 320 megahertz.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
In the early 70s,
the body was found

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to be composed of a
range of frequencies,

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
much like a radio
stations along the dial.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But there was a noticeable range
where there exists no stations.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And that range is
260 to 320 Hertz.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So it seems though
crop circles are

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
filling in the missing
frequencies of the human body

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and upping the
frequency tenfold.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It suggests there is a
definitive interaction taking

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
place between the two
organisms, even more so

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
when you consider that
one particular crop circle

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
references the points
in the DNA molecule

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:90%
that are not coded for protein.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Since both the human
body and crop circles

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:84%
are electromagnetic
organisms, the implications

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:90%
are extraordinary.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Consider, for
example, that changes

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:84%
in the local
bio-electromagnetic field

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:90%
can be transmitted to DNA.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And in laboratory
experiments in China,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
it has already been shown
that genetic information can

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
be successfully transmitted
from one organism to the other

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:90%
using this technique.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, crop circles
are living organisms.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:10%
Just like temples
and trees, they

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:10%
possess a measurable energy
field that expresses itself

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:10%
in several forms--

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:10%
radial and concentric,
like ripples in a pond.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:10%
The latter is identical to the
energy fields shown earlier--

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:10%
that morphic field where an
organism's information is

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:10%
stored.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And this information is also
expressed with geometry--

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:90%
the language of living nature.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Remember how human
DNA is also geometric?

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And how when two sympathetic
geometries interact,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:84%
an exchange of information
takes place between organisms?

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Now we begin to see how crop
circles could share information

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:84%
with people who
interact with them

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.995 align:middle line:84%
and why we react to crop circles
with such a strong emotions.

00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Since crop circles
manifest along

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the same paths of
magnetic energy

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
as nearby sacred
sites, many of which

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
already come with a rich
tradition of healing,

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
it's quite possible
that crop circles

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:90%
carry the same potential.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, there are
hundreds of case histories

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:90%
demonstrating this.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In one case, shortly
before an osteopath

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.460 align:middle line:84%
presented the lecture, he
walked through the audience

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and handed out
copies of this image,

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
without saying anything
about it or what

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:90%
he was about to discuss.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
By the time he returned
to the front of the room,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:84%
a woman in the audience
held up her hand

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and said to him that she had
suffered from acute arthritis

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But after looking at the
image of this crop circle,

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
the pain in her joints suddenly
and permanently went away,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
to which he replied, welcome
to an evening of crop

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:90%
circles and healing.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Another situation involved
an 82-year-old woman

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
called Margaret, who too had
suffered pain in her joints

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
for 15 years, to the point
where she required assistance

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:90%
to lie down and get up.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:84%
One day, her regular
helpers took her

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
for a picnic inside
a crop circle that

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:90%
had appeared near her home.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Margaret was very
skeptical of these things,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
believing them to be
clever pranks by people.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.917 align:middle line:90%
But she went anyway.

00:28:54.917 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:84%
As they were about to
sit down in the field,

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
the two helpers moved
forward to assist Margaret.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But she brushed them
away, saying she

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do this by herself.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They watched her sit
and lie down, unassisted

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in over
a decade, and then rise

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to her feet, all from
being inside a crop circle.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.247 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.247 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Then there was the
hay fever sufferer,

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.590 align:middle line:84%
who walked a mile out into
a canola field, to which she

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
was allergic, but
visited a crop circle,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and ever since has been
cured of her condition.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the more dramatic
cases involves a young man

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
in America named Ethan,
who was diagnosed

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:90%
with a 99% malignant eye tumor.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:84%
He was put on a
strict medication,

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:90%
which he declined to take.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.605 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, his mother
has visited a crop circle

00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
in England and in a
clairvoyant moment

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
was told to take some
of its seeds home

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and give them to her son.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Ethan did exactly
that for several weeks

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
as well as visualizing
the same crop circle.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
When he returned
to the hospital,

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:84%
doctors were astonished to
find the tumor had gone.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they asked Ethan how
he was able to cure himself,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.518 align:middle line:84%
well, the reaction
was priceless.

00:30:06.518 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:90%


00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share
one more story.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.270 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine named
Abby called me one day

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to tell me how she wanted
to help her neighbor, a dear

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:84%
friend who had
just been sent home

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:84%
from hospital to spend her last
hours in peace with family.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
She had been diagnosed
with terminal bone cancer

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and was given 72 hours to live.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Abby asked me how she
could use the crop

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:90%
circles to heal her friend.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.550 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I had to
basically stop her and say,

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:90%
crop circles do not heal.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But they do carry codes
that have the capacity

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to influence another
organism, particularly where

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.730 align:middle line:84%
there exists a sympathetic
resonance between the two.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the organism--
or person in this case--

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:90%
needs to want to heal.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to belief, healing
in its wider context

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:90%
also includes death.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.775 align:middle line:84%
Because for some
things, dying may

00:31:04.775 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:90%
be the best form of healing.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
As bystanders, we cannot know
or judge someone else's ultimate

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.880 align:middle line:90%
intended purpose in life.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Only they know what is best for
them, consciously or otherwise.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, Abby
wanted to try it.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
After all, what
was there to lose?

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So I instructed her
to let her friend look

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:84%
through the images in
my book and see if there

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
was one she reacted to.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:90%
She did, and very strongly.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I instructed Abby
to take the photograph,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
place a vial of spring
water on the image.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And the next step
was very important,

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:84%
because she had to act
as the conduit, whereby

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the image was
visualized being transferred

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:90%
into the water.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:90%
She's like an intermediary.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And then she created
the tincture.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.610 align:middle line:84%
She was to give four drops four
times a day to her neighbor,

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
much like the Bach
flower remedies.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
As much as Abby wanted her
friend to just get up and walk,

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I had to remind her again
not to put any judgement

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.534 align:middle line:90%
or expectation on the outcome.

00:32:10.534 --> 00:32:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this illness
was something

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:90%
she needed to experience.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps dying was
her way of healing.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Two weeks went by.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Abby's neighbor, who for
all intents and purposes,

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
ought to have been
dead and buried,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:84%
drove herself to a
hospital and continued

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:33.530 align:middle line:84%
to live a reasonably healthy
life for several more months.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful and true story.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:90%
But there's a sad ending.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The woman stopped taking
the remedy, lapsed

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:84%
into a state of disease,
and eventually passed away.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:84%
When I met Abby and
discussed this experience,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:84%
she informed me
that her neighbor

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:90%
was a fundamental Christian.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that a seemingly
alien artifact cured her

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:90%
frightened her.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.580 align:middle line:84%
As far as her belief
was concerned,

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
this was nothing
more than witchcraft.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, her
belief prevented

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.175 align:middle line:90%
her accepting this magic.

00:33:07.175 --> 00:33:10.300 align:middle line:84%
This energy short
circuited the connection.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the
crop circle was

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:84%
no longer able to find its
sympathetic counterpart.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And contact stopped.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:84%
The experience taught
me a useful lesson.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It proved that crop circles,
just like ancient temples,

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.470 align:middle line:90%
are not miracle cures.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:84%
They do, however,
contain a potential.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And we are part of the process.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.485 align:middle line:84%
We have to meet this
potential halfway.

00:33:34.485 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Oldest was beginning to
answer my original question

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:84%
about bringing the energy
of the temple to you.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The problem with using a
photograph in this digital era

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.660 align:middle line:84%
is you cannot be certain if
the original image has been

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:90%
distorted.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if it has, then
the energy is not retained.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So I had to find a more reliable
method of treating organisms

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:84%
at a distance by tapping
a subtle energy code.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:90%
And this method does exist.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It's called resonance therapy.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:90%
It's also known as radionics.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Radionics works on the principle
that every living organism

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded by a
morphic field containing

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
a code, which enables
the organism to resonate

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:90%
with its environment.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:10%
The scientist who made this
discovery was Albert Abrams.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:10%
While studying nature and the
resonance of living organisms

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:10%
at Stanford University,
he'd reached the conclusion

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:10%
that all disease is
based on vibration.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.040 align:middle line:84%
In 1924, the British
parliament investigated

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
his outlandish claims
and upheld them,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
maintaining that his method
of transmitting a healing

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
code to another organism across
space and time does work.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Abrams method was taken a stage
further by Malcolm Ray, who

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
developed a system using
a series of simulator

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:84%
cards, where the magnetic,
geometric representations

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of remedies are stored in
the form of concentric rings

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.120 align:middle line:90%
and radii.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
These cards were then fed into a
device and the code transmitted

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
to a receiving
substance, such as water.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It was here that I
made the connection.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Where had I seen
these patches before?

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:84%
In the concentric ring
and radial energy patterns

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:90%
of crop circles, of course.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It occurred to me that if there
exists a link between the two,

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
then the crop circles
also contain a resonance

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.660 align:middle line:90%
and potentially healing code.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
This is where I
came across the work

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Institute of
Resonance Therapy in Germany.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:84%
IRT specializes in revitalizing
ecosystems in distress

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as people with
all manner of ailments.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Their method is to take a
map of the area to be treated

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:84%
or a photograph of a person and
then supply the missing code

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to the ecosystem in distress.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:84%
They found this code hardwired
in a variety of forms--

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:84%
radionics cards,
mandalas, letters

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.800 align:middle line:84%
from ancient alphabets
such as Sanskrit,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
even the symbolic
language of runes.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, IRT locates
the organism's hard drive,

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:84%
supplies the
appropriate software,

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and enables the organism
to reboot and heal itself.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Evidence that a sympathetic
resonant code also

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
exists in crop
circles was discovered

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:46.640 align:middle line:84%
when IRT used these images to
revitalize a park in Austria.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:90%
The problem was this.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:84%
The local counsel had
invested a good amount

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:84%
of time, money, and energy
into landscaping this park.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Yet few people felt
comfortable there.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:84%
At the request of the
local authorities,

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
IRT quietly transmitted the
code from a crop circle image

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.800 align:middle line:84%
from their office in
Germany to this park.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.960 align:middle line:84%
After two years of
remote work, the park

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:84%
became a focal point
for community life,

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:84%
as though some discard
energy had been cleared.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.930 align:middle line:84%
In researching the
history of the park,

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.030 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that
a major atrocity

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:84%
had been committed there
during the Second World War.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And the trauma of
the event had been

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
memorized by the water
trapped beneath the park

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.960 align:middle line:90%
and trapped ever since.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Later, IRT worked on
revitalizing dying forests

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:90%
in the Czech Republic.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.700 align:middle line:84%
After three years of ongoing
treatment at a distance

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.600 align:middle line:84%
using crop circle images,
the vitality of trees

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
was as much as 65% above
trees of similar species

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:90%
throughout the country.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
As a bonus, the first
wave of crop circles

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.150 align:middle line:84%
appeared in the Czech
Republic as a kind

00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:00.190 align:middle line:84%
of validation of the work
undertaken by the company.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Soon more evidence
began to appear

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.680 align:middle line:84%
in support of the vibratory
power of crop circles.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:10%
In one independent experiment,
the crystalline structure

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:10%
of tap water was
photographed before and after

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.340 align:middle line:10%
it came into contact with
a photo of a crop circle.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:10%
The result, again,
speaks for itself.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It seems the crop circle
images behave like mandalas.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So the next logical
step was to see

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.420 align:middle line:84%
whether they retained the
energy field when simplified

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:90%
into accurate diagrams.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Inspired by the Malcolm
Ray simulator card system,

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I developed a series of
crop circle resonance cards,

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
where these remedies,
so to speak,

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
are stored in their
perfect vibratory states.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
More to the point, they
achieved my original idea

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.900 align:middle line:84%
of being able to bring
the temple to you,

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.766 align:middle line:84%
so you can access this
tool anytime, anywhere.

00:38:51.766 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:84%
A number of kinesiologists were
enlisted for initial trials.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I gave them no instruction,
except to play the cards

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:90%
as they saw fit.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.870 align:middle line:90%
The results were dramatic.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
In every case, patients' energy
fields reacted positively

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.560 align:middle line:84%
whenever the cards were used in
applied kinesiology, or muscle

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.820 align:middle line:90%
testing.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.950 align:middle line:84%
In one case, despite
the practitioner

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.980 align:middle line:84%
having a wide range of
remedies at her disposal,

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:84%
the only positive response was
when she used a crop circle

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.670 align:middle line:90%
card during the process.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.095 align:middle line:84%
That card was then used to
create a homeopathic tincture

00:39:35.095 --> 00:39:36.095 align:middle line:90%
that healed the patient.

00:39:36.095 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's true.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Crop circles in diagrammatic
form retain their information

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and can be accessed by
any organism in distress.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I place no limitations
on their potential.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I am constantly amazed
by the unusual ways people

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.250 align:middle line:90%
apply them.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:84%
One massage therapist
tunes into the cards

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:84%
prior to her client's arrival
and asks for the correct card

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to make itself known for the
highest good of that client.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.710 align:middle line:84%
She then uses it to stimulate
the energy field of the room

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:middle line:90%
during a session.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I personally know her approach
works, because she tried it

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:90%
on me without my knowledge.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And for over an
hour, while lying

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:84%
flat on her table, while
I saw in my mind's eye

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
was the image of
this very crop circle

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:84%
she had picked out
earlier, but only showed me

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.060 align:middle line:90%
after the session was over.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a nurse who
works in a hospital, where

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.340 align:middle line:84%
she is responsible
for assisting patients

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:90%
before and after surgery.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.420 align:middle line:84%
She asked each patient
to pick a card--

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:90%
any card.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:84%
She said that they would pick
one symbol that made them smile

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and place the card on
their belly button--

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:84%
the solar plexus--
and watch these people

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.330 align:middle line:84%
losing the fear of going
into the operating theater.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:84%
When they returned,
still under anesthesia,

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:84%
she would replace the
card on the solar plexus.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:84%
One day, she said, a team of
doctors marched into the room,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:84%
demanding to know why
the patients in her care

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:84%
required fewer days of
recovery after operations.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it was affecting
the hospital's bottom line.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, I
place a crop circle card

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.040 align:middle line:90%
on their belly button.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.645 align:middle line:84%
The doctors apparently
just walked out in silence

00:41:26.645 --> 00:41:27.445 align:middle line:90%
and never returned.

00:41:27.445 --> 00:41:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I once saw an
attendee at my lecture

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
walk over to a set of
cards sitting on a table.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't mentioned
anything about them.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were going to be
the subject of the following

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:90%
day's presentation.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I had not anticipated
the gentleman to return,

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:84%
because he seemed very
skeptical of my work.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he seemed
intrigued by these symbols,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and then he left.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The following day, he was
sitting at the front row.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I expressed my surprise
at seeing him again,

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
whereupon he said, I've
been smoking for 10 years.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
these cards were.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:90%
I just put my hand over them.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And for the past 12
hours, I have not

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.222 align:middle line:84%
picked up a single cigarette,
nor do I feel the desire to.

00:42:14.222 --> 00:42:15.430 align:middle line:90%
What is it with these things?

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:84%
These examples are not figments
of people's imaginations.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Because a blind
test was conducted

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:84%
on the cards using
a device developed

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
by Konstantin Korotkov,
a physicist and president

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.460 align:middle line:84%
of the International Union
of Medical and Applied

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Bioelectrography.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.530 align:middle line:10%
The results show how
the bio-electric energy

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:10%
field of an activated
card is noticeably

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.500 align:middle line:10%
different to the card
that is no more than ink

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:10%
on a piece of cardboard.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:84%
It proves that the cards
retain the information coded

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:90%
in the original crop circle.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.650 align:middle line:84%
With a manifesting
of crop circles,

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:84%
we are witnessing an
extraordinary potential

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:84%
being encoded into the
earth, as these new temples,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:84%
like their ancient predecessors,
invite us to rediscover

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:84%
a universal system of
knowledge that helped bring

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.420 align:middle line:84%
diseased biological
systems back into harmony

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.450 align:middle line:90%
with their environment.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
We stopped building sacred
places after the 13th century.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.180 align:middle line:84%
We have forgotten that
energy hot-spots exist

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:84%
around the earth that helped
re-establish a bond between us

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and the natural world.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.490 align:middle line:10%
And as our ancestors
correctly predicted,

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.910 align:middle line:10%
denying this
connection would result

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:10%
in the imbalance
of the individual,

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.280 align:middle line:10%
an unhealthy society,
and ultimately,

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:10%
the downfall of entire cultures.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the crop circles
by their design and behavior

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.300 align:middle line:84%
are filling this
gap, reminding us

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of a legacy that is waiting
to be interacted with.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.820 align:middle line:84%
We already know these
temples can code water.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So why not the potential
to heal people?

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.860 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, it was
discovered that when

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:84%
DNA is altered, as in
the case of cancer,

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:84%
a single atom of
ruthenium placed

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.620 align:middle line:84%
at each end of a
short strand of DNA

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.860 align:middle line:84%
makes ruthenium resonates
with a diseased cell,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:84%
causing the deformed
DNA to be corrected.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Within hours of this
discovery, this crop circle

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.430 align:middle line:84%
appeared, featuring
a short strand of DNA

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
with a large atom at each
end, as though validating

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.400 align:middle line:90%
this scientific breakthrough.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Could these new temples
also be encoding ideas

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
into our biosphere?

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.600 align:middle line:90%
One thing is certain.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Like temples, stone
circles, and sacred places,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:51.430 align:middle line:84%
these symbols require a bridge
that springs them into action.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And by demonstrating that
our intent is that bridge,

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:84%
ultimately we are
the co-creators

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.980 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual technology.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:84%
As the Hopi say, we are
the ones we're waiting for.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And they're right, of course.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But because we are
only too human,

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:11.660 align:middle line:84%
we sometimes need a little
nudge from an intelligence

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.460 align:middle line:90%
beyond our world.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.610 align:middle line:90%
