00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll staple that hat to your
head if you can't keep it on.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It will be in proximity to me.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.026 align:middle line:90%
That means kind of close to me.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's from the Latin.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:90%
You take Latin, don't you?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER): My name
is Thomas Alta Roudebush,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:90%
but many people call me Sir.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.254 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, my name is Roudy
but that's R-O-U-D-Y.

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of the last
cowboy around Telluride.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.526 align:middle line:90%
The others just pass through.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:90%
That's good, girls.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Easy, now.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Come on, cows.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.596 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.295 align:middle line:84%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER): You get
a horse that trusts you,

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and, uh, you have
a wonderful thing.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.335 align:middle line:84%
A lifelong relationship
that isn't gonna let you

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:90%
down, and go away some time.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
These mountains
are an inspiration

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to me on a daily basis.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
You feel deep roots when
you live on the Continental

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Divide for 30 years.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the backbone of the
world, and maybe it makes

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.877 align:middle line:90%
me stronger just looking at it.

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey, hey.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER): As I get
older I have more questions,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
but I don't care so
much about the answers.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
It's more the matter of the
pondering is what I enjoy.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
These are wild
animals, these elk,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's taken me 16 years
to get them to trust me--

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
not much, but enough
that I can ride

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.002 align:middle line:84%
up to them on horses, which
they're not as fearful of.

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all right, girls.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just me.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:84%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER):
Whenever I start

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
to scare 'em, I turn my side to
'em so I'm a prey animal too,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they-- then
they look at me and go,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, he's just that guy
that talks all the time.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing scary
about old Rowdy.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I want the horse calmed
down, not fired up.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing
is the opposite

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:90%
of what I asked you to do.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
What have I done
for Rowdy today,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
or better, what have I done for
Rowdy in the past few seconds?

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
All day long,
think that nonstop.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I came here in April
and asked Rowdy, uh,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:90%
did he need any help?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
His only one question was,
you don't cry easy, do ya?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Much as I hide
it, I really enjoy

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
harassing these young people
every day of their lives.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
He's good with the horses,
though, and he loves us all.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.375 align:middle line:84%
He's just not sure how
to say it all the time.

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.027 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.027 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:10%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER):
Basically, someone

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:10%
said, what's new in your
life, and I was able to say,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm sober.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:10%
So that's a new thing for me.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And interesting work, sobriety.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I certainly gave
alcohol every chance

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:90%
to be the right way to go.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.461 align:middle line:90%
Cindy, girl, there you go.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER): In
Wisconsin where I was raised,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
no one mentioned that if you
drank a case of beer every day

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.294 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years, it would
become addicting.

00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:90%
There's water in that.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.144 align:middle line:90%
I can still be a big tipper.

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm always telling her
that even though there's

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
no alcohol in these
glasses, I still want 'em.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:90%
A lot of 'em.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
As long as I can
exercise my arm.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be
in the bars forever.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to have a drink.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Coming in here to
see his old friends,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
whether he drinks or not--
it makes no difference.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably the
reason I quit the alcohol,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:90%
is to have more freedom.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
got-- a whole lot more

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:90%
freedom than I used to have.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
ROUDY (VOICEOVER): God,
I'd have less rules.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
We've experienced being free
and unfettered human beings here

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
because there aren't
many people and there

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:90%
isn't much government.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it's hard to
have your freedoms

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:90%
even infringed a little bit.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Cherish your freedom.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:34.067 align:middle line:90%
