00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd fallen off the
wall of normalcy,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and I had cracked into
a million tiny pieces.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was so scared
that I was going

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:84%
to spend the rest of
my life just broken.

>> We have people
with chronic pain.

We have people that are--
polypharmacy is what we call it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
in my profession, which means
they're on way too many meds.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And they take medication
for one thing,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and then that medication
causes a side effect.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the doctor
says, oh, here,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:90%
take this for that side effect.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%

was so much pain and so much

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
discomfort that even the very
smallest things like sitting up

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:84%
on the couch to just reach
forward and pick up a glass

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of water was something that I
had to sit for a solid minute

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and mentally work
myself up to doing,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the cost of just
reaching and grabbing that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
glass of water was going to
be pain that takes your breath

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:90%
away.

Man, when you're thrown
to the fire of you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
could lose your spouse of

Nobody can help me.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.825 align:middle line:90%

>> It's very difficult for these
patients to get the help they

need in the conventional medical
system because they come up

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:90%
against a lot of resistance.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
We have very savvy
patients nowadays.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They have access, like all
of us do, to a wide variety

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're very well educated.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they are trying to
be their own advocates,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
but they're oftentimes
met with resistance.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> When you see people
walking around in the street,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
you don't make
assumptions about people.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you do, but
you make assumptions

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
based on what you see,
not what's inside.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> This experience has led me to
become more connected to myself

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and to aspects of myself
that had been hibernating.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in some ways I feel
like that's why we're here,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
is to create and
to allow ourselves

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to heal through the
process of creation.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe when I'm
creating that my body knows

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing something new.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And it can learn
lessons from that.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.515 align:middle line:90%
It can heal again.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It can start things anew
and fresh every single day.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, an invisible illness
is anything that you could keep

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:90%
hidden if you wanted to.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you see somebody
walking or running,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
there's really no
way for us to know.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
are suffering in silence,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
or they're dealing
with things in silence.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
For me, that's invisible,
because we don't see it.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
themselves can't see it

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:90%
in their own bodies.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They know that something's off,
but they don't know what it is.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's also--

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that sort of fits the definition
for me of an invisible illness.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't have
a name, that doctors

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
can't diagnose, that
they can't treat,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that they can't give
you medicine for.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like the illness
itself is invisible because I

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
do look healthy, and
I do look capable.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to see
people one day where they're

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, you look great, I'm
so glad you're feeling better,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.345 align:middle line:84%
and have that same person
need something from you

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:90%
or ask something of you.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:90%
They're seeing you.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.783 align:middle line:90%
They're aware that you're there.

00:04:50.783 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
They're glad that you're
doing well and all of this,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have a real
understanding of how much that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:90%
might fluctuate day to day.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that realization,
almost more than anything,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:84%
it opened up this
well of compassion

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
for people, for all people, all
these people that I don't know,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to knowing myself, like what
was actually going on with me,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and to realize, how many
other people are out there

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
with these illnesses, with
these horrific things they're

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:84%
dealing with on an hourly
basis that I can't see?

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I think it
was the first time

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that I had just this
overwhelming compassion

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
for humanity and the
struggles that we are all

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.864 align:middle line:90%
going through all the time.

00:05:40.864 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> When you live with
an invisible illness,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
it's anything but
invisible to you.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And in your own life, it
changes and colors everything.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:90%
It can affect your sleep.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So that means you
could have insomnia,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or you could have like
I do-- night terrors,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and sleepwalking, and
sleep disturbances,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
which means that I'm
not getting good sleep.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Even if I go to bed
on time and even

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.072 align:middle line:84%
if I tried to do all of
the sleep hygiene things,

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I still am not getting sleep.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'm exhausted.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Even with the SIBO
that I deal with,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
the small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that leads to anemia
and iron deficiency,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
which, again, leads to chronic
fatigue and lack of energy.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So when I do get up and
I do have the energy

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to get something done
or go about my day,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
because of the digestive
issues that I have,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
because of the SIBO, I
have a very limited diet,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:84%
which means that I have
to cook all of my food.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And that takes energy and effort
throughout the day as well.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Her hands , for her.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Her hands were
outstretched in front.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the energy of the impact
came straight up into her body

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
from both the points of her
hands, as well as her knee.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Anytime we're hit and
our bodies are traveling

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.038 align:middle line:84%
at a certain speed,
and whatever hits us,

00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:05.705 align:middle line:84%
whether it's another
person or a vehicle

00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is traveling at a faster
speed, what we find

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
is that vibration
travels through us

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and creates trauma
at many levels.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's physical in the
muscles, in the organs.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when she lay down, I just
felt this sense of total shake

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
in her body.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I dealt with
invisible illness,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I would not have had any idea
how many areas of your life it

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
could affect, how significantly
it could impact your life

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
in the tiniest little
decisions to the largest ones,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
from the kind of car you have to
whether or not you wear makeup,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to the clothing and the
shoes that you wear,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to where you travel
or if you travel.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It even affects how
I can wear my hair

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and if I even get
to keep my hair.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I had hair that
was down to my waist.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I started dealing
with the digestive issues,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and with the SIBO, and
with the iron deficiency,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:90%
I started losing my hair.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
At some point, I had to
make the decision to cut off

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:90%
a significant amount.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>> She's a beautiful lady.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking
how traumatic it must have

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:90%
been to be hit by a vehicle.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I had seen people before
have been very bad accidents,

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
where their car
has been impacted.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But being physically hit
yourself is a whole 'nother

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Energetically and
emotionally, her body

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:90%
was not completely together.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like
the moment of the impact

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
separated her from
parts of herself.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Things change
from day to day.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.495 align:middle line:84%
And you can have a good
day, and make plans,

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and think that you're going
to be able to do all of them.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And then when the day
shows up you haven't slept,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
or I haven't slept
all night long.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to cancel
plans or change things.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's really hard because
it does feel like I'm a flake,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
or I'm lazy, or I just
don't want to show up.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's the complete
opposite of reality.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The reality is I want so much
to show up in my life, 100%,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be available.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want to have the
energy to live, and do,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and be all of the things
that I dream of doing.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reality of
invisible illness

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:90%
is that it's not my reality.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The pain has had a great
impact in my fitness career.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
My career as an instructor
was put on hold in some ways.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't progress as
much as the other instructors.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was because I was
always getting injured.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It looked like I
was always injured,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and I was always
taped constantly.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
They always put you in the
back room when that happens.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're
supposed to be healthy.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to be whole.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And you're not.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:90%
You're broken.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Many times I stayed in bed.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And you talk to people,
you email people,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
you chat with people
with the same problem.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And they listen to you, but
in the end you're by yourself.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't stand
up, and you get going,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.872 align:middle line:84%
and you go for
that walk, nobody's

00:10:27.872 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:90%
going to do it for you.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't open that door
for yourself, you're done for.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You need to get up,
brush that hair,

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:84%
put that makeup on,
put that scarf on.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Basically that's it.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's on you.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I have pain every day from
the moment I wake up until

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:90%
the moment I go to sleep.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
When I get up in the morning,
I can barely get out of bed.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And if I go out and
have a great day,

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I know by the time I get
home I can barely walk.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
effort and energy

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:90%
is being happy around people.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's hard, I think, to always
put on the face of, I'm great.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing good.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm having a good time.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Like that question, how are you?

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Everybody hates that question.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
If you have a chronic illness, I
don't want to burden the person

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:90%
with how I'm feeling.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like,
I'm doing great.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Or I think now I just
say, I'm all right,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
because it's a tough one.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, you
know they're asking

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and they truly want to
know, how are you feeling?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:90%
How bad is your pain today?

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you always
tell the truth,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm such
a Debbie Downer.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> People minimize trauma.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:84%
They think trauma has
to be in a combat zone.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Or I didn't think I
qualified to be in the chair

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
at Harborview Sexual Assault
and Traumatic Stress Counseling

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
for veterans of war

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and some woman that was gang
raped by five strangers.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I
qualified to sit in that seat

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:84%
because of all the multitude
of traumas I've had.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:90%
So I bless it all.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
blessing, even the stuff

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that's going on today.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It's temporary, so I bless it,
bless it, bless it, bless it,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.638 align:middle line:90%
because it's going to pass.

00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be different.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was single and
I didn't want to be single,

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:90%
I was like, bless it.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Fuck it, because I've
got the whole couch.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.488 align:middle line:90%
I can spread out.

00:12:53.488 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
There's room for me
and my dog, and I

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.155 align:middle line:90%
can let the dishes pile up.

00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not
accountable to anybody.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started
blessing that, boom,

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:90%
somebody put a ring on it.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing was
deciding to get involved with

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
her in the first place, which
was a pretty big decision

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking about
all hiking, and traveling,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and camping, and stuff like that
that I like to do on a cycle.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.196 align:middle line:90%
She keeps canceling our dates.

00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] How am I going to--

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:90%
is that really what I want?

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I asked her out a
few times, and she

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
kept canceling because she
wasn't able to make it.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:90%
She was sick.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
dating other people.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But I remember at one point
I just wrote a text to her,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and I said, you just draw me.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't stay away.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> When I park in
my handy parking,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I noticed that I was wincing.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to visibly
show the pain, because God

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
forbid should somebody
see me walking all fine.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But it is a deal
breaker when it's like,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%
do I walk 50 feet to the store?

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Sure, I can do that.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But can I walk back
with my groceries?

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
No, I can't, not
without hurting myself.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So the handy parking
is really helpful.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And I use it.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.488 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed-- it was
about a year or two ago,

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I noticed I was like, oh,
so nobody would look at me

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and think, she
scammed that card,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
or she doesn't qualify
somehow to be disabled.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:90%
I wanted bruises.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I wanted scars.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to lose my hair.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I wanted visible signs, visible
evidence that I was sick.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't want to have
to explain it every time.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:90%
It was exhausting.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Feel like I'm constantly
jumping from one thing

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:07.515 align:middle line:84%
to another thing to another
thing to try to heal myself

00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and none of it working.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:90%
My body's tired.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.235 align:middle line:90%
My heart is tired.

00:15:17.235 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So not specifically tired of
things, but more just tired.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not finding
answers that work.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Try so many different things
in so many different ways.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Then I get thinking
and judging myself--

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
should have stayed with that,
or should have done this,

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
should have taken that
medication longer,

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:90%
should have taken--

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.020 align:middle line:84%
not ate that lemon
bar, shouldn't have--

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and all the should've,
should've, should'ves, and then

00:15:52.270 --> 00:16:00.985 align:middle line:84%
judging myself and assuming
I would be healed by now.

00:16:00.985 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You will never ever catch
me saying cancer is a blessing

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.390 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
kind of bullshit.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, I don't
know that I would necessarily

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
trade that out
because I don't think

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that I would be anywhere
near who I am now,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:84%
just that the number of days
I even have left on the Earth

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:90%
is so finite.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I go after them with a
vigor that I would not

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
have had if I had carried
on in the oblivion of youth,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
where you're like, I'm alive,
and things are possible,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:90%
and I can do whatever I want.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this week, I had
this strange recognition

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that the number of sunrises
that I or any human

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
gets to see in their
lifetime is limited.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual
number to that,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%
and we can't know what it is.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
about that and thinking

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
where I am this summer, where
I am in my body right now

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
is the most physically capable
that I have been in years.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
needed to have a sunrise.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I needed to know that I had done
that right now, just in case

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't make it
past this month.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:84%
That thought, I guess,
it got me out of bed,

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
hiking up the closest
mountain here and up

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:84%
watching the sun actually
crest over the Cascade Range.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
things like that,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
that if I did not have the same
sense of the tentative nature

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
of life and just the
ebb and flow of what

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
our bodies on any given
day might actually

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
be capable of doing,
I think I probably

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
would have stayed in bed and
just gotten that extra three

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:90%
hours of sleep.

>> I think one of the hardest
things for a loved one,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:84%
particularly a spouse,
living with someone who has

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:84%
an invisible illness, is the
fact that you don't see it.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.967 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) Hush,
little darling.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:90%

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to buy
you a mockingbird.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't empathize with it.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see the
pain she was having.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
the concept of being

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:90%
in pain 24 hours a day.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.395 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
because of that, just

00:18:42.395 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
to be frank, I wasn't as
patient as I could have been,

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
as I should have been.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It was more than just the pain
that she was dealing with,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:90%
the physical pain.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
There was an emotional, deeper
pain that came from the fact

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that she couldn't
pick up her son.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the time of the
accident he was around six.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So he was still at the age
where she could pick him up.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is profoundly
impactful for a mother

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
not to have the ability
to hold her son again.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that is more
emotional for me around

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
invisible illness is the way
that I am able to show up

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
as a mom and the way that I
have missed things with my kids

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:90%
because of invisible illness.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:84%
More than my own
sacrifices, more

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
than my own losses,
the loss that I

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
feel for them in the time
that they get with me

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
or the energy I
have to participate

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:90%
is probably the hardest for me.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially for those two, who
have such an amazing closeness

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and such an incredible
relationship between mother

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:90%
and son.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are so
close and loving.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So it was a huge deal for her
not to be able to do that.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like you lose a part
of yourself as a mother.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Even beyond that, the
person that she saw herself

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:90%
as for so many years--

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:84%
she was a dancer,
and she was a runner,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and she was a
photographer, and did

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
all these things that were
very physical that she

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:90%
couldn't do anymore.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And when how you see yourself
has been profoundly changed

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
because of this accident
that you didn't have

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
any control over, it's more than
just the pain that affects you.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm confident that she'll
find more healing as she deals

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
with alternative forms of
medicine and alternative

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
forms of diet that can help
deal with her digestive issues

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:53.410 align:middle line:84%
or her blood sugar issues and
to lead a life that will be more

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
like the life that she
once had where she can

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
do the things that she wanted
to do and have a healthier body.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm blessed that I
still have my wife with me

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and that we can
grow old together.

it juice all the time--

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm sick, and oh--

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:90%
with my husband.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.490 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know I'm having a

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:90%
it's really bad today.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
you need to keep
people away from me,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and you might want to stay away
yourself because I'm just--

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I said it was
exhausting being with her--

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.412 align:middle line:90%
not being with her, but--

00:21:45.412 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
how I said it.

But what I was referring to
was not the day-to-day chores,

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
because that's no big deal.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I was
doing that anyway.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't mind doing that.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:90%
It's my privilege to do that.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm healthy.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I can do all that stuff.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I was referring
to how incredibly

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:90%
quickly our lives change.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we're
buying a houseboat.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
We were expecting to move
to a little apartment,

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and this houseboat was
plopped in our laps.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I would be
in this place for a while

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and then would keep on to
it for retirement income

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of stuff.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, now when
you're with Maleah,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:90%
you don't think that way.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what can be
sometimes exhausting, just

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
to keep up and allow such big
change to happen like this.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Our lives are
constantly changing.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I almost would say I'm
a different person--

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:84%
living in the
moment, appreciating

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:84%
every moment of life, and not
sweating the little stuff,

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
not thinking about the future
and the past, but gratitude.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Maleah is one of the most
grateful people I know--

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:90%
excuse me--

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
grateful people I know.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is a gift when you've

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:90%
been in bed for five years.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a gift.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely happier
than I've ever been.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And you find that when you
go out there in the world

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're happy, and you
express that happiness

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.205 align:middle line:84%
and joy to people, all of a
sudden things go way better.

want to be a burden.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think Kelly, more
than anyone I've ever known,

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:84%
has fought so hard for strength
that to show signs of weakness

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
has never been an option.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%

dress and undress every day

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:90%
because I couldn't do anything.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how many times he
or-- my various family members

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:84%
came up and helped
out for a while.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how many
times they told me

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were
happy to be helping

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and that they wanted
to be there helping,

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I had this fear inside
of me that at some point

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.661 align:middle line:84%
the amount of burden
that I was causing them,

00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:84%
it was finally going to
get to the snapping point,

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
going to be done with me

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and just going to be like, we
have given all of the love,

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and all of the assistance,
and all of the care

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have to give, and now
we need to go live our lives.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be a
burden, and I still don't.

there's that feeling that rises
just to under the surface.

And if I'm quick, I can
continue to speak about it.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I can bring it to the top
enough and look at it enough

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%

says, fuck you, not today,

on about her business--

kept Kelly alive.

There's no doubt that
they played their role.

Her illness is called

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And she and her twin sister
were diagnosed at the same time.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:84%
At times, I have felt a little
gagged around, how much am I--

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
how much is OK to
share about my mom?

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Because it's her primary story.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm a secondary person in
the story of her illness,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:84%
but yet I do have my own story
around it as her daughter.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And how do you explain that to
a kid, to one of my friends?

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like, can you
come do this with me?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Can you play, or can you meet
up and do this project with me?

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, I just have
responsibilities at home.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my mom
would say, blame it on me.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
You can just be
honest, blame it on me.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't--

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to blame
everything on her.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I guess
now as an adult

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:36.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting more
motivated to make myself

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.466 align:middle line:84%
a primary character
in this story

00:28:40.466 --> 00:28:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and share it from
my perspective,

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:84%
use my voice with it
because I have felt stifled

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:90%
around talking about it.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> People don't
even know, like--

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, you hung out with
your mom some other place

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:90%
than your living room?

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
For me personally, it's
been a solid five, six

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
years of just trying to
rebuild the relationship that

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
was pretty damaged
from her own problems

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:90%
and my problems as well.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So where I'm at now,
I work with kids.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to start
a little graduate

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:90%
program for counseling.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think it definitely
affected where I'm going now.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of her physical
problems is her back spine.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.867 align:middle line:84%
And a long time
ago, her leg hurt.

00:29:46.867 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's working now,
but she used to have

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:90%
to wear a pad to keep it.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we were traveling,
she needed a cane.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And she needed it everywhere.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And even in the airport
she needed a wheelchair

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:84%
because she can't walk that
much, because she can't walk up

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:84%
the steps, and
it's normally hard.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So she can just
call me for help,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and then I can help
her down the steps.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And I know when she needs it.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So I felt very helpful and
that I should enjoy the time

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I have with her.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.155 align:middle line:84%
>> How did that make you feel
when you saw her go through

00:30:21.155 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.418 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel sad, but I was so
happy that she was alive.

00:30:26.418 --> 00:30:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> If I had any advice for
someone navigating the current

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
health care system with a lot
of different symptoms that they

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.525 align:middle line:84%
have and they're just not really
sure what exactly they do have,

00:30:43.525 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:90%
be tenacious.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't give up.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Just keep going for
it, moving forward.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And if one person tells you
you're crazy, fuck them.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Just move on.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Being responsible for your
own health and your own care is

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
always a great thing.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine
going through life

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and not being in charge of my
own health, and my own care,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:90%
and my own world.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think for other
patients, I would always

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
recommend that they're
their own advocates,

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that they fight
for their answers.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before,
you listen to that gut.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.550 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
that intuition, it

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:84%
will lead you in a
different direction.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the only way
to work around this system,

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
it really is, to just fight
for what you know is right

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:90%
or if it's wrong.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Fight to find those answers.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Once I found out what
I had been diagnosed with,

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:90%
I scoured everything.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:90%
I went to every bookstore.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I bought every
book I could find.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I looked at everything
I could find.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And actually at that point,
it wasn't very accepted.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, my
doctor didn't accept it.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:90%
So I had to be my own advocate.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to go in
there, and I'd have

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:06.740 align:middle line:84%
to keep saying fibromyalgia, and
she would still not accept it.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:90%
And it went on.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.088 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally every time I
left the doctor I was in tears.

00:32:11.088 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So the best thing that we
can do is become our own patient

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
advocate because we know when
there's something innately

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:90%
wrong in our body.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We get that whole feeling,
that pit in our stomach,

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the closing of our throat.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:90%
We're worried.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
We know when there's
something wrong.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.030 align:middle line:84%
In order to stay well and
healthy in today's society

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.240 align:middle line:84%
is to just listen to that
gut intuition and that gut

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:84%
instinct, because
we're all born with it.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:90%
It's just trained out of us.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You can fire any medical
or health practitioner that

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:90%
isn't doing your work for you.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
hearing you, if you

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
don't have a good
relationship with them,

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:84%
if you don't feel like you can
tell them whatever you need,

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that is not a good person
for you to work with.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody that comes in
here is a good person for me

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:90%
to work with.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people need to be spoken
to in a really different way

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:90%
than I'm going to be able to do.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's good.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Go find somebody
who can help you.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of my mom
is a very personal one,

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and it was when my thermography
job became my thermography

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.630 align:middle line:90%
passion.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So we do a thermogram, and
she has a notable amount

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
of more heat in her left
breast than her right, which

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
thermographically is suspicious
because the breasts should

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:90%
be somewhat symmetrical.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So even if you have a crazy
lymphatic line in one,

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you should have a crazy
lymphatic line in the other,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
arguably.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:90%
So we do a thermogram on my mom.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I find this heat pattern,
and I'm like, mom,

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd be more comfortable
if you got an ultrasound.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Because an ultrasound
is the only thing

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that can differentiate
between a solid mass--

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:90%
that would be a tumor--

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.995 align:middle line:84%
or a fluid-filled cyst-- that
would be just a benign cyst

00:33:44.995 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:90%
or fibrocyst in the breast.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And so she gets an ultrasound.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's a solid
mass, they find.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:90%
The ultrasound found it.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And then she gets a biopsy, and
it's cancer in the left breast.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So a mammogram that she had six
months prior to this thermogram

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:90%
missed it completely.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The thermogram found the heat,
the ultrasound found the tumor,

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:84%
and then the biopsy
confirmed that it was cancer.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was stage two
cancer in the left breast.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor wanted her
to do a double mastectomy,

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:84%
so both breasts removed,
with chemo and radiation.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, hell, no.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
you're doing this.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You are in charge of your
own health and well-being.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
And as exhausting as
it is to keep looking,

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I think you just got to
keep going until you feel

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.770 align:middle line:84%
some resonance with
somebody or somebodies

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
who feel like they're
actually doing something

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:90%
that makes sense to you.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So I became my mom's
patient advocate at that moment

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't
know what to do.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.409 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors were bullying
her into this double mastectomy

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.835 align:middle line:84%
and telling her that if
she has it in one breast,

00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:84%
it could come back
in the other breast,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:90%
and she needs to do radiation.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.780 align:middle line:90%
She needs to do chemotherapy.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I was just like, no.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.178 align:middle line:84%
We're not doing any
of these things.

00:35:01.178 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I will be the patient advocate.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been working in the
thermography alternative

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.110 align:middle line:84%
holistic health community
for a long time.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So I will now be your
patient advocate.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't
be strong for yourself

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and if you are really feeling
that your doctor is bullying

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.170 align:middle line:84%
you, you just need
to find someone

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:90%
who will stand up for you.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a mom that
has a feisty daughter,

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:84%
usually the daughter can
be the patient advocate.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I became.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So I told my mom she
could get a lumpectomy,

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
because a lumpectomy is just the
removal of the cancerous site

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
entire breast itself.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we treated her
with the Gerson Therapy.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So the Gerson Therapy
is a natural way

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:84%
of healing the body through
nutrition, dietary supplements,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
juicing, enemas,
and dry brushing,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But what it does is it
stimulates the liver.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:84%
It stimulates the
lymphatic system.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it also doesn't
introduce any sort

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.360 align:middle line:90%
of antibiotic in a meat.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So she was eating healthy,
she was exercising,

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:90%
and she was visualizing.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And to this day, she's fine.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:90%
And that was six years ago.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that if I could
offer up any kind of advice

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.490 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else who is in
their own challenging invisible

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:84%
illness, it would be to know
that whatever you are doing

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:21.460 align:middle line:84%
at any given moment is
actually what's right for you.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I have been dealing with
this now for over six years,

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I am so much more comfortable
and I feel so much more capable

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
than I did in the beginning
with challenging a doctor

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:90%
or with asking more questions.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think back to when I
was very first diagnosed,

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and I was just so afraid, and
I felt so lost that it just--

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
the only thing I
could even think to do

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:84%
was whatever my
doctors told me to do.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of ways that
was right, and in some ways

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:90%
that was wrong.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But I made that decision at the
time based on the information

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you
can find any compassion

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
to have with yourself, and with
the decisions that you make,

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and to know that even
as things may get harder

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:84%
or as treatments might not work,
you're still actually learning.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:84%
You're still actually
learning about the illness

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that you're living with, you're
learning about your voice,

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're learning
what is actually

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:90%
right and wrong for your body.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My advice to somebody that's
dealing with an invisible

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:84%
illness or a chronic disease
would be to be your own

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:44.440 align:middle line:84%
advocate first and foremost, to
not give up hope that there are

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:90%
answers out there.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:84%
You could look up diseases,
and time and time again you'll

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%
find there's no known cause.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:84%
No known cause is the typical
standard for so many diseases.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there is
a cause for all disease.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so continue to search,
and to ask questions, and be

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:90%
curious about your body.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea of being
able to care for myself

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and take my health
care in my own hands

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:90%
was really attractive to me.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So I consider us all
healers, in the sense

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that if we start to investigate
how our body functions,

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and who we are, and what
are the things that drive us

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.250 align:middle line:90%
further away from balance--

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.207 align:middle line:90%
and we start to minimize those--

00:38:32.207 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and what are the things that
draw us closer to balance--

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and we start to maximize those.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Then we're healers.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:90%
We're healing ourself.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
very empowering

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
to think of ourselves
in that way.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So the health industry
doesn't really care about

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.930 align:middle line:84%
people who have these
strange ailments.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The doctors that I
hear the best things about

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:12.710 align:middle line:84%
in my practice seem to be
better at being more responsive

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and cultivating more of
that artistic element.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:22.550 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be better at
looking at a whole person,

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:25.040 align:middle line:84%
listening to a whole
person, trying to figure out

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.860 align:middle line:84%
what's best for
them in any realm,

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and getting them to
go that direction.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything that's not Western
medicine they don't want to pay

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.840 align:middle line:90%
for in America.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I've spent thousands of
dollars out of my own pocket

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.680 align:middle line:84%
or are in debt still
because of trying

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to get testing done to
test food allergies,

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:84%
test hormones, test
this, test that,

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:48.680 align:middle line:90%
all these different tests.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.153 align:middle line:84%
And my health insurance
could say, oh, yeah,

00:39:52.153 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
we'll cover this, oh, we're
not going to cover this.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's just they don't care.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I feel invisible
to the health industry.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Our medical system in
the United States is what is

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.063 align:middle line:90%
considered a sick care model.

00:40:05.063 --> 00:40:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So our doctors get
paid when we're sick,

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:90%
not when we're well.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer is a
billion dollar industry

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So you get a mammogram, which
is 40 pounds of pressure

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:18.160 align:middle line:84%
per square inch and ionizing
radiation that's scientifically

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.960 align:middle line:90%
proven to cause breast cancer.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And now you're a customer.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.497 align:middle line:90%
So you got the mammogram.

00:40:22.497 --> 00:40:23.830 align:middle line:90%
They might have found something.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:24.670 align:middle line:90%
They might not have.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to get a
second mammogram

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because a mammogram can't
differentiate between really

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.300 align:middle line:84%
anything in the breast,
between dense breast,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:84%
fibroadenomas, cancer,
microcalcifications.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It actually can't
see the difference.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So then you'll get
recommended another mammogram.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And then let's just say
it's a false diagnosis.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.448 align:middle line:84%
So they say you have breast
cancer, and you don't.

00:40:43.448 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Now you think you
have breast cancer,

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.590 align:middle line:84%
so you're terrified, all
that emotional stress.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Now you're getting
potentially treatment

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:90%
that's harmful to you.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the treatment is
radiation, chemotherapy,

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and surgery, which radiation,
again, causes cancer.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Chemotherapy is poison that
strips the immune system.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The way chemotherapy
works is it kills

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you, and your immune
system, and the cancer.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you win,
sometimes the cancer wins.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But there is a slide
in my presentation

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that has a doctor, a 1950s
advertisement showing

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that doctors recommend Lucky
Strikes 50% of the time

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:90%
more than others.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, we now know
that cigarettes cause cancer.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very easy to think
that doctors maybe don't have

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:90%
our best interests in mind.

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:84%
They're just doing
what they need

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to do to survive, just
like everyone else.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is doctors
are supposed to help us.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So because I work with
women and because I

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:84%
work in this
industry, I hear all

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.930 align:middle line:84%
of the horror stories
of women getting

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:90%
bullied into getting mammograms.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And their doctor will
actually yell at them

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:90%
if they don't want a mammogram.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
told what to do,

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
but, again, it goes against
that internal compass.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And so then you have a very
conflicted patient and woman

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.390 align:middle line:84%
because she's on one side,
this doesn't feel or sound

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:84%
right, but my doctor,
someone that I trust,

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and someone who
practices medicine,

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and someone that I'm supposed
to be able to count on,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:84%
they're bullying me into this,
but it doesn't feel good.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So I always jokingly
say, if the only way

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to scan for
testicular cancer was

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.900 align:middle line:84%
a vice that creates 40 pounds
of pressure and radiates,

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure guys would
invent something the next day.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to
traditional medicine--

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say
conventional medicine--

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.360 align:middle line:84%
the biggest issue
that I take is that I

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:84%
feel like we're a little
bit misguided in our focus.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we're so obsessed
with finding the cure

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:84%
that we forgot to ask a real
fundamental question, which

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:90%
is why?

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Why is this occurring?

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if we start to
investigate the why,

00:42:55.330 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
then we see that we can start
to find the cause so that we

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.610 align:middle line:84%
can start to really
give people the tools

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that they'll need in order
to really start to heal.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:84%
We're chasing symptoms, and
we're trying to patch holes.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But the roots of those
diseases still exist.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I was really to invent
my own ideal world of health

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:84%
care and professionals, I
think that the thing first

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and foremost that I would
want to do is, honestly,

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:84%
throw out all of the
statistics and all of the--

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:84%
these are the
patterns that we have

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:39.265 align:middle line:84%
of what has worked for somebody
who looks like you, who

00:43:39.265 --> 00:43:42.930 align:middle line:84%
is the same age, who is the
same weight, who is blah, blah,

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:90%
blah.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have
learned in my experience

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:53.950 align:middle line:84%
is that our bodies are all
so extraordinarily different,

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and our physical body
is so intertwined

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:84%
with our emotional body,
and our spiritual body,

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and our mental body that
what is the exact right

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:11.710 align:middle line:84%
combination for you of
support in all of those areas

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and nourishment in
all of those areas,

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.560 align:middle line:84%
there's absolutely no way that's
going to be the exact right

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:90%
combination for me.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that while there's
a lot of doctors who are really

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:31.420 align:middle line:84%
doing their best, they look
at you as one of a data set.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not working,
then it's this big question,

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and they still don't
look outside that set.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.770 align:middle line:84%
They continue looking in
this little group of people,

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to see, well,
what's worked for her,

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.827 align:middle line:84%
and what's worked for her,
and what's worked for her

00:44:45.827 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:84%
rather than looking at
this larger picture of you

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:90%
are your own unique individual.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be all
these different experiences

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.470 align:middle line:84%
coming at you and all these
different histories of what

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.680 align:middle line:84%
you've gone through mentally,
physically, emotionally

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that are adding up
to what is in you.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So the reason why it's really
hard for people with chronic

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:12.790 align:middle line:84%
illness to get help from doctors
is sometimes the doctors just

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:14.410 align:middle line:90%
simply don't believe them.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, that wears on the
psyche of clients and patients

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
who are just trying
to receive help.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But if the blood tests come
back normal and everything looks

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.220 align:middle line:84%
normal on paper, then
doctors are like, well,

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.930 align:middle line:84%
clearly there's
nothing wrong with you

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.710 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
wrong on my chart,

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:32.377 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
wrong in your blood,

00:45:32.377 --> 00:45:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
within normal range.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.110 align:middle line:84%
But my within normal
range is different

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.930 align:middle line:84%
from your normal range is
different from someone else's

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:41.920 align:middle line:90%
normal range.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's really hard
to do a blood panel

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and just look at this
two-dimensional sheet of paper

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and be like, yep, you're
all within normal range

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:84%
when you have a
three-dimensional person

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.436 align:middle line:90%
sitting next to you.

00:45:53.436 --> 00:45:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> [SIGHS] If I had a dream, it
would be that people would have

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.970 align:middle line:84%
a person who could look at a
whole bunch of things that were

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:05.050 align:middle line:84%
going on for them and go, oh,
those two things don't work

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:09.250 align:middle line:84%
together very well, or you're
not getting as much of this

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.275 align:middle line:84%
as you might, whether
that's exercise or--

00:46:13.275 --> 00:46:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
people are trying

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:17.470 align:middle line:90%
to do that now, but just--

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
or that people would be able
to do that for themselves more.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.970 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
lovely, lovely thing.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.700 align:middle line:84%
If there was enough
information, education

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.940 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't confusing out
there where people could

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.090 align:middle line:84%
get a sense of, this is
how I should be feeling,

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:84%
these are some things that
might be contributing to me not

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.820 align:middle line:84%
feeling that way, what
can I do about it?

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If I had all of the power
to somehow shift and heal

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.960 align:middle line:90%
the whole system--

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really what I want most
is for the power to really feel

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.560 align:middle line:84%
like it comes back to the
individual seeking support

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and for the system to really
honor that when we show up

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.520 align:middle line:84%
to any kind of health
care professional

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're hiring
them to support us.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And the power dynamic
shifts around.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:12.100 align:middle line:84%
We're paying them for
their time, and expertise,

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and support, and that
that really is honored

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:90%
and in that orientation.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, ideally
there'd be health care

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
for all as part of, yeah, our
government benefits of being

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:90%
a citizen and living here.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.750 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to get into
the politics of all of that,

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:41.650 align:middle line:84%
but it just feels like it's
a fundamental human right

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to receive care and support
for our own well-being.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And as citizens
of any country, we

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.060 align:middle line:84%
are paying taxes to
support, ideally,

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:90%
the well-being of the citizens.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And that just seems
absolutely foundational.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If I can pray for the doctor
to arrive who would be perfect

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:11.350 align:middle line:84%
for me, it would be someone
who is really ready to look

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
at every piece of me,
like all of the bodies

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences
that make up me,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and for them to come from
that place and then prescribe

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:37.960 align:middle line:84%
a treatment regimen rather than
looking up in a book the next

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:84%
best thing and saying,
do this and report back.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The body knows
how to heal itself.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:84%
We just need to give our
body the proper nutrients

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.640 align:middle line:90%
so that it can heal itself.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And we also need to believe
that it can heal itself.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things that
the pharmaceutical companies

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.580 align:middle line:84%
really cash in on
is our disbelief

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.260 align:middle line:90%
that our body can heal itself.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't think
that we can heal ourselves,

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.250 align:middle line:90%
we need someone else to.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is usually
in the form of a pill.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe that your body
has the ability and capacity

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to heal itself at any given
moment, that right there is

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.440 align:middle line:84%
what will heal
your body, is what

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.690 align:middle line:84%
will inspire health and
wellness in the body.

Happy birthday to you.

>> If I were to speak to kids
who were in this situation,

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I would also tell them that any
question is a great question

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and that they have every
right to feel all the feelings

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.240 align:middle line:90%
they're feeling.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes life
sucks, but it's also

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.000 align:middle line:84%
this disease is what makes
you and your family unique.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's also a gift.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's also
always blessings that come

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:90%
with disease and disorders.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's hard to see
for people sometimes.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that disease
makes us more human, and more

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:36.480 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable, and able to
communicate about tough things.

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's a challenge that every
family needs to rise up to,

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just tell
the kid that they're OK,

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
so loved, and try

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to just talk through
fear because you

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
don't want to hold on to fear.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.268 align:middle line:84%
That's the worst,
fear and shame.

And sometimes it can be
unfair, but that's how life is.

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:18.070 align:middle line:84%
It's sad because you used to
have this life where you were

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.370 align:middle line:84%
open to everything, but
now you are restricted

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to all the things you can eat
and lots of the other things

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.570 align:middle line:84%
you can do like walk,
or run, or exercise.

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But be grateful that
you're still alive

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and that you can still live the
life that you wanted to live.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.470 align:middle line:84%
She got her payment for
getting run over by the car.

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:38.270 align:middle line:90%
She finally got it.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed us,
actually, to travel.

So sometimes when
you get hurt, you

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%

it's just not that big a deal.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.232 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think it's
taught me a lot.

00:52:23.232 --> 00:52:25.440 align:middle line:84%
You definitely think about
how much other people take

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.560 align:middle line:84%
for granted when
you're around someone

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.650 align:middle line:84%
with this type of
invisible illness.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.160 align:middle line:84%
For a long time I was
resentful because I was like,

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.578 align:middle line:84%
I have to change myself because
of this when I'm already

00:52:39.578 --> 00:52:40.870 align:middle line:90%
going through so many problems.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:43.480 align:middle line:90%
But, again, you just grow up.

Makes you grow up a little
bit faster, appreciate

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.320 align:middle line:84%
what you have and just try
to make the best of things

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the really impactful
lessons that I've learned about

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:58.630 align:middle line:84%
healing is that healing
is not black and white.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not a yes or no.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It's much more alive than that.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And we may not ever be free
of the hindrances of some

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:84%
of our illnesses,
but the reality

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.880 align:middle line:84%
is that we can
still find healing.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And we can still heal every
day for the rest of our lives,

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:22.590 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the doctors say,
or what the diagnosis says,

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:84%
or even if we're still
dealing with sleep issues,

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.130 align:middle line:90%
or digestive issues, or pain.

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Our interpretation of what
healing is and what it means

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.930 align:middle line:84%
can have such an impact on
how we feel about ourselves

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and how we feel about the
lives that we're given to live.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't change a thing.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Because with all of that, I
can avert crisis, and misery,

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and death for other people,
and be a way shower,

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and shine a light on a path
that's an easier, softer way,

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and open a door to
happiness, and joyousness,

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and peacefulness, and
youthfulness, and prosperity,

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and abundance, and wholeness,
and unity, and power, and joy,

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and strength, and beauty.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.548 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trade
anything for it now.
