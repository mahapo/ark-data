00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Roger Nelson, and I'm
nowadays doing the Global

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness Project.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:10%
But that's sort of a
derivative, an expansion

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
from the PEAR laboratory work.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:10%
PEAR means Princeton
Engineering Anomalies Research.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:10%
It was a program that started
in about 1979 in the Engineering

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:10%
School of Princeton,
run by Robert John

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:10%
and managed Brenda Dunn.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
I came in 1980 and
spent 22 years there

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
before I retired,
doing things that

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
sound a little
strange to people,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
but which are actually
quite important when

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:90%
we think about consciousness.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
What happens at the edges
of what we know about

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Is there any real
presence of consciousness

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So we set up experiments
to ask that question

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and got an answer,
which was yes.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Not a big surprise
to people who are

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
interested in spiritual matters,
but a terribly difficult thing

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
for most mainstream scientists
to accept or themselves take

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:90%
any time really to examine.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In 1997 I started
doing something

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
which turned into what we now
call the Global Consciousness

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.766 align:middle line:84%
Project, which is looking at
the entire world in a way.

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
We're using our same
kind of technology

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:84%
we developed in the
lab but now to look

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
at the kind of
non-local consciousness

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be a real
presence in the world.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, there are over 60
Random Event Generators placed

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:10%
The numbers that come
into the generators

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:10%
during normal random events
for global consciousness

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:10%
are just that--

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:10%
random.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Several hours in
advance of a major world

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
event, nonrandom coherent
numbers are present.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
A large spike in
the data waveform

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
appears, giving a precognition
that a major event is

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:90%
about to occur.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Hours before the
November 4, 1995

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
assassination of Nobel
Peace Prize winner

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin, a continuous running REG

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
saw a major spike
developing, which

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
peaked at the time
of his murder,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the loss
of a true peacemaker

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and a man of compassion.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
If something like
Princess Diana's funeral

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
was bringing 2 billion people
to think about the same thing

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and maybe feel sadness
or compassion together,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
then we should try to
see whether our machines,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
our Random Event Generators,
could detect that,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
could react to it.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So in that particular
case I asked

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
all of my colleagues,
friends who

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
did the same kind of
research, please take data.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
We had several lines
of data in Europe,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
several lines of data in this
country, put them all together,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and remarkably enough-- or
maybe not so surprising if you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
believe the data from the
laboratory experiments--

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
we have a big, strong effect.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
If you did the same
thing 100 times,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't see the size
of change in our REG devices

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that we saw during the time of
the funeral for Princess Diana.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The September 6, 1997 funeral
of Princess Diana yielded

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:10%
a major signal in the data.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:10%
Global compassion following a
tragedy of major world figures

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:10%
or world loss of life
yielded the strongest spikes

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:10%
in the data.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And on 9/11, when
the first plane hit--

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
8:45 in the morning--

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the data started changing
in an unmistakable way

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
about between 4 and 5
o'clock in the morning.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:10%
>> In the case of the September
11 World Trade Center attacks

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:10%
in New York, the REGs measured
a warning spike four hours

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:10%
in advance of the first plane
strike and continued measuring

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:10%
the ensuing events
and public reactions.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Deep feelings of compassion
enveloped the world,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and a 50 hour trend
ensued in the data,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the profound
effects of the event itself.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The Global Consciousness
Network has scientific data

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
showing similar
responses to many world

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
events, such as Earth Day
and world healing events.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Major earthquakes
reflect in the data hours

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
in advance of the
actual earthquakes,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
showing that the Global
Consciousness Field is not

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
limited to what human
beings directly perceive.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:10%
>> These generators,
Random Event Generators--

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:10%
we usually just call them
REGs, sometimes RNGs for Random

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:10%
Number Generators--

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:10%
they're a very standard
tool in the armamentarium

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:10%
of psychic researchers.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:90%
They do a good job.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They present a system
that's easy to understand,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and one in which it's
relatively easy to see something

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:90%
that shouldn't be there.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
That is, if consciousness
changes the way the world is,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
these Random Event Generators
constitute a very sensitive way

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:90%
of asking that question.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Does my intention to get high
numbers result in high numbers?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, over years
and years of experimentation,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:90%
is that it does.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It won't be enough to
win at the casinos.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:90%
They have too big an advantage.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's real, and the
implication is huge.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That means that consciousness
is or intention is not

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.700 align:middle line:90%
confined to your scope.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not in here.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:90%
It's out in the world.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's out in
the world to vast distances.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows,
but there may be

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
a kind of infinite expanse
of your consciousness.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
What could this possibly mean?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it has to mean something
like a bigger consciousness

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
than we know or can
perceive that's at work.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Something like what
Teilhard de Chardin

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
thought of as the kind of
next phase in human evolution.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Teilhard was a theologian,
but he was also a scientist.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And he described
evolution from particles

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
to small molecules to large
molecules and living molecules

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and eventually to
us, human beings.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Gradually more and
more complicated

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:84%
in evolutionary terms until we
reach what some people have,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I guess you might say,
egoistically considered

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.555 align:middle line:90%
to be the pinnacle.

00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Teilhard de Chardin said,
no, we're not finished yet.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
We still have another round
of evolution, at least.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And that he considered was to
develop a kind of coherence

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
among the human
beings on this Earth

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to coordinate and become
a shell of intelligence

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:90%
covering the Earth.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:10%
He actually used the name
"noosphere" to describe that.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
A shell of intelligence
and thinking

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
that would cover the Earth
and be the mind of Gaia,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether we can
really make a strong case.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But to me, the
evidence looks like it

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:84%
points in the direction
of there being really

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:90%
a Gaia mind, of sorts.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:44.274 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly composed of us,
almost as if we're neurons.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And neurons, as you
undoubtedly are aware,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:84%
really don't know
much in themselves.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And they just do their job.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
They certainly don't
know about mind,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
about falling in love,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
as far as we can tell.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, neurons
create this mind

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:90%
that we use to think about mind.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that
we human beings

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:90%
are analogous to neurons.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
There happen to be or
approaching the same number

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of human beings on
planet Earth as there

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:90%
are neurons in the human brain.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that
that's no coincidence.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So what this means is we
have an intelligent universe,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that atoms are talking to each
other all the time at the speed

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of light, which means
if you have a thought,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that that thought can propagate
through the space-time medium

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
through the inter-exchange of
communication between atoms.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The countless
trillions and trillions

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.854 align:middle line:84%
of atoms in the
universe, and all the way

00:09:44.854 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to a google, the greatest
number ever counted.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every atom is talking
to each other, which means

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:90%
atoms are the God particle.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.385 align:middle line:90%
They're recording our lives.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:10%
They're recording
everything that's happening.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:10%
That consciousness is non-local,
that we can transfer our brain

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:10%
waves into atomic
structures, which

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:10%
then communicate in the quantum
field to the whole universe.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:90%
They're talking to each other.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.223 align:middle line:90%
This is so exciting.

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Book of
Enoch, chapter 68,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
the crimes of numerous fallen
angels are being cited.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:10%
Quote, "The fourth
fallen angel is Penemue.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:10%
He taught men to
understand writing

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:10%
and the use of ink and paper.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, numerous
have been those

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:10%
who have gone astray from
every period of the world,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:10%
even to this day.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:10%
For men were not born for this;
thus with pen and with ink

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:10%
to confirm their faith;
since they were not

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:10%
created, except that,
like the angels,

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:10%
they might remain
righteous and pure."

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
What if humankind, like
angels, had direct access

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:90%
to true knowledge?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:10%
We would not have to rely
on the many lies, truths,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:10%
and deceptions of
our testimonies

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:10%
regarding knowledge,
history, and crimes

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:10%
written by the ink and pen.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
If true knowledge to
any historical event

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
could be accessed from
the atom, humankind

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
would triumph over its
reliance on the written word,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
making it an obsolete
form of archiving history.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
If we could access and
extract all historical truth

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
from the atom, we would have the
world's first perfect archive

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
of our history.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:10%
>> The yogis in ancient India
say that if you could go

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:10%
into a state of samadhi and your
aura merges with, for example,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:10%
a tree, you could actually
have real knowledge, real,

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:10%
actual knowledge of everything
that tree has known and every

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:10%
historical event that has
happened in the presence

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:10%
of that tree, which means that
it's possible in the future--

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:10%
maybe 200 years from
now, for example--

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:10%
we could go to the trees
where John F. Kennedy was

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:10%
assassinated at Dealey
Plaza in the year 2030,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and we could ask those
trees to extract.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:10%
We could actually extract
the data on a particular date

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:10%
when John F. Kennedy
was assassinated.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And we could actually
get the real data of what

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:90%
the trees recorded that day.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Do the trees know
who the shooter was?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Do they know where
the bullets came from?

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Did it really come
from above the trees

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
where Lee Harvey Oswald was
in the book suppository?

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Did it come from the lone
gunman behind the fence?

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Did it come from
the storm drain?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Did come from the overpass?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Will the tree actually know?

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And if atoms record
all information

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and we can actually
do this, this

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
means this is the end of false
testimony and court cases

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:90%
where a criminal gets off.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
We could know the truth
about every historical event,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.569 align:middle line:84%
every crime, every
political scandal.

00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we could
go all the way back

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
to the time of
Christ in Jerusalem,

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and we could ask the
stones to show us

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
the real pictures for
the first time in history

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and the real words
that Jesus spoke

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:90%
and what actually happened.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have to rely on
the written word anymore.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
We could actually rely on
the truth recorded in the god

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.931 align:middle line:90%
particle, the atom itself.

00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:90%

near-death experiencers say,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
especially when they're
having these very transcendent

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
experiences, that they
seem to know everything.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
All universal mysteries.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:10%
They ask, and they seem to
have information or answers

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:10%
to their questions, even at
the moment that they ask,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:10%
which is very dramatic in terms
of the knowledge they get.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:10%
That could happen
in variable times

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.674 align:middle line:10%
during the near-death
experience,

00:14:09.674 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:10%
but it's usually deeper into
the experience and actually

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:10%
getting close to the time
where the experience ends.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:84%
They're really that
deep into the experience

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:90%
before they have that.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
virtually everybody

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that has this type of exposure
to universal knowledge

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is unable to bring
it back to Earth.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's been described
dramatically in one account

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
as being an effort to try to
fit a whole ocean of knowledge

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that they had during their
near-death experience

into the teacup
that's their brain.

And so that's how one
near-death experiencer said,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I can't, I can't
remember it all or retain

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
all this incredible
knowledge that I

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
had during my
near-death experience

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:90%
that was shared with me.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:90%

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:10%
Took me years.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:10%

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.155 align:middle line:90%
That's what it sounds like.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:06.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:09.192 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can
do a lot of things.

00:15:09.192 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So I've been working on the
P series projects, which

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
People, Plants,
Planets, and Particles,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and the exploration of the
hidden energetic interchanges

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that happen between these
various micro and macro

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:90%
elements of our universe.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:10%
So the first
experiments I've been

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:10%
doing have been with plants,
and that would be the P1 series,

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.515 align:middle line:10%
because it's one interactive
part of it, which

00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:10%
is the plant bit.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:10%
And I developed a system,
both hardware and software,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:55.672 align:middle line:10%
to take the bioenergetic
emissions of plant leaves,

00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:10%
and then assigned
those fluctuating

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:10%
signals to various
components of sound design,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:10%
and thus allow the
plants to create a fabric

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:10%
tapestry of sound that
conveys what they're doing

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:10%
and how they're being
affected by their environment

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:10%
and responding to it.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So I developed this
a couple of years

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
ago with funding from
the Innovation Center

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
at the London
School of Economics

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and some monetary support by EDS
who ran the Innovation Center

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and came up with this
stuff and made with it

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
a kind of interspecies
improvisational system, where

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
people have several
senses to play with,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
which constitute piece
of generative music

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that the plant's
music then mixes with,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and you get this lush harmonic
soundscape that's constantly

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
changing according to the
environment and people's

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.442 align:middle line:84%
interaction with the
senses in the plants.

00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:07.914 align:middle line:90%

What is the secret
of the tree of life?

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Tree is considered very sacred
in ancient Hindu mythology.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Tree is supposed to host all

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:84%
just for our own use or
benefit, but honor them

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.813 align:middle line:84%
as you honor any
other human being.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:90%
As they are part--

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
they have the right to
exist in the creation,

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and they're part of
this whole creation.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe
is one organism,

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and tree is a
vital part of that.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In Jewish Kabbalah, the tree
of life represents the process

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
by which the universe
came into being.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But the tree of life is
really a multidimensional map.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So you relate it first
to the human body.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
that's not the way

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:90%
it's taught or well understood.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.336 align:middle line:90%
It's usually understood as--

00:19:46.336 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:90%
how to say it?

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
A collection of
divine qualities--

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
wisdom, understanding,
love, will, harmony.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:10%
But as an astrologer,
I see it kind of

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:10%
nested in the nervous system.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:10%
And they are spiritual
qualities, and also

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.897 align:middle line:10%
endocrine glands as well.

00:20:07.897 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:10%
And I can even relate
the tree of life

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:10%
to Chinese medicine, which has
some parallels to Kabbalah.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, the simple,
central sphere is simply--

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Keter is the crown chakra.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:10%
Da'at would be
the throat chakra.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Tiferet is the heart.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Yesod is the belly.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.855 align:middle line:84%
And then Malkhut is
the base of the spine

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and the soles of the feet.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But then the ones that
are the polarities,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the hemispheres of the
brain, Hokhmah and Binah.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And Hesed and Gavurah I'd
say in Chinese medicine

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
would be the lungs and
the gall bladder, liver.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And then Hod and Netzah would
be the kidney, adrenal function,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and the pancreas spleen
function in terms of organs.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
There are some fascinating ways
of looking at the tree of life

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
as basically an organizational
system that could be applied

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:90%
to a company, a government.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Any social structure
has to have that kind

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
of checks and balances.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of finding
unity consciousness

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:90%
in a polarity field.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Kabbalah
is about that.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about balancing
soul qualities

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
so that you're in
harmony with the creator.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Buddha attained his full
enlightenment after meditating

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
under the sacred
Bodhi Tree in 623 BCE.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:10%
What was his
relationship to the tree?

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:10%
Did he know the secret
of the tree of life?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.570 align:middle line:10%
Why did Jesus pray
among the olive trees

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:10%
in the Garden of Gethsemane the
night before he was crucified?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Why did the gnostic
Christian gospels all

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
refer to the
crucifixion of Christ

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
as being nailed to a
tree instead of a cross?

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Why does the English Bible
translation find the same?

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Immediately after Jesus
prayed to the father while

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
beneath the olive trees,
an angel heard his call

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and appeared by him
to give him strength.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Do trees act as
transmitters and receivers

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with angels, God,
and the spiritual dimensions?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Deeper.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> So the plants are alive.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
You're proving, scientifically,
that they are conscious?

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In her plant research,
Mileece has found that plants

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
can communicate with humans
through a musical interface.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, I wouldn't
say I'm proving anything

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:10%
scientifically, because as
soon as you do that you subject

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:10%
yourself to scientific scrutiny,
which is a world that I find

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:10%
to be a bit contrarian
and uninviting.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:10%
So this is why I do this work
within the context of art.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like art,
and it behaves like art.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:90%
People behave in it like art.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:10%
It's something that
you go to and you

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:10%
are moved, and emotionally
touched, and spiritually

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:10%
awakened, and removed
from your daily life,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:10%
and put in some way alternate
that you would never perhaps

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:10%
have access to.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:10%
So in that respect
it's entirely art.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:10%
What the indications of
that art are definitely

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:10%
obvious when you have the
experiences of touching them

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:10%
and hearing what's going on.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.287 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:24:02.287 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the oddest part?

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:90%
That they're alive?

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.100 align:middle line:84%
That what you do has an
immediate and tangible effect

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
on their electromagnetic
emissions.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.922 align:middle line:90%
What that means, you can't say.

00:24:14.922 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
You can;t say it's an
emotional response.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
You can't say these
things because we

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
don't have the ability to
quantify what really is going

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:84%
on, and it would be wrong
to start to make judgments

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:90%
upon that, I think.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the basic notion is
there are energetic exchanges

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that are happening all the
time that we cannot perceive

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
the mechanisms to do so.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And this is a way, through
something beautiful,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:10%
through an artistic
expression of it,

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:10%
that you can have a
mechanism to do that.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, specifically
sound with plant

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and human interaction
is useful because plants

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
react to sound
simultaneously as do humans.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of how
we as a species are,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:90%
we view time very differently.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our time is very
fast compared to plants,

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's a problem
with people relating

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:90%
to the livingness of plants.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they move so slowly,
they seem inanimate and perhaps

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.960 align:middle line:90%
not even alive.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So having a sonic interaction
that is real time and reckoned

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:84%
by both species
at the same moment

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
allows for a bridge over
that sort of gray area

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
that we can't seem to get over.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we
wouldn't do a lot of things

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that we do to plants if we
had this sort of ability

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:90%
to real time interact with them.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But what if we could
develop a language with them?

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%
What powers would
we possess then?

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.658 align:middle line:84%
Could we ask them for the
secret to the tree of life?

00:25:58.658 --> 00:26:02.116 align:middle line:90%

One of them is Thomas
Merton, Father Thomas Merton.

>> Thomas Merton, a
Trappist Catholic monk,

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most influential
Catholic writers of the 20th

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:90%
century.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> He would like to get
every ancient religion,

especially Buddhism, and
compare with Christianity.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> He was one of the first
modern Christian icons

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to challenge that belief alone
was insufficient for the soul.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus Christ came to this
world to express his message,

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:90%
which is his love.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Here, Thomas Merton had found
it in even a Buddhist text also.

He tried to get
that Buddhist where

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
we call Metta, universal
love, loving kindness.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
He tried to compare with
Christian way of thinking.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> He sought a more direct
experience of Jesus and God.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, he met with
Tibetan Buddhists Dzogchen

the Dalai Lama of Tibet,

of his spiritual literary
works, the Catholic church

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:10%
now has a common dialogue
with the Buddhists

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.260 align:middle line:10%

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:90%
They try to absorb especially.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
They try to practice meditation
thanks to the Father Thomas

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Merton.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:30.056 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.056 --> 00:29:32.320 align:middle line:84%
In Asia, especially
in Sri Lanka,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.114 align:middle line:84%
we had a very bad experience
with Christianity, specifically

00:29:38.114 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Catholicism.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:10%
100, 200 years ago, when foreign
invaders came to Sri Lanka,

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:10%
they tried to convert
Buddhist people by force

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:10%
and using sword.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:10%
Even a child get--

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.960 align:middle line:10%
any family members do not want
to convert to Christianity

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:10%
carrying the child
and throw in the sky

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.480 align:middle line:10%
and get shot and killed.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:10%
That's the way they
started converting people

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:10%
to Christianity.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Anyone want to go to school,
they must be Christian.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:30.975 align:middle line:84%
So then, thanks to one of our
great American leaders, Colonel

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Olcott, changed that
situation in Sri Lanka

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.410 align:middle line:90%
over 100 years ago.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Later on, as a result, as a
Buddhist, when we will grow up,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:84%
even we do not want to close to
sit with the Catholic fathers.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Even as a Buddhist,
we do not want

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to touch or hold Holy Bible.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to Father Thomas Merton
we also remove our fear.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the Jesus Christ
message is a greatest one.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It is not what our
missionaries who

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.830 align:middle line:84%
went to Sri Lanka converting,
doing so many nasty things.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:90%
No such a thing is not Bible.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Then Father Thomas Merton
wake up our souls also.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Clear our eyes.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:37.875 align:middle line:84%
Now you know, as a
result, even my library

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:43.665 align:middle line:84%
have both sides Buddhist books
and Christian books together.

00:31:43.665 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I respect so much Jesus Christ.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.375 align:middle line:90%
I read the Holy Bible.

00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Even call back so
many books I read.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Even I studied Christianity as a
result of meeting Father Thomas

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Merton.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
When I came to here, I went
to Northwestern University.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I studied Christianity with
Methodist ministers together.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Even myself, I removed my fear.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I have a great respect thanks
to the Father Thomas Merton.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> According to a 2007
Gallup opinion poll,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
an overwhelming 86% of Americans
believe in the personal God,

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
while 14% believe in a
higher universal power.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:84%
However, an amazing
39% of Americans

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:90%
are dissatisfied with religion.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Today, millions of
people are seeking

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:84%
a deeper experience
of enlightenment

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:90%
or direct communion with God.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Many are willing to change
their lives and their careers

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.405 align:middle line:84%
to find their own
experience of the truth.

00:32:54.405 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I first became interested in
human consciousness when I was

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:90%
in high school.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:90%
My dad is a physicist.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.144 align:middle line:10%
And he had a variety of books
on dreams and the brain.

00:33:12.144 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:10%
And so I did most of my
science fair projects,

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:10%
actually, on memory and dreams.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:10%
And when I approached
my college years

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:10%
I thought to myself, how I am
going to study consciousness?

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:10%
And so I actually enrolled
in medical school,

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.702 align:middle line:10%
and I was going to
become a neurosurgeon.

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
the way that one

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:90%
would dissect consciousness.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:84%
About six months in the college
my 20-year-old self said, I

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:90%
don't want to go to Med school.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.290 align:middle line:84%
That's a long time before
I'll be making money.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.582 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the
brain, electricity,

00:33:39.582 --> 00:33:40.540 align:middle line:90%
electrical engineering.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So I switched to
electrical engineering.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And for eight years I worked
in the avionics field.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I saw people who were
passionate about their jobs.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:90%
They loved them.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't passionate
about engineering.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hate it, but I
wasn't passionate about it.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:90%
So I started praying.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:90%
I believe in God.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.936 align:middle line:84%
I was raised with a
religious background

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and became more
spiritual over the years.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, God.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you are,
whatever you are,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.583 align:middle line:84%
would you please
guide me to something

00:34:04.583 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that is meant to be my passion,
my life, and my career.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And to make a very long story
short, books about angels

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.220 align:middle line:84%
started falling off the
shelves in the bookstores

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.436 align:middle line:84%
They would flip
open to pages that

00:34:15.436 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:84%
said, ask your angels
about career and finances.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd drop it like a
hotcake and go running

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
because it freaked me out.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.055 align:middle line:84%
But over time, I started
having dreams and visions.

00:34:24.055 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Apparitions of the Holy
Virgin Mary occurred in a poor

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:84%
district of Zeitoun, a suburb
of Cairo, Egypt in 1968.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:42.449 align:middle line:84%
Mary could be seen hovering
above a Coptic Christian church

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:90%
in a body of brilliant light.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:84%
From April 2, 1968
to 1970, there

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:53.290 align:middle line:84%
were hundreds of apparitions of
Mary in her resurrected body.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:84%
She was seen by millions of
people, Muslims and Christians

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
alike, who all prayed to
her as the mother of God.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
There were also documented
miraculous healings

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.230 align:middle line:90%
that took place.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
The photographer who
took these photographs

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
described how blinding and
dazzling the light of her body

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The story only made the back
pages of "The New York Times."

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:10%
From August of 2000
to January of 2001,

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:10%
the Virgin Mary appeared
again above a Coptic church

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:28.230 align:middle line:10%
in Asyut, Egypt, causing a
swarm of over 2 million people

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:10%
to come and see her
full body of white

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:10%
and to receive her
spiritual blessings.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:44.420 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Years ago, a friend
of mine, Charles Tart,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.810 align:middle line:84%
had a woman who claimed that she
could go out of her body while

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:90%
she was dreaming.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And so he put a ledge on
the top of the sleeper

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:90%
with five numbers on.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And after a few nights,
she was very excited.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, I just
was out of my body.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.452 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers
are 3, 8, 9, 5, 7.

00:36:07.452 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely correct.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:10%
In our laboratory, we decided
to repeat that experiment,

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.110 align:middle line:10%
not with numbers
but with a picture.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.580 align:middle line:10%
But we took very, very
careful procedures.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:10%
And we had a number of
illustrations from art museums.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.074 align:middle line:90%
And one was chosen randomly.

00:36:29.074 --> 00:36:30.526 align:middle line:90%
It was in an envelope.

00:36:30.526 --> 00:36:33.636 align:middle line:10%
And one of our assistants
took that envelope

00:36:33.636 --> 00:36:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and dropped the
picture on to the ledge

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:10%
on the top of the room.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew what
the picture was.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:90%
That was impossible to know.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.173 align:middle line:84%
A medical student,
night after night,

00:36:46.173 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
who claimed he could go out
of his body during dreaming,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.350 align:middle line:84%
tried to figure out
what that picture was.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
fourth night he did.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The fourth night there were
very, very, very strange brain

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Very slow brain waves.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've just had
a dream about a sunset.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the picture was called,
"Memory of a Perfect Sunset."

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the chances of
dreaming about a sunset

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:90%
are like 1 out of 50,000.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So either with numbers
for with pictures

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.020 align:middle line:84%
we've got two
experiments indicating

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that even though mind and
body are one, sometimes

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:84%
the mind takes a little
vacation from the body,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
just like the body takes a
little vacation from the mind.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.585 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes this does
happen during dreams.

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And when the paramedics got
there, I was actually passed.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I died.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:90%
So they had to revive me.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:10%
But what I remember is I was
in just the most unbelievably

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:10%
tremendous amount of pain that
anybody can possibly fathom.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.230 align:middle line:10%
It is just-- I feel
like childbirth

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:10%
is going to be a snap now.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But I was just in the
most tremendous pain.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying,
I wanted to go to sleep.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.960 align:middle line:90%
So I went to sleep.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know, I
watched the paramedics show up.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching this
from the corner of the room.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I was up there, and I was just--

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the second I left my body, I had
the most unbelievably peaceful

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:32.970 align:middle line:84%
feeling that anybody could
possibly fathom on Earth.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I floated up in the corner, and
I was going towards this light

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that I felt. I didn't
really see the light per se,

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:90%
but I felt it.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I kind
of stopped in the corner

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and was watching
what was going on,

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and then kept going
off into the light,

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and then had this
nonverbal voice.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't in English, but it
was this kind of voice in me

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that said that I had this
really amazing, strong purpose

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't my time to leave.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And as this was being
said, I could kind of

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.630 align:middle line:90%
see that I was being revived.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I just literally
shot back into my body.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
awful feeling,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:84%
because you have this amazing,
unworldly, peaceful feeling

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.490 align:middle line:90%
as soon as you leave your body.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you shoot back into
it, and it was right back

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:84%
into this excruciating,
horrible pain and confusion,

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing where I
was, or what happened,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and just knowing that I was
blind, and could hardly hear,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and had people screaming
and crying around me,

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and people banging on my chest.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't the greatest
feeling in the world.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.660 align:middle line:10%
>> In one dramatic
blind-from-birth individual

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:10%
that I interviewed--
her name was Vicki--

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:10%
she had a severe auto accident.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.000 align:middle line:10%
She was in the emergency room,
and she was clinically dying.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.040 align:middle line:10%
And her consciousness
separated from the body.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden
her point of reference

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:10%
was up on the roof,
near the roof,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.220 align:middle line:10%
near the ceiling of
the emergency room.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And she looked down and
saw a being laid out

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:90%
on an emergency room bed.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.069 align:middle line:90%
She was terrified.

00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:16.110 align:middle line:84%
This was the first visual
experience of her life,

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't know
what to do with it.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
She didn't even know that
that was her body until all

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden she correlated
what she had been able to feel

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:90%
in her life-- her long hair--

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and she felt a ring, of
course, when she was blind.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:90%
But now she could see it.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And she was able to correlate.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Only through correlating what
she'd previously known only

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.260 align:middle line:84%
through a sense of touch
with her sudden new visual

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.920 align:middle line:84%
impressions, she realized,
gosh, that's what I look like.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
incredible revelation.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Beginning of a
very, very detailed

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:90%
visual near-death experience.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> If we want to know the
absolute truth about how

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to experience enlightenment,
we can seek spiritual advice

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and leadership from those who
have attained enlightenment.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But if we can't have access
to enlightened teachers

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:11.690 align:middle line:84%
in the body, in the flesh,
one of the ways to do this

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.930 align:middle line:84%
is to ask for guidance
from our dreams, visions,

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and even to receive
our own apparitions

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of the ascended masters.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:23.460 align:middle line:84%
There are three ways
that visions can occur.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:84%
One is through direct
face-to-face apparitions

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
or appearances of
enlightened ones.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:84%
These appearances can
sometimes be private,

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:84%
where a neighboring
person to the visionary

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:84%
would not be able to
see the apparition.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Second is through
dreams, and third is

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:90%
during near-death experiences.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Religious figures have
been described in near-death

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:84%
experiences over
and over and over.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:10%
We have a relatively
small number

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:10%
of near-death experiences
from non-western countries.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:10%
So it's very rare that we have
a near-death experience that

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:10%
describes Buddha or Krishna,
although we have seen that.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The overwhelming majority of
experiences shared with us

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.930 align:middle line:84%
on the website are, of
course, from people that

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.640 align:middle line:90%
had a Christian background.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Jesus appears in about 5% to
10% of near-death experiences.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, strikingly,
there seems

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to be some amazing consistency
in how Jesus is described.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.525 align:middle line:84%
If Jesus is with other people
in a near-death experience,

00:42:21.525 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the great majority of the time
the near-death experiencer

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.160 align:middle line:84%
will feel an intensely loving
presence in this Jesus.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Far, far more than
the other people.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:84%
He may have more
light about him.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Often, when they interact with
Jesus, it's really interesting,

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of us
would have thought,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:84%
well, Jesus would
preach and sort of

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:84%
do you would expect to
do Jesus from the Bible.

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But in near-death experiences
Jesus' top priority seems

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to be to listen, seems to be
sharing love and compassion,

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:84%
seems to be to share
an overwhelming sense

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:84%
of acceptance with the
individual that they're with.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:13.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> In The Apocryphon of John, it
is written that 550 days after

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the crucifixion John was
suffering in the desert alone.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
In a blaze of light,
Jesus appears to him

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and transfigures three times,
from a young man to an old man,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and then into his servant.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says to John, John,
John, why do you doubt,

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:90%
or why are you afraid?

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You are not unfamiliar
with this image, are you?

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:90%
That is, do not be timid.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I am the one who
is with you always.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I am the father, I am
the mother, I am the son.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I am the undefiled
and incorruptible one.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But who is the servant if John's
trimorphic vision of Jesus

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:84%
refers to the father,
mother, and son of God?

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> It is painstakingly obvious
who the servant is in The

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Apocryphon of John.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:19.730 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus reveals the
transmorphic vision to John

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and he tells John, John,
John, why do you doubt

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:90%
or why are you afraid?

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:90%
That is, do not be timid.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I am the one who
was with you always.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I am the father, I am
the mother, I am the son.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.305 align:middle line:90%
So the servant is obvious.

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we consider
that women were

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:84%
the servants in the family in
the old Middle Eastern world

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and that Jesus's
mother, Mary, was

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.370 align:middle line:84%
his first servant
as a child, Jesus

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is speaking that the servant
is actually the mother of God.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.630 align:middle line:90%
The mother of God.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I am the father, I am the
mother, and I am the son.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.280 align:middle line:84%
The first image John seems
is God with a white beard.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Jesus never lived
to be old enough

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:90%
to have the white-gray beard.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that
Jesus is showing John

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:90%
that he is the agent of days.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.030 align:middle line:84%
He is God, the God who
appeared to all the prophets.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And then he appears
as the young man

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:90%
whose beard is just beginning.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And then into the
woman, the servant.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The God is saying something
to John here through Jesus.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that
the image you have

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:84%
of God in the church as a man,
as the male dominant image

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:90%
of God is wrong.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I am showing you that God is
both the father and the mother

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.600 align:middle line:90%
and the son all in one.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:84%
This trimorphic vision,
revelation to John,

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.160 align:middle line:84%
is that the image of God
is feminine and masculine.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> While there is some evidence
in the gospel of Philip that

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Jesus may have been
married to Mary Magdalene,

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:84%
why is it used to attempt to
strip him of His divinity,

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:84%
saying that if he had
had sexual relations,

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:84%
he could not have
been the Son of God?

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.320 align:middle line:84%
All the icons of the great
religions of the world

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:90%
were in divine love pairs.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The name of God in
the Bible is Yahweh.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The secret feminine spirit
of God in mystic Judaism

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:90%
is the Shekhinah.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.180 align:middle line:10%
For the gnostic
Christians, Jesus

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.790 align:middle line:10%
describes in The
Apocryphon of John

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:43.840 align:middle line:10%
the feminine spirit of God
at the earliest creation.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:10%
For the Greeks, the
feminine spirit of God

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.870 align:middle line:10%
was the Sophia of Christ.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.970 align:middle line:84%
In the angelic natural
order, the Seraphim

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:56.690 align:middle line:84%
are the highest residing in
the ninth sphere of heaven.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.600 align:middle line:84%
In the eighth heaven
are the cherubim.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Cupid, a supreme cherub, is
said to have fallen in love with

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.230 align:middle line:90%
and married Psyche.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The prophet of Islam, Muhammad,
took wives, the first of which

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.380 align:middle line:90%
was Khadijah.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Krishna, the supreme
Hindu incarnation

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of God in the highest, had a
female consort named Radha.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Shiva, the Hindu
god of destruction,

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:90%
was in love with Uma.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Princess Yashodhara
and Buddha were

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.730 align:middle line:90%
married at 16 years of age.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:84%
When Yashodhara was 29, she
gave birth to their son, Rahula.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Although Buddha
received blessings

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:middle line:84%
to leave their palace
to seek enlightenment,

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.980 align:middle line:90%
his wife was devastated.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The whole time Yashodara
stripped herself of riches,

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.210 align:middle line:84%
wore the yellow robe,
ate one meal per day,

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.580 align:middle line:90%
and practiced meditation.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:00.080 align:middle line:84%
After six years, he attained
nirvana and returned.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.590 align:middle line:84%
When she saw the awakened
Buddha, she fell at his feet

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and cried until she soaked
his feet in her tears of love.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.410 align:middle line:84%
She entered the order of
Buddha's nuns and attained

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.180 align:middle line:90%
true nirvana.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Their son followed.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Buddha said to his father, not
only this last birth, o' king,

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.160 align:middle line:84%
but in a previous
birth to, Yashodara

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.430 align:middle line:90%
was devoted and faithful to me.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The father of Tibetan Buddhism,
Padmasambhava, the Buddha,

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:37.490 align:middle line:84%
had a female consort
named Yeshe Sogyal.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Did the early Roman church
strip the wisdom of God

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in the feminine,
calling it heresy,

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:84%
so that they could maintain
a male-dominated image of God

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.370 align:middle line:90%
and power?

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:53.180 align:middle line:84%
If Mary Magdalene was
Jesus's divine wife,

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.090 align:middle line:84%
standing beside him from
the time of his ministry

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to his death,
wouldn't it explain

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.810 align:middle line:84%
why he appeared to her
first upon his Resurrection?

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't he want to
comfort her immediately

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.890 align:middle line:84%
so she could rest in peace,
knowing he was alive forever

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and that she would
join him in heaven?

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.070 align:middle line:84%
In the book, "The Little
Flowers of Saint Francis,"

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
it is written that
after refusing

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.330 align:middle line:84%
to have dinner
with Sister Claire,

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Francis accepted
that they would have

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.940 align:middle line:84%
a meal on the ground
outside the church.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Before their first bite,
Francis spoke so sweetly to her

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden,
the spirit of God

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:38.270 align:middle line:84%
enveloped them and the whole
mountain in a fire of light.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.840 align:middle line:84%
People saw the mountain
ablaze from miles away.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.390 align:middle line:84%
When they came upon
the fire, they only

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:50.270 align:middle line:84%
found Francis and Clare,
gazing into each other's eyes.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Is the singularity of love
between man and woman the

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.420 align:middle line:90%
secret to enlightenment?

00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a way to distinguish
between a dream and a vision,

00:50:01.435 --> 00:50:03.810 align:middle line:84%
such as what some
Shamans would have,

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.687 align:middle line:84%
a vision of the
future or a prophesy?

00:50:06.687 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:84%
How do you differentiate
between the two,

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.570 align:middle line:84%
such as when Archangel Gabriel
appeared to Virgin Mary

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to announce Christ's birth?

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a good question,
because the Shamans didn't make

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:middle line:90%
that distinction.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.645 align:middle line:84%
They sort of thought
of visions and dreams

00:50:25.645 --> 00:50:27.930 align:middle line:90%
as much the same thing.

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you go back into the
sacred literature, the story

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of Gabriel, the story of
Enoch, the story of Muhammed,

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:40.360 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, you're not
sure if these were visions

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.400 align:middle line:90%
or if they were dreams.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.505 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, we have the technology
to discriminate the two.

00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Dreams occur while
you're asleep.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Visions occur
while you're awake.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own
special brain waves associated

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.380 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And there have been studies
done of people who have visions.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:01.730 align:middle line:90%
They're wide awake.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.420 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
these theta wave

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I told you about that
characterize imagery.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:84%
They have very unusual
psychophysiological reactions

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.410 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
heart beat rate

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and their pulse, et cetera,
but no, they're not asleep.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, you would say that
visions are intense experiences

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of imagery that carry a lot of
meaning that happen when we're

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.880 align:middle line:84%
awake, while dreams, whether
they have much meaning or not,

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.920 align:middle line:90%
happen when we're asleep.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But back thousands of years ago,
that equipment wasn't around.

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So we'll never know
whether if Mother Mary

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.720 align:middle line:84%
dreamed about the
visitation or was awake

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.750 align:middle line:90%
and saw the visitation.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.990 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> After 15 years of
daily meditation practice,

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:56.270 align:middle line:84%
in the 1990s, David Sereda
experienced three visions

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:58.160 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus Christ.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.830 align:middle line:84%
He was blinded with a glory
of innocence, love, ecstasy,

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:09.850 align:middle line:84%
peace, power, beauty, wisdom
and grace, and with a light

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:15.710 align:middle line:84%
he described brighter
than 1,000 suns.

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Jesus began to
teach David insights

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:90%
into the secret of singularity.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus showed me the true
meaning of the proverbial fall

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.230 align:middle line:84%
from grace in the
Garden of Eden.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.270 align:middle line:84%
By partaking of
the forbidden fruit

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.490 align:middle line:84%
from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil,

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:38.820 align:middle line:84%
we lost singularity, oneness,
and direct access to God.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.560 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what this
knowledge does and we see it

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in its entirety, it is
nothing but a conflict.

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Good and evil radiates conflict.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone feels the inner
conflict all of the time.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It is what causes us to
believe our religion is

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.700 align:middle line:84%
superior to another, our
egoified image of God

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:04.060 align:middle line:84%
is superior to the other,
our country, family, race,

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.740 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:09.040 align:middle line:84%
This inner conflict is a madness
that cannot ever be solved

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.300 align:middle line:90%
by the ego.

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.250 align:middle line:84%
We actually believe our
religion is on God's side

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and the other religion
is the devil or evil.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the trap that binds
us to the polarity matrix.

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.960 align:middle line:84%
We go to war with
others because we do not

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.190 align:middle line:84%
feel the unification and the
truth of God's singularity.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Singularity is the
undivided state

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.130 align:middle line:84%
of heaven filled with
peace, love, and bliss.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Heaven vibrates with the
light of singularity.

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.860 align:middle line:84%
In the conflict
of good and evil,

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.040 align:middle line:84%
duality cannot survive
in singularity,

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.330 align:middle line:84%
just as a conflict cannot
exist in a state of true peace.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.690 align:middle line:84%
By taking on the consciousness
of a polarity matrix,

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.060 align:middle line:90%
we fall from singularity.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:56.590 align:middle line:84%
A vortex of duality forms,
shielding the human soul

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.950 align:middle line:84%
from the singularity's
divinity in the field of light

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:01.870 align:middle line:90%
we call the human aura.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:84%
We can no longer feel
the voice of God.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.130 align:middle line:90%
We are human.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.830 align:middle line:84%
The human aura
appears bright to us,

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but in actuality, the inner
conflict over good and evil

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:84%
devours most of our
spiritual energy,

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.340 align:middle line:84%
leaving us with
a dimly lit bulb.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:10%
Our light is deficient and
so weak it cannot even cause

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.570 align:middle line:10%
a stone to levitate or
a flower to blossom.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.400 align:middle line:10%
That is why we suffer.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.740 align:middle line:10%
That is why we are not
in bliss consciousness.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.270 align:middle line:10%
We are devouring our energy
over the inner conflict.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.760 align:middle line:84%
To become free of
the polarity matrix,

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.030 align:middle line:84%
we must end the inner conflict
and attain singularity.

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:90%


00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:49.420 align:middle line:84%
What happens is all seven
of our aura's energy centers

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.360 align:middle line:84%
go into inner
conflict and consume

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.630 align:middle line:84%
all of their psychic
spiritual energy potential,

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:59.020 align:middle line:84%
leaving very little
energy for us to survive.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.510 align:middle line:84%
In The Apocryphon of
John, Jesus tells us

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that after the fall
from grace, humanity

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:84%
was cast to the lowest
region of all matter.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Not the lowest
geographical region

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, but the
lowest region of matter itself.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.870 align:middle line:10%
>> When you consider the
purification of the mind

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:19.880 align:middle line:10%
and the fact that we only
see from red to violet,

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:23.551 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow spectrum, that
when the mind is much clearer

00:55:23.551 --> 00:55:26.050 align:middle line:10%
in the clear light that you
were saying that in the Buddhist

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:10%
perspective, you can actually
see these invisible layers

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.160 align:middle line:10%
or strata.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> You can see quarks.

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.700 align:middle line:90%
You can see subatomic energies.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see the level of
pure mind or pure energy.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we look
at what matter is--

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:47.620 align:middle line:84%
matter, flesh, atomic structures
are made of polarity matrices.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.000 align:middle line:84%
When we consider the
experiments on water,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is the authority

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:54.190 align:middle line:84%
over atomic
structures and matter,

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:58.060 align:middle line:84%
it is no coincidence that
all subatomic particles

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.670 align:middle line:84%
have the polarity
matrix code on them.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:03.970 align:middle line:10%
All the subatomic particles,
from the proton, anti-proton,

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:10%
electron, anti-electron, muon,
anti-muon, tau, anti-taus,

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.910 align:middle line:10%
quarks, anti-quarks, all
of the subatomic particles

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.420 align:middle line:10%
are trapped in the
polarity matrix.

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.820 align:middle line:10%
They are in duality
because we are

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.520 align:middle line:10%
telling them to be that
way on a deep subconscious

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.200 align:middle line:10%
level of our consciousness.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The atom is a perfect reflection
of our inner knowledge

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:28.272 align:middle line:90%
of good and evil.

00:56:28.272 --> 00:56:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens is, when
individually we take

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:35.450 align:middle line:84%
in the knowledge of good and
evil, we become a conflict.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:39.630 align:middle line:10%
We go from a consciousness
of a field of singularity,

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.780 align:middle line:10%
of oneness, and
light, and we become

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:46.640 align:middle line:10%
divided into the polarity
matrix of good and evil.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.820 align:middle line:10%
And when 6 and 1/2
billion souls take

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.450 align:middle line:10%
in the knowledge
of good and evil,

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:53.600 align:middle line:10%
the problem is we all identify
things as good and evil

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.670 align:middle line:10%
differently than each other.

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We see our same religion
differently than our neighbor

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.440 align:middle line:90%
inside of the religion.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:05.720 align:middle line:10%
We argue inside of the
religion, and we become divided.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.190 align:middle line:10%
We put up walls.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.489 align:middle line:10%
We have different sects
of the same religion.

00:57:09.489 --> 00:57:11.030 align:middle line:10%
And then one religion
starts fighting

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:13.940 align:middle line:10%
against another religion because
the knowledge of good or evil

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.810 align:middle line:10%
causes us to
believe our religion

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:21.770 align:middle line:10%
or our anti-religion is more
superior than the other.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate end
game to having partaken

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.890 align:middle line:84%
in the knowledge of good
and evil is to go to war

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and to waste all
of our resources

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.630 align:middle line:84%
economically, to waste
all of our energy,

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and go to war to
conquer the other,

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:38.060 align:middle line:84%
to say that we are
better than the other.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.860 align:middle line:90%
We are more superior.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.700 align:middle line:84%
We do this in all sorts of
ways, by populating territories,

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.700 align:middle line:84%
taking over territories
by overpopulating,

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:51.710 align:middle line:84%
making bombs, the atomic
bomb, wars, genocide.

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:52.730 align:middle line:90%
All of it is committed.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:57.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even Mao Tze Tung,
Chairman Mao of China,

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.660 align:middle line:84%
took over Tibet not because
he had a better religion,

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.830 align:middle line:90%
because he was against religion.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.150 align:middle line:84%
He was the antithesis
to Buddhism.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the madness of
the knowledge of good and evil.

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It's vibrating
internally inside of us.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:14.690 align:middle line:84%
All seven of our energy
centers are in this conflict.

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And the conflict is wasting
all of our energy, all

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.830 align:middle line:90%
of our psychic energy.

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we can end the conflict,
if we can become single,

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:26.210 align:middle line:84%
we can attain true
peace as individuals.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, one light
bulb at a time,

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:32.920 align:middle line:84%
we can attain singularity
and peace as a civilization.

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And we could end war with
the power of this knowledge.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the great mystics
had to encounter the demonic

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:41.840 align:middle line:90%
or dark forces.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.460 align:middle line:10%
What is evil?

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.640 align:middle line:10%
When the first fallen angels
went from singularity's field

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.900 align:middle line:10%
of non-dual love and embodied
the knowledge of good and evil,

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:55.340 align:middle line:10%
they became the force
of pure conflict itself.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:59.930 align:middle line:84%
A conflict cannot exist
in a field of singularity

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because singularity's field
is a non-dual field of peace

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The energy of duality
falls out of singularity

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:13.100 align:middle line:84%
on its own accord by the
very nature of the knowledge

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.630 align:middle line:90%
of good and evil.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Dark forces try to engage
us in the energy of conflict

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and fear itself because
that is what they represent.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.300 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that when
a person or persons become

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.800 align:middle line:84%
supremely arrogant about
their version of good and evil

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and opposes another body of
thought, religion, country,

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:39.470 align:middle line:84%
politician, or any
antithesis, this force

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:42.350 align:middle line:84%
can produce acts of
violence to get their way

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:47.660 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill their idea by
going to war and taking lives.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Genocide is the end game.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Evil is live spelled backwards.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Evil is the force that corrupts,
destroys, and takes life.

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.730 align:middle line:84%
At the subatomic level,
the polarity matrix

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:07.310 align:middle line:84%
is the root cause of why we
suffer and why we go to war.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:10.280 align:middle line:84%
If we could end it, we
could end our experience

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.350 align:middle line:90%
of suffering itself.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The polarity matrix is the
root cause of why matter cannot

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
travel at the speed
of light and beyond.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.590 align:middle line:84%
It is the cause of cellular
aging, disease, and death.

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
If we could break the duality
code with singularity,

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:29.870 align:middle line:90%
we could attain immortality.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:35.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.050 align:middle line:10%
Paul Dirac, a Nobel
Prize winner in physics,

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:42.290 align:middle line:10%
discovered a substratum
to our universe

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:45.470 align:middle line:10%
that was, in fact,
singularity, where

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:50.690 align:middle line:10%
none of the subatomic particles,
bound in duality, could enter.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
He found all matter was
born from gamma rays

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
radiating out of
the non-dual sea

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and eventually decaying
and returning into it.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
The field Dirac discovered
behaved precisely in accordance

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
to the non-dual teachings of
Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism,

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and Christianity.

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Dirac found if you could make a
subatomic particle wave at one

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.840 align:middle line:84%
with the field of non-duality,
the particle wave could then

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.630 align:middle line:84%
enter the field and travel
any distance instantaneously,

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
circumventing the
speed of light limit.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It was the perfect resolution
to Einstein's spooky action

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.550 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
As the water experiments prove,
consciousness, information,

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
is the authority over matter.

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.830 align:middle line:90%
It can tell it what to do.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
When we end the inner
conflict perpetuated

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
by the knowledge
of good and evil,

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
one energy center at
a time, we no longer

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
waste our spiritual
energy on the conflict,

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and we attain true peace.

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
This peace becomes so profound
our spiritual body becomes

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
filled with the true light of
love, bliss, ecstasy, peace,

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
power, beauty, wisdom,
and grace unimaginable.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
The aura starts to expand
beyond the small spheres

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:20.850 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the body and
explodes into the nine greater

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
spheres or rings of
true enlightenment,

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.220 align:middle line:84%
into the solar system
and the cosmos beyond.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%


01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
There are four major
stages of enlightenment.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
One entails several
stages of concentration.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.162 align:middle line:84%
Two entails several
stages of meditation.

01:02:43.162 --> 01:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, if you keep anger or
pain, you never go to heavenly,

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:50.846 align:middle line:90%
heavenly, upward.

01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:55.490 align:middle line:10%
The point is gradual
depends on memory of pain

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:59.500 align:middle line:10%
and those things
are not important.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Go to heaven is important.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.142 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] peace, and
comfort is important.

01:03:07.142 --> 01:03:09.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Constant forgiveness?

01:03:09.264 --> 01:03:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Forgive?

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Not forgiveness.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Forget everything.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
That is important.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you never
gain peace of mind.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.792 align:middle line:84%
>> --that feels when you go
into that super refined state,

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like your
body feels so gentle.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.242 align:middle line:10%
You can't stop smiling
when you come out it.

01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:39.400 align:middle line:10%
While you're in it, it's just
a feeling of complete light.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.920 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you get different
visions and things like that.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.400 align:middle line:10%
A lot of information can
come through sometimes.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.672 align:middle line:10%
Usually, after I come out of
a deep meditation like that,

01:03:49.672 --> 01:03:51.180 align:middle line:10%
like I'll be walking around.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel very, very
gentle in my body.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Very, very open and loving.

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Like to strangers, I
just want to hug them.

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Very, very peaceful.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Can't stop smiling.

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I can really just feel like
it's a real gentle energy.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Third is the attainment
of six stages of samadhi,

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:19.030 align:middle line:84%
clear light heavens, or
superluminal spheres or rings

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:20.407 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:04:20.407 --> 01:04:25.177 align:middle line:90%


01:04:25.177 --> 01:04:28.306 align:middle line:84%
>> An artist is dependent
on his expression,

01:04:28.306 --> 01:04:30.290 align:middle line:90%
his or her expression.

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:35.100 align:middle line:10%
Here again samadhi
makes a profound impact

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:39.110 align:middle line:10%
on your ability to express.

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:45.960 align:middle line:10%
Art is a way to express
the inexpressible.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And samadhi shares
the same value.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So mediation and
samadhi helps an artist

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
because it brings a
newness to the expression.

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:02.600 align:middle line:90%


01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, for common man,
everyone wants to be happy.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't want to be happy?

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And that happiness
is of a very nature.

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.375 align:middle line:90%
It is deep within us.

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So meditation and
samadhi helps you

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:23.536 align:middle line:84%
to uncover the divinity,
the happiness, the joy

01:05:23.536 --> 01:05:25.508 align:middle line:90%
that we're all made up of.

01:05:25.508 --> 01:05:28.470 align:middle line:90%


01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I woke up one morning and
I discovered that I had 360

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
degree vision.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was, again, it was
very difficult to handle.

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I immediately got
on the phone, and I

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:46.440 align:middle line:90%
started calling the hospital.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I got a hold of
some psychiatrist.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd completely lost my
mind and I was imagining this.

01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:55.884 align:middle line:84%
But I quickly learned
that they didn't know how

01:05:55.884 --> 01:05:57.050 align:middle line:90%
to handle what I was saying.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:58.508 align:middle line:84%
They thought I'd
just lost my mind.

01:05:58.508 --> 01:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't true.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I was just simply seeing
the world in 360 degrees.

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't having any
enlightened feelings

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
about life or any elated
feeling or spiritual feeling,

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.660 align:middle line:90%
whatever that might be.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:19.268 align:middle line:84%
I was simply just seeing
the world in 360 degrees.

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter
if I closed my eyes.

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.780 align:middle line:90%
That had no effect.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything was still coming
in from every vantage point.

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
was kind of interesting,

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:35.286 align:middle line:84%
with your normal vision, you
seem to look around the room

01:06:35.286 --> 01:06:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and you look at different
points of interest.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.368 align:middle line:84%
Like you would see an earring
that a woman's wearing.

01:06:39.368 --> 01:06:41.095 align:middle line:84%
You would think,
oh, that's a pearl.

01:06:41.095 --> 01:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you look to the
other side of the room

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.570 align:middle line:84%
you might see a
bottle, you might say,

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
there's a checkered pattern
there, and whatever it is.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But with this
experience, everything

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
was coming in with
total clarity.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was fully conscious of
every fragment of every surface

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of everything that was around.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.386 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't say now I'm
looking over here or looking

01:07:04.386 --> 01:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
there, shifting my attention
to this point or that point.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It was simply all coming in
all at once in 360 degrees.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:21.430 align:middle line:90%


01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Some years ago,
about 10 years ago,

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
my friend Charles Overby
was coming to the lab,

01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
visiting in Princeton and
helping us think about various

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:34.630 align:middle line:90%
things in the laboratory.

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:38.020 align:middle line:10%
And he himself had become
very much interested

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.510 align:middle line:10%
in the idea of
photographing what I think

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:43.000 align:middle line:10%
most people would call an aura.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.030 align:middle line:90%
We set up a dark, dark room.

01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
We blocked all the light,
and then set the camera

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.200 align:middle line:90%
to take pictures of a person--

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and in this particular case
it was Charles himself--

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.970 align:middle line:90%
meditating.

01:07:57.970 --> 01:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So the camera was
aimed at Charles' head.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:08.640 align:middle line:10%
And the picture of the result
from this particular occasion

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.970 align:middle line:10%
is a truly amazing,
almost unbelievable

01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:16.300 align:middle line:10%
and almost certainly
unique photograph

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.130 align:middle line:10%
of what appears to be a
kind of either radiation

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:25.029 align:middle line:10%
out from or acceptance
into the crown

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:27.939 align:middle line:10%
chakra of ultraviolet light.

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:33.189 align:middle line:84%
You can see the outline of
Charles' head and hairline.

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
kind of funnel shape

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
that's three dimensional.

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.859 align:middle line:90%
You can see into it.

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You can more or less see
a spiraling structure.

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:52.840 align:middle line:10%
And this picture, to me, is a
truly remarkable confirmation

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.340 align:middle line:10%
that there is something
like the aura, that

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.930 align:middle line:10%
given the right
kind of technology

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.950 align:middle line:10%
and a very strong desire
and a lot of patience,

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:04.359 align:middle line:10%
can actually be captured.

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> From the scientific
evidence we've seen,

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
photographing the human aura
in the ultraviolet at the crown

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.250 align:middle line:84%
chakra, the top of the head, the
human aura appears to connect

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to a funnel that expands
out into the cosmos.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.824 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
how far does it extend?

01:09:22.824 --> 01:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%


01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.859 align:middle line:10%
We have explored how the
auras of subatomic particles

01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:32.859 align:middle line:10%
expand and share
their information

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:37.990 align:middle line:10%
with the auras of
atoms to DNA to humans,

01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:41.920 align:middle line:10%
who extend their auras to
the aura of the Earth itself.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we will see how the
human aura can potentially

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
expand into the auras
of cosmic proportions.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there a heaven?

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.750 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a core question
that just about everybody

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.860 align:middle line:10%
has asked themselves
at one time or another.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.292 align:middle line:10%
And many, many people
have struggled with that.

01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:01.750 align:middle line:10%
Can I really believe
that I'm going

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:04.120 align:middle line:10%
to go on living after I die?

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.250 align:middle line:84%
What about my loved
ones that die?

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to be OK?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
be in some type

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
of a paradise, some
type of other existence

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.935 align:middle line:90%
that could be called Heaven?

01:10:13.935 --> 01:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the
near-death experience

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
data, at least to
me, is absolutely

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
convincing on this point.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
in my mind, based

01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
on the review of 1,400
near-death experiences,

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness
absolutely

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
does survive bodily death.

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:30.680 align:middle line:90%
We go on living.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We're actually who we are on
Earth only much, much more.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Much, much interconnected.

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And the realms that
people describe,

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the existence that
people describes

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is what I think would meet
the definition of anybody

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
a heaven is, only

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
it's much, much more,
much, grander, much more

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.200 align:middle line:90%
dramatic and certainly eternal.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think the near-death
experience, again, at least

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
to me, very convincing
on that point.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> On November 22 and 23 1986 I
had the most powerful spiritual

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
experience of my life.

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I had been practicing
meditation vigorously, sometimes

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
four and six hours a day, two,
three hours a day for seven

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:15.670 align:middle line:90%
years at this point of my life.

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea it
was about to happen.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.500 align:middle line:10%
But in the afternoon in Canada,
at about 4:15 in the afternoon,

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.120 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I was dying.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was so heavy.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.260 align:middle line:10%
And this force
just came over me.

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.880 align:middle line:10%
Just knocked me senseless.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.720 align:middle line:10%
And I lied down in my bedroom.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And almost instantaneously
I was in this vision

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in this poor house in
the middle of the desert.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.090 align:middle line:90%
The oldest, oldest house.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was an old man
dying on a bed with two women

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
in white praying over his body.

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And he looked like he was dead.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.570 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden this man
got up and he said to me,

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:55.750 align:middle line:10%
do you want to see an angel?

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:56.791 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my god.

01:11:56.791 --> 01:11:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I thought you were dead.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do you
want to see an angel?

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.440 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:07.410 align:middle line:10%
And the second I said, yes,
like thunder, white light

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.520 align:middle line:10%
was pouring down from above.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Dissolved the entire
vision of the house.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
thunderous pulsing wind,

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.100 align:middle line:90%
like an earthquake of wind.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And angels voices
singing like vortexes

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and spinning those
beautiful music.

01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Any human being would go deaf
if they heard this music.

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:29.530 align:middle line:90%
It was the voice of God.

01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
The voice of God was in these
angels, and it was so bright.

01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:35.980 align:middle line:90%
And there was nothing but fear.

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.540 align:middle line:90%
There was no love.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.860 align:middle line:90%
There was no ecstasy.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It was just terror
for how powerful.

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was in the
presence of God, God's self.

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
started to feel so much love.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.600 align:middle line:90%
The love is what was killing me.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The love was so powerful
I couldn't bear it.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It was causing me
to be paralyzed.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.210 align:middle line:90%
My legs became paralyzed.

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:56.540 align:middle line:90%
My arms became paralyzed.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
My spine, and then my neck.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And the angels' singing was
so beautiful, unimaginably

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, I just knew that
this was the voice of God,

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that I could trust, despite
the fear, the tremendous fear,

01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:15.286 align:middle line:84%
and the deafening sound, and
the paralysis of my body.

01:13:15.286 --> 01:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And I just surrendered.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
surrendered, within seconds,

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:23.110 align:middle line:90%
this huge explosion of ecstasy.

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It was like supernovas.

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:26.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not kidding.

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Bigger than an entire stellar
constellation of light.

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
This just massive explosion
of light came from within me.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much ecstasy
and love and peace and beauty

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and qualities that were
unnameable, exploding

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:45.390 align:middle line:90%
from inside of this light.

01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was carried upwards.

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Like a mother carrying
a baby in her arms,

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I was carried upwards above
the city, above the Earth,

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and I saw my past lives.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I saw a
sea of 100,000 or more souls

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
in silvery gray fields
that looked like cocoons.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.020 align:middle line:90%
The shape of the human aura.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And an angel of light
came off to my left

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and told me that these were
souls that had passed away.

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And you could see little
lights flickering inside

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.740 align:middle line:90%
of their spheres.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And the light were their
thoughts, just like right now.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
If I think an
apple or an orange,

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing it on the
screen of my mind.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.380 align:middle line:90%
I could see them thinking.

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, I could
see that the vortex

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge
of good and evil

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:35.290 align:middle line:84%
was creating the force field
of the cocoon around them.

01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't free.

01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And above them was this
supernatural light.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.347 align:middle line:84%
And I came over to some of
them, and I wanted to free them.

01:14:43.347 --> 01:14:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say,
hey, wake up, there's

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
light on the other side
of this if you just

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:50.020 align:middle line:84%
crack the egg open,
if you can get

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.570 align:middle line:90%
past the fear and the shaking.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And none of them could do it.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:56.800 align:middle line:84%
The angel told me that
there's nothing I could do.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.540 align:middle line:90%
None of them were ready yet.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, I just left.

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I left Earth, and
I started zooming

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
what appeared to be through
space and the galaxy.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down at my body
and it was completely human.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But it was so ultra-human
that if I used my hand

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and closed my eye, I
could see like a telescope

01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
through my fingertips.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I could see and hear
the music of the angels

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.990 align:middle line:90%
through every pore of my being.

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Eyesight was not
limited to the eyes.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
It was happening
from everywhere.

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I could see behind me,
underneath me, above me,

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.350 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was zooming at
superluminal speeds,

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
thousands of times faster
than the speed of light

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.120 align:middle line:90%
through the galaxy.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And as I was moving through
this first celestial heaven

01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of clear light
enlightenment, the light

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:46.550 align:middle line:84%
itself told me that
there were millions

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:49.352 align:middle line:84%
of paradise planets suspended
in this field of light.

01:15:49.352 --> 01:15:51.345 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't stop
on any of them.

01:15:51.345 --> 01:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the point where
I came to this membrane.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.000 align:middle line:90%
You could actually see it.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And the closer I got to it,
the ecstasy and the love

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.750 align:middle line:90%
was crushing me.

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It was so overwhelming.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It was more than I ever
dreamed enlightenment

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.980 align:middle line:90%
to be its very self.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these
years and meditation,

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and this was way more ecstasy
and love than I ever, ever

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
dreamed how grand this
realization could be.

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I approached
the membrane,

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I became so crushed with
ecstasy it was unbearable.

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Imagine too much love.

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It's so much love that
you can't bear it.

01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went through the membrane
into the second clear light

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.500 align:middle line:90%
heaven.

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
In the second clear light
heaven, everything, the love,

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.600 align:middle line:84%
the ecstasy, the
peace, the power,

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
the beauty multiplied
another million times.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's exponential.

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But miraculously, the
new body that I possessed

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
in the second heaven
of clear light

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
was able to sustain it
without being crushed.

01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And there I was, and my
field was at least 30 feet

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:54.890 align:middle line:90%
beyond my body.

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:56.420 align:middle line:90%
I still had arms and legs.

01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was zooming through the
universe at superluminal speed.

01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And the angels' singing
was louder, more beautiful.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I can hear it more clearly.

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.830 align:middle line:84%
You could see
vortexes coming out

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of the voices of
the angels, causing

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.140 align:middle line:84%
the planets and the stars
and the solar systems

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and the galaxies to be spinning.

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And the subatomic particles,
you could see all of it

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.850 align:middle line:84%
was caused by the
voices of angels.

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:23.930 align:middle line:84%
They weren't just singing for
the beauty of God's choir.

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
They were singing to create
and sustain the creation.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It was very clear in this
omniscient knowledge.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I again
came to a membrane,

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and the ecstasy started
crushing me torrentially.

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I went through the second
membrane into the third heaven.

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the third
heaven, it multiplies

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
another million times.

01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It's billions of
times greater than I

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
thought enlightenment itself
would ever be at this point.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's inconceivable
to the human brain

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
how much ecstasy God
has in store for us.

01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just felt like
this is our birthright.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:03.180 align:middle line:90%
We all deserve this.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And my body was at least
100 feet wide in the light,

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
but I still had arms
and legs and hands.

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
I was a divine human form.

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, not
even a millimeter

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:17.850 align:middle line:90%
of suffering anywhere.

01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at this point,
I started to doubt

01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
all enlightened masters
on Earth because I

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't think that
anybody could function

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
in this much supreme love
and ecstasy and peace.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And the cosmic mind,
the sphere of my aura

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
was merging into the entire
universe, the galaxy.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It was just so
heavy and massive.

01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Who can walk around like this?

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I came to the membrane
between the third and fourth.

01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And again, I was crushed.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It was unbearable, all of the
qualities of God in the light.

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And I went into the fourth.

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth, to me,
it was the beginning

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of the unspeakable.

01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I had no arms and legs.

01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:59.180 align:middle line:90%
No body.

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I became a field of light that
was many, many light years

01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.790 align:middle line:90%
across.

01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, enormous in size.

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
My body that I was was
light years across.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I approached
the edge of the fourth

01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth, the exponential
increases in God's glory,

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.080 align:middle line:90%
they become unspeakable.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
It is unimaginable to a
human mind what is going

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.550 align:middle line:90%
on inside of these fields.

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The fields themselves
are conscious.

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.020 align:middle line:90%
They are alive.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.000 align:middle line:90%
They always existed.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I egotistically
became as big as the field

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:37.940 align:middle line:90%
as if I projected out.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
These fields have
always existed.

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we become one with
these rings, these spheres

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, we get access
to everything the field knows,

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.331 align:middle line:90%
which is universal.

01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
If you were Einstein,
you could understand

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the physics and the vortices and
the vast knowledge of creation.

01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
If you were da Vinci, you
could understand painting

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.090 align:middle line:90%
beyond all dimensions.

01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you were Beethoven,
the music of the spheres,

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
if you could write it down, if
I could have written that down,

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I would have created
symphonies beyond symphonies

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
for what I heard.

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And then I went into the fifth.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
edge of the fifth,

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I went into the sixth.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It is simply unimaginable what
is happening in the sixth.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.230 align:middle line:90%
It is inconceivable.

01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:27.660 align:middle line:90%
There is no sense of self.

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be
completely extinguished.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
There is no more David.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
David the little man disappeared
into the Big Sky and was gone.

01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There was no trace
of him anymore.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.450 align:middle line:90%
It was just God.

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:42.900 align:middle line:90%
The entire universe was my body.

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I approached
the edge of the seventh,

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the edge of the
seventh came and I

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
knew that if I
crossed that point,

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
something was going to
happen that was so massive,

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
so beyond my
abilities, that I felt

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
that my physical body would
terminate on the ground below,

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't be
able to come back

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.960 align:middle line:84%
to tell people that the
Kingdom of Heaven is real.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
The desire to come
back was stronger

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.094 align:middle line:84%
than the desire to
cross to find out

01:21:12.094 --> 01:21:13.260 align:middle line:90%
what was beyond the seventh.

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:27.440 align:middle line:90%


01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In the "Lankavatara Sutra,"
it is written that Buddha

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
attained up to the sixth
samadhi over 400 lifetimes.

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Buddha said that all the
samadhis up to the sixth

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:40.180 align:middle line:90%
are impermanent.

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Many attain some of them
thinking they are in nirvana

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.210 align:middle line:90%
but remain deluded.

01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
The nirvana of the
Tathagatas, full Buddhas,

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.270 align:middle line:90%
begins at the seventh.

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Nirvana for the Bodhisattva
is beyond the sixth,

01:21:56.530 --> 01:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
into the seventh,
and beyond the ninth.

01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
In order to go
beyond the sixth, one

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:07.390 align:middle line:84%
has to come out of the
extreme ecstasy of this state

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and do something
to uplift humanity.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, one can gain
the grace they

01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
need to enter the
seventh and beyond.

01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There are the seven levels
of samadhi in the "Lankavatara

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Sutra," but he mentions the
self-absorbed bliss states

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
where you can get trapped in
these bliss clouds and luminous

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.650 align:middle line:90%
spheres for millions of years.

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:30.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not nirvana.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.800 align:middle line:90%
You're still in a more--

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It's still a limited,
self-centered bliss.

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not the what's called the
bliss void indivisible or bliss

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.540 align:middle line:90%
freedom indivisible.

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not the inconceivable,
ultimate bliss.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:49.270 align:middle line:90%


01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And fourth is three known
spheres or rings of nirvana,

01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.050 align:middle line:90%
God realization.

01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
These stages are
documented and most common

01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
to most of the major
world religions,

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:05.831 align:middle line:84%
although they are expressed in
different languages or symbols.

01:23:05.831 --> 01:23:09.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Do the highest jnanas make--

01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:12.112 align:middle line:10%
are they so
transcendent of the body

01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.576 align:middle line:10%
that I wouldn't
even feel something

01:23:13.576 --> 01:23:15.040 align:middle line:10%
going through my foot?

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:20.300 align:middle line:10%
Actually, I don't know
in our daily life,

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:27.242 align:middle line:10%
but certainly in meditation we
can go beyond the sensation.

01:23:27.242 --> 01:23:31.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond even a
painful sensation?

01:23:31.194 --> 01:23:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That is higher jnana.

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Higher jnana.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I have heard.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If you go higher,
you don't feel nothing.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.593 align:middle line:84%
>> So if Jesus had
the nails in his body,

01:23:44.593 --> 01:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
he didn't feel anything if
he was in the highest jnana?

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But even further
in the Acts of John,

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.460 align:middle line:84%
banned by Pope Leo the Great,
is yet another mystery.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
During his own
crucifixion, Jesus Christ

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
reveals something that is an
utter iconoclasm to the church

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and is further evidence as
to why Pope Leo the Great

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:12.120 align:middle line:84%
ordered the gospel to be
burned and banned for all time.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Upon Jesus's arrest
in this gospel,

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is dancing madly in a
circle with his disciples,

01:24:19.190 --> 01:24:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and his disciples are
all spinning around him,

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and he's in the center.

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling them to
dance and to celebrate

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:29.790 align:middle line:84%
the moment of death and not to
fear death and fear the flesh,

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:30.840 align:middle line:90%
but to celebrate.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's not Jesus
who is doubting

01:24:33.450 --> 01:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of his
arrest in the Acts of John,

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
it's the disciples
who are gloomy.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.120 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to dance.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
They are terrified for
the loss of their master.

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus says, dance,
dance in this circle.

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And he chants this
most beautiful prayer

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Acts of John.

01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And then Jesus gets arrested.

01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:53.690 align:middle line:90%
He is tortured and crucified.

01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And as he's being crucified,
John cannot bear to watch

01:24:57.450 --> 01:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
the gruesome torture of
Jesus Christ on the cross.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And he cries and he
runs into the cave

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
on the Mount of Olives
and hides in the cage,

01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
shaking, from all
the other disciples.

01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus appears as a cross
of light inside the cave,

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.510 align:middle line:10%
while simultaneously he's
being crucified below.

01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:21.420 align:middle line:10%
And he says, John,
John, do not doubt.

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't you remember, John, what
I told you about the dance?

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I am suffering none of the
things they will say of me.

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:32.330 align:middle line:84%
That is a wooden
cross and just a body

01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:33.840 align:middle line:90%
on a wooden cross down below.

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I am transcendent of the flesh.

01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Jesus reveals to
John that he is God.

01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:40.425 align:middle line:90%
God is the whole universe.

01:25:40.425 --> 01:25:43.290 align:middle line:10%
You think that this
entire universal state

01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:47.250 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness is limited to
this little body on the cross.

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It was humanity who suffered
on the cross that day

01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
because this is how we
treat the Son of God.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.120 align:middle line:90%
This is how we treat each other.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus is saying,
John, I am not suffering.

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I am celebrating right now.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I am beyond the body,
beyond the flesh.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> In the book, "The
G.O.D Experiments,"

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I take the reader through
a whole host of scientific

01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:14.220 align:middle line:84%
evidence, all of which that
point to the direction that you

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
cannot explain the universe as
a random collection of laws,

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that even randomness
itself is now what we think

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.960 align:middle line:84%
of as randomness, that
there is much greater order

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and complexity,
and if you would,

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the invisible hand of some sort
of guiding designing process

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.440 align:middle line:90%
that plays a role in our lives.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
discover this objectively

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.210 align:middle line:90%
through synchronicity research.

01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:39.720 align:middle line:84%
That is, keeping track of
the patterns that occur.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in Buddha's life, in
all of Buddha's chronicles

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and Buddha himself, he met
the creator God Brahma.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.540 align:middle line:84%
There's even an account
where he met Brahma

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
before he was a Buddha and
asked him, was he the creator,

01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and if so, how does
the world work?

01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
At which point Brahma was forced
to admit he wasn't the creator.

01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:58.600 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't quite sure.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But he was taken for a creator
by a lot of other people,

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.360 align:middle line:90%
including other gods.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of let that
reputation go out there.

01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But really, he
wasn't responsible.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And really, he didn't want
people to believe that.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, the problem
with people believing

01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
in an omnipotent creator is that
people are always ambivalent,

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and they can get, oh, I
love you, I adore you.

01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But they also hate that creator,
because when they suffer,

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
when they lose
their children, when

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
they have horrible
leprosies and things,

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.090 align:middle line:90%
they really resent that creator.

01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
If they think someone
omnipotently did this to them,

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.850 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
dislike that being.

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:38.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of unkind.

01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what Brahma tells
Buddha, before he's Buddha,

01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:42.690 align:middle line:90%
when they have the meeting.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
He says, look, when
you get to be Buddha

01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and you do know how the world
works, please tell people

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't create
their suffering.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.480 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't do that to them.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I am very creative.

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:54.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm powerful.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But I can't create their
suffering and their pleasure.

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It's their own actions that
create their suffering.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:00.990 align:middle line:90%
We're in it together.

01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We all have our
own responsibility.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not to blame for when
really evil things befall them.

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm very sorry about it.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The issue of God, as
encountered by near-death

01:28:10.650 --> 01:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
experiencers, and including
near-death experiencers all

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.500 align:middle line:84%
around the world and from a
variety of different religious

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.860 align:middle line:84%
backgrounds, is
absolutely fascinating.

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, from all the
near-death experience accounts

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.780 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten
over all these years,

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be
a fairly striking

01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:29.261 align:middle line:84%
consistent understanding
about what God is.

01:28:29.261 --> 01:28:30.885 align:middle line:84%
Now, certainly,
there's some diversity,

01:28:30.885 --> 01:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and no two near-death
experiences are the same.

01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But over the 1,400 near-death
experiences we've reviewed,

01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
a fairly consistent
theme is, and perhaps

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.330 align:middle line:90%
most importantly, God is.

01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
There absolutely
is a supreme being

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and is described as being
supremely infinitely

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
intelligent and supremely
and infinitely loving.

What we hear over and over
from near-death experiences

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
is very often
they'll approach God.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll even
seem to be merging or feel

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.820 align:middle line:90%
that they're a part of God.

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Very typically, a near-death
experiencer will say,

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.600 align:middle line:90%
now I get it.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I understand as a result of
my near-death experience.

01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:13.340 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of God, and God
is all part of us, but in a way

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that they could not have
possibly known if they

01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:16.980 align:middle line:90%
didn't have this experience.

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a profound
revelation to them

01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
connected and interacted

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and be loved by God, but
in a way beyond what they

01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:29.910 align:middle line:90%
could have possibly imagined.

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:33.184 align:middle line:84%
It's incredibly comforting
to people to understand that.

01:29:33.184 --> 01:29:35.100 align:middle line:84%
People that have doubted
the existence of God,

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.937 align:middle line:84%
agnostics, atheists,
didn't really sure,

01:29:37.937 --> 01:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
didn't really know that
there could possibly

01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:43.250 align:middle line:84%
be a loving God with all the
evil and turmoil in this world.

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet time and time again
from their experience, often God

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.650 align:middle line:84%
is described as an
entity of light,

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
not really necessary
a physical being.

01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But over and over,
that characteristic

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
of intense, overwhelming love,
intense, overwhelming light,

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and just fantastic
infinite knowledge.

01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Very, very reassuring,
at least to me

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
personally as I've
heard that over and over

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.120 align:middle line:84%
from near-death
experiencers, that's

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
really a God that I
would certainly be

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.150 align:middle line:90%
delightful rules the universe.

01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I've come to the
conclusion, as a scientist,

01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is that when you look at the
totality of the evidence,

01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
it speaks very strongly to the
idea of a deity organizing,

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
designing process
in the universe.

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:37.050 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be
intelligent enough to see it.

>> Enoch was the first biblical
prophet to pierce the seventh

Moses was the only
one among the Jews

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:49.310 align:middle line:84%
who could bear the sight
of God on Mount Sinai.

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
When Krishna transfigured
into a light of thousands

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.200 align:middle line:90%
of suns, who could gaze?

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
If Jesus, as the
Son of God, revealed

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the totality of the
God force to humanity,

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:04.490 align:middle line:90%
who could perceive it?

01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:06.920 align:middle line:84%
If none of his disciples
could bear the glory

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.010 align:middle line:84%
during the
transfigurations, what human

01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:16.310 align:middle line:84%
could see all of God manifest
in the human form all at once?

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:17.960 align:middle line:90%
No one.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Muhammad begged God to see
the heavens beyond the seventh

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.340 align:middle line:84%
but waited humbly
until he was ready.

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
While visiting the
heavens beyond the ninth,

01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
not even Dante Alighieri could
gaze for more than a minute

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
at the absolute vision
of God in his totality.

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:40.880 align:middle line:84%
If no one can
survive a total gaze

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
at the absoluteness
of God, then why

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.370 align:middle line:90%
are we going to war over it?

01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
If no man, woman,
or living being can

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
perceive God in
totality, then who

01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:56.780 align:middle line:90%
has the right to argue for God?

01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.750 align:middle line:84%
We should all be
forever humbled,

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:05.660 align:middle line:84%

what God has to offer humanity.
