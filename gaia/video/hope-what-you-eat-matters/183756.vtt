was heaviness in my

of the cause.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Intensive research led
him to the conclusion

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
our cardiovascular diseases are
caused by our eating habits.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at this
cause of heart disease,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
let's not be confused to blame
it on genes or just blame it

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
on somebody's age or blame
it on the luck of the draw.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is a
foodborne illness,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and we now know that every
time certain foods will

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
pass your lips, you will
further endanger and injure

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
the endothelial cell capacity
to make nitric oxide.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Endothelial cells are crucial
to our blood vessels and heart.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
They line our blood
vessels and produce

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:90%
protective nitric oxide.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And nitric oxide has these
marvelous functions of keeping

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:90%
your blood flowing smoothly.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the strongest
vasodilator in the body.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It also protects you
from getting hypertension

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because it keeps your artery
wall from getting stiff,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
inflamed, or thickened.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, a
plentiful, normal amount

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
of nitric oxide will
prevent you from ever

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:90%
developing blockages or plaque.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists know that
cardiovascular disease starts

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:84%
with progressive damage
to the endothelial cells.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely where
our diets come in.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The excessive consumption of
animal-based or processed foods

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:90%
damages our endothelial cells.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Regular consumption
of these products

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:84%
increasingly diminishes the
protective nitric oxide supply

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.375 align:middle line:90%
in our blood vessels.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
This leads to inflammation
and a hardening and narrowing

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:90%
of the blood vessels.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
These can have life-threatening
consequences, like heart attack

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.826 align:middle line:84%
or stroke, or cause
arteriosclerosis.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:53.216 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:56.192 align:middle line:84%
>> This is just trying to
demonstrate for you that once

00:08:56.192 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:90%
you get this inflammatory--

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Years of research and
personal experience have

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
provided Dr. Esselstyn with
conclusive evidence that

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
a plant-based diet cannot
only prevent the progression

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.026 align:middle line:84%
of heart disease but can
also reverse its effects.

00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing
is on the right--

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Esselstyn has successfully
treated hundreds of patients

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:90%
with this program.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
It consists of a low-fat,
purely plant-based diet.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're willing to take
the time and have the patients

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
understand the science behind
this and they really realize

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that they have caused this
disease by the foods that

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
they've eaten, they suddenly
realize that you are empowering

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
them as this locus of control
to halt their disease.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to depend upon
a cardiologist or an operation

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
or a drug that may have
significant side effects.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
They are being empowered
to do this themselves.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> With Dr. Esselstyn's
help, Sharon Kintz, too,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:84%
completely
restructured her diet,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
doing away with all
animal products.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:84%
She turned down the heart
surgery recommended to her

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
by her doctors.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Sharon Kintz decided to
use food as medicine.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I was on it for four
weeks and the pain went away

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
in my arms, the pain
went away in my jaws,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and I had much more energy.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So I took Dr. Esselstyn's
program very seriously.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When Sharon Kintz
was first diagnosed,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:90%
she could hardly walk anymore.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And nearly two years after her
treatment with Dr. Esselstyn,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:84%
she is physically fit
again, and she has

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled one of her dreams.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
In 2012 at the age of
68, she successfully

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:84%
took part in a half marathon
for the first time in her life.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.997 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I know people are
cramped for time,

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
but you're talking
about your health.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live
a long, healthy life

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
contribute something,

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
then you have to take care of
your body in order to do that.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.081 align:middle line:84%
You have to, in my
opinion, eat plant based.

00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.465 align:middle line:84%
>> We also consume
too much milk.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the availability of dairy
products continues to grow.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But do these products
actually agree with us?

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
After all, nearly 75% of
the world's population

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and 20% of Europeans
are lactose intolerant--

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
in other words, unable to
properly digest dairy products.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Dairy products contain
no complex carbohydrates,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
or roughage, and
very few vitamins.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they are full of
saturated fat, cholesterol,

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:90%
and animal protein.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.392 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.392 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're young
and growing up,

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:84%
everybody wants to try to feed
people dairy products and make

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
sure you have milk every day,
but the science really now is

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
at a point where that
cannot be sustained.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
There is ample evidence
from wonderful investigators

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
like T. Colin Campbell who
clearly show that casein, which

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is the major protein in milk,
is really one of the strongest

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.255 align:middle line:90%
promoters of cancer.

00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> T. Colin Campbell is a
world-renowned nutritional

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:90%
scientist.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
In a series of
experiments, he was

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
able to prove that
animal proteins-- casein

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
in particular-- promote all
stages of cancer growth.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
In experiments, rats were
given carcinogenic substances.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, half were fed
a 5% casein-enriched diet

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and the other half 20%.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
20% roughly corresponds
to the amount

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:90%
consumed in Western diets.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
With a 5% casein-enriched
diet, the animals

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:90%
did not develop cancer.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
With a 20% casein-enriched
diet, however, cancer growth

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%
was stimulated significantly.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Professor Campbell
went a step further.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Every three weeks, he
altered the rats' diet.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So the next thing we did, we
did some studies to start out

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
with animals here and then let
the cancer start to grow with

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:84%
20% casein, and then
we switched it to 5%.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It went off.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We gave the 20% back
again, came back again.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:90%
We put it on 5%, it came off.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So we could turn on and
turn off cancer development

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
just by switching the amount
of casein being consumed.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.285 align:middle line:84%
>> These findings are also
supported by evidence with

00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:26.085 align:middle line:90%
humans.

00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We also know that all the
saturated fat and the casein

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and dairy helps to accelerate
and promote heart disease.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this whole problem

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:90%
of fractures in the elderly.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this problem of
increasing cancer, increasing

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
heart disease, and
increasing fracture--

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:90%
not a good thing.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Dairy really should be out.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.672 align:middle line:90%
>> And dairy also has--

00:15:21.672 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and there's good
evidence for this.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:84%
It has some
allergenic properties.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It tends to be associated
with allergies,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
either directly associated or
enhancing the allergies coming

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%
from another source.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we see things like
in a case of teenage boys,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:90%
we get this acne.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
They get his acne
sometimes, a skin problem.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that is due to
their consumption of dairy.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Stop dairy, it goes away.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Dairy's associated
with migrant headaches.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people have
these migraine headaches.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an allergy
kind of thing as is acne.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
allergy kind of thing.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:90%
You stop that, it goes away.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's very fast.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And I used to say that
with great reluctance

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:84%
because I was raised
on a dairy farm.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:90%
I grew up milking cows.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went away to
do my doctoral dissertation,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I actually did my dissertation
on the idea of promoting

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:90%
more milk consumption.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying these rather
negative things about dairy

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
for any ideological reasons
or any personal reasons.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying in reference
to the evidence, the data.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what it shows.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The excessive consumption of
animal products, such as meat,

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:84%
fish, dairy products, and eggs,
puts a strain on our bodies.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
That was also what
Frankfurt-based physician

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Lothar Wendt found
in his research.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
>> T. Colin Campbell arrived
at the same conclusion.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
He has been at the cutting
edge of nutritional research

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
for more than 40 years,
and in the '80s and '90s,

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:84%
he directed the
China-Cornell-Oxford Project,

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:90%
better known as the China Study.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
comprehensive nutrition study

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
biomedical research to date.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It confirmed Campbell's theory.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We tend to want
to consume protein,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
which means we want
to consume meat,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:84%
because that supposedly
makes us strong.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It makes us healthy.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
That's been an old
story for a long time.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, as we put more
and more protein, or meat,

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
into our diet, we see these
diseases start to appear.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The China Study as well
as numerous other studies

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate one
thing above all--

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the higher the consumption
of animal products,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
the greater the frequency
of heart disease, cancer,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, and countless
other chronic diseases.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Even small amounts
of animal products

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
can have a negative
effect on our health.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The 53-year-old electrical
engineer Arthur Soteros also

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:90%
became a victim of his diet--

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
excessive amounts of meat,
fish, and dairy products.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:84%
The consequences
caught up with him.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> My first health issues
started about 20 some years

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:84%
ago, about 20 years ago when I
was about 30, 32 years of age.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
type 2 diabetes.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:84%
About 10 years later,
propagated into heart disease.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
My first encounter with
heart disease was at age 42.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.720 align:middle line:84%
What I exhibited
was just heartburn

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:90%
turned out to be a blockage.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I went to the emergency room
and found out it was a blockage

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and it required an
intervention and stent.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:90%
That was my first encounter.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> A stent is an implant
designed to hold a vessel open.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Arthur Soteros needed to have
five such stents implanted.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:84%
He repeatedly suffered from
chest pain and a narrowing

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle line:90%
of his blood vessels.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he needed double
coronary bypass surgery.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was sure that, after
doing the bypass surgery,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that I would be free and
clear of any heart issues

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:84%
for at least upwards
to about 10 years.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:84%
That happened not to
be the case with me.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
About a year into that,
I developed angina again

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and what turned out not
then to be the vein graft

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that they used in
my bypass surgery

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
had now blocked,
which then required

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
another stent and then,
a few months later,

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:84%
another stent till the
frequency of those stents

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
then became just
two weeks apart.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The quickly returning vessel
occlusions baffled the doctors.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.941 align:middle line:84%
Soteros left the
hospital without hope.

00:20:21.941 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I wept, and I cried like
a baby because I wasn't ready

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:90%
to die.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.645 align:middle line:84%
And I cried out to
God for some options.

00:20:36.645 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:90%

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I think was five months

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a follow-up
with my cardiologists

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%

said that my diabetes was gone.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:84%

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:90%
with my optometrist.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.765 align:middle line:84%

wearing these things,
that all I needed

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%
was just reading glasses.

wrong, that a diet that's

In addition, male

It is not economical

In spite of this,

Cows are forced to achieve

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.910 align:middle line:84%
In the '60s, a cow

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Today, that amount has
risen to 10,000 and more.

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I have quite a few vegetarian
friends who consume dairy

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:26.140 align:middle line:84%
products, and they believe this
false idea that dairy products

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:31.930 align:middle line:84%
are a benign animal product,
that there's no harm connected

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.840 align:middle line:84%
to milk because
they figure, well,

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.710 align:middle line:84%
once a cow starts giving
milk, she just gives milk,

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and they don't realize that
cows can't give adequate amount

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of milk for production
unless they're pregnant.

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And cows have the same gestation
period as humans-- nine months.

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They're pregnant nine
months, give birth.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Within 24 hours,
maximum 72 hours,

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.520 align:middle line:84%
they take the calf
away from the cow

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.549 align:middle line:84%
because you need the
milk for production.

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
She'll have four calves.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Just genetic roulette--
two are going to be male,

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.220 align:middle line:90%
two are going to be female.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The two males are no use
to the dairy industry.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go to
auction within a day

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
to two or three
days after birth.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
You only need one female
to replace the mom.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:25.054 align:middle line:84%
So three out of four calves
go to slaughter right

01:01:25.054 --> 01:01:26.264 align:middle line:90%

got your breast

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's what many

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%

think, oh, goat's milk

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.870 align:middle line:90%
is better than cow's milk.

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the goat is

not for human consumption,

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:07.318 align:middle line:84%
but for the consumption
of a little baby goat,

01:03:07.318 --> 01:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's who the
milk should go to.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:29.010 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> People wonder
whether animals,

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.440 align:middle line:84%
including farm animals,
have emotional lives,

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and the science tells
us that they do.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
If people read and understand
what Charles Darwin had

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to say about evolution, he said
that the differences amongst

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
species are shades of
gray, not black and white.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So if we have something,
then they have it too,

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.060 align:middle line:90%
they being other animals.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So the science tells us
that many animals, including

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
farm animals, have very rich
and deep emotional lives.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:19.070 align:middle line:90%


01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The main thing is
that these farm animals,

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
when you know them
as individuals,

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.740 align:middle line:90%
they're just wonderful.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
nothing like hearing

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
the whicker of a horse
when you come and he's

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
pleased to see you
and the cows chewing

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
the cud and the sweet
breath that they

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%
have out in the fields.

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And pigs-- well, pigs are
as intelligent as dogs

01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and more intelligent than most.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a
little girl, I used

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to want to have a
little troupe of pigs

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and train them and
go to a circus.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, now I know
circuses are bad,

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.780 align:middle line:90%
but when I was a little girl--

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
you know.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.943 align:middle line:84%
Pigs are amazing,
just incredible.

01:04:56.943 --> 01:04:59.901 align:middle line:90%


01:04:59.901 --> 01:05:00.887 align:middle line:90%

01:05:00.887 --> 01:05:01.687 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:05:01.687 --> 01:05:02.487 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:05:02.487 --> 01:05:03.352 align:middle line:90%
Good, boy.

01:05:03.352 --> 01:05:23.080 align:middle line:90%


01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> People want to think
that cows are stupid,

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that they're dumb, that they're
slow and all they do is eat

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.740 align:middle line:90%
grass.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:29.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.910 align:middle line:90%
They have community.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.320 align:middle line:90%
They have social structures.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.240 align:middle line:90%
They babysit for each other.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They mourn for the
loss of loved ones.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're a community just
like any human community.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
They just look different.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.120 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the only difference.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:48.100 align:middle line:90%
They just look different.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't speak their language.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.921 align:middle line:90%
That's the only difference.

01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:59.770 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We know, for example, that
chickens display empathy.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They feel the pain
of other chickens.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
We know that cows and
pigs are very smart.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.660 align:middle line:90%
They miss one another.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.270 align:middle line:90%
They love to be around friends.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Cows and pigs are
extremely intelligent.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
They can learn
very complex tasks.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say that
the animals who we eat

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
are very smart and
they're very emotional.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
They're not what we eat.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So if there's an animal on the
plate or at the end of a fork,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
it's who's for
dinner, not what's

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
for dinner, because when
we use the word "who,"

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
we're referring to an animal
who has a very strong inner life

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%
and subjective life.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:07:35.810 align:middle line:90%


01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when pigs
and cows and dogs and cats

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and wolves play, it's very clear
that they enjoy themselves,

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:46.570 align:middle line:90%
that they're feeling happiness.

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:48.618 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling very gleeful.

01:07:48.618 --> 01:07:50.035 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling a
lot of pleasure.

01:07:50.035 --> 01:09:14.770 align:middle line:90%

Other animals we eat.

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Carnism teaches us to
see animals as objects.

01:21:24.970 --> 01:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So we learn to refer to
the turkey on our plate

as something rather
than someone.

01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And carnism teaches us to
see animals as abstractions,

01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
as lacking in any individuality
or personality of their own

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and, instead, simply as
abstract members of a group

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of favoritism.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of just
following a particular culture.

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we have
to do is we have

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.570 align:middle line:84%
to build a culture
and traditions based

01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:39.560 align:middle line:90%
upon compassion.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:58.630 align:middle line:90%


01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The highest form of
living, the highest value,

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.720 align:middle line:90%
is compassion.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And when there is compassion,
we maximize well-being.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
After all, the word "wealth"
comes from well-being.

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It did not mean money
in the hands of a few.

01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It meant well-being shared
across life spectrum.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%


01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think once we admit that we
humans are not the only beings

01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
with personalities,
minds, and feelings,

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
once we realize that we are
part of the animal kingdom,

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes quite as
important how we treat animals,

01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
all animals, as how
we treat each other.

01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And so only when we show respect
and consideration and concern

01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:20.260 align:middle line:84%
for other living
beings can we imagine

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.780 align:middle line:84%
a world that's more
peaceful than the one today.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:43.760 align:middle line:90%


01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We are at a threshold where
across the world people are

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
seeking the liberation of
life from this stranglehold

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
of objectification, the view
that the Earth is dead matter

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.330 align:middle line:90%
and our beings are just objects.

01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to rise in subject
to it, of an interconnected

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.490 align:middle line:90%
subject to it.

01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
No life is less important
than any other life,

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and human beings are
definitely not the emperors

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.960 align:middle line:90%
over the rest of life--

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
are just one strand
in that web of life.

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:33.860 align:middle line:90%


01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the reason that
so many people don't change

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
their behavior is because
they feel, what's the use?

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm just one person,
so what I do actually

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
can't make any difference,
and nor would it

01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
make any difference
if it was just one.

01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:56.890 align:middle line:90%


01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But more and more
and more people

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
are coming to understand
what the problems are

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.700 align:middle line:90%
and what they ought to be doing.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:15.250 align:middle line:90%


01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Never, ever think that one
person can't make a difference.

01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We tend to focus our energies
on looking for leaders,

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:29.540 align:middle line:84%
say, like Martin Luther
King or Mahatma Gandhi.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.310 align:middle line:90%


01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:34.920 align:middle line:90%
But they were just one person.

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't set out in
life to be a leader,

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and they were very
humble people.

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just that circumstances in
history drew them to the front.

01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But if we're looking for
leaders, all we have to do

01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
is go home and look in the
mirror because each one of us

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:57.980 align:middle line:84%
can make a
difference, and we do.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just making a
conscious decision

01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to make
a difference in our lives.

01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
We're not on this
planet for a long time,

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
so we need to do what
we can in the time we've

01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:12.096 align:middle line:90%
got to make a difference.

01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%

can make a difference.

Every one of us eats at least
two to three times a day.

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And every act of
conscious eating,

01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what the
consequences of your eating

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.160 align:middle line:84%
are, knowing what
you're eating is

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.350 align:middle line:90%
an act of changing the world.

to remember that you-- and I'm

01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:31.250 align:middle line:90%
you make a difference.

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:33.650 align:middle line:84%
You as an individual
