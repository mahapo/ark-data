How could inhabitants
of ancient Peru

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
build these wonders without
having any modern know-how?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:90%
They did provide an answer.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:84%
They believe the gods
transmitted their knowledge.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%

evolved civilization

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:84%
More than a century has passed
since the first finding,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
but the gusty winds of
the Paracas Peninsula,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
about 250 kilometers
south of Lima,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
have not removed traces of
the giant drawing carved

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:90%
in the sand.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It is called the Paracas
Trident, or Candelabra.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
It seems that it was created
by the Paracas culture, who

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
inhabited this region
between 300 BC and 280 AD,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:90%
but this is just conjecture.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the few
stories which do

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
mention it don't
reveal the authors,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and neither do they indicate
its date of creation.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
No analyses are available
to date a simple excavation

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
in the sand, and no
organic finds nearby

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
were unearthed like clothing,
tools, or other finds

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
crucial for carbon-14
dating, which are normally

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:84%
associated with a place
to define a, more or less,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:90%
accurate date.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Even its significance
is uncertain.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:10%
It was conjectured that it
could be a sign pointing

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:10%
towards areas of the
ancient empire like Cuzco,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu, or Nazca.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:10%
But when checked, it appeared
that its central axis

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:10%
extends and ends directly
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Others have conjectured
that it could

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
be a religious symbol,
perhaps the tree of life,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
or the representation on Earth
of a constellation, perhaps

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the Southern Cross.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:10%
In any case, the
almost 200 meters

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:10%
of the central vertical
axis, the nearly 120 meters

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:10%
of the horizontal axis, and
the 40 degree inclination

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:10%
seem devised to make it
visible from a great distance--

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:10%
a signal, therefore,
a sort of lighthouse.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Arriving from the
sea, in fact, it

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
starts to be seen even
more than 15 kilometers

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.769 align:middle line:90%
from the coastline.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But arriving from the sky,
it can be seen even sooner.

by the ancient god start.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
A higher entity, the
head of a population who

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
could glide over water and fly,
worshiped with different names

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:84%
throughout Central

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.206 align:middle line:84%
who had restored civilization
after the Great Flood.

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Viracocha, however,
did not resemble

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
the people who inhabited
the continent at the time.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
He did not have dark skin
and wasn't clean-shaven,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
but was rather white-skinned
and had a beard.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Could he have been
the survivor of

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:84%
an ancient, evolved
civilization today forgotten,

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
who had escaped a world-wide

The ancient Paracas population
lived around the Candelabrum

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
area and was simple
and peaceful people.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They survived on fishing
and rudimentary agriculture.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
They were skilled weavers and
created beautiful, painted

ceramic wear.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
This lifestyle, however,
is in sharp contrast

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
to the practice they
are mostly known for,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:90%
drilling and deforming skulls.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Deforming was achieved by
wrapping the head of newborns

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
with bandages or
wooden boards, which

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
compressed the
bones of the skull

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:90%
to make them grow abnormally.

This custom must have
caused much pain.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, it was practiced
for an extremely long time,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and it also spread
to more distant lands

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
like Egypt, Malta,
and Central America.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Ancient, deformed skulls dating
back more than 6,000 years

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:90%
were found in these areas.

Today, the true reason
behind this custom

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:90%
has yet to be discovered.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Aesthetic reasons do not seem
to justify its use, and the fact

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that its spread to civilizations
which had no direct contact

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.470 align:middle line:84%
renders its expansion
even more unfathomable.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Other populations, too,
practice deformities

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
which, today, are considered
abhorrent like the Mayan custom

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to induce strabismus or the
Chinese to deform women's feet.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But these habits have remained
confined to those cultures

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
without spreading
to other populations

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:90%
like skull deformation has.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
This deformity was also
considered a distinctive sign

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.632 align:middle line:84%
and performed only
within the highest ranks.

00:07:19.632 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:10%
The Viracocha representations,
which have come down to us,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:10%
depict a being with a
stocky bust, short legs,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:10%
and especially big head.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:10%
Could it be that
deforming skulls

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.332 align:middle line:10%
was a way to resemble the gods?

in the small town of Ica.

Loved and respected by the
people all the more because he

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
was a descendant of
the city founders,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
he progressively transformed his

The story starts in 1966,
when a friend gave Cabrera

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.214 align:middle line:84%
a stone with the drawing of a
prehistoric animal engraved.

00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that it
had been found next

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
to the Ocucaje Desert and
that there were many more.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
The stones had also
generated some trading.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the farmers
would collect the stones

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and sell them to
tourists as souvenirs.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They told him that the stones
had been brought to light

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
in 1960 after the
flooding of the Río Ica.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Cabrera was thunderstruck.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Thereafter, the Peruvian doctor
started to collect and study

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
these stones with passion,
a mission he pursued

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.010 align:middle line:90%
until his death in 2001.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
As he continued in his
research, the doctor

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
was increasingly convinced
that the drawings carved

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:84%
on the stones were not just
simple, artistic creations,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
but some sort of
ideographic writing.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
The images, in fact, were
subdivided by Cabrera

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:84%
into subjects and illustrate
the complex knowledge

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of, more or less, familiar
subjects like astronomy

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and geography, but also
more unusual like surgery.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
The stones can, therefore,
be rightfully considered

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:90%
as pages of a vast library.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%

representations

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%

men with dinosaurs.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But if dinosaurs became
extinct 65 million years ago,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and it is thought that
man's appearance on Earth

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
only dates back a few
million years ago,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
how can it be that they
are depicted together

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:90%
on these stones?

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult to imagine that
this civilization had reached

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%

during such a distant era.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Anatomy, in fact, was
only born in the 1400s,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%

only dates back to 1967.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge that
the Earth is round

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
only goes back a
few centuries BC,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and the use of the telescope
for astronomic studies

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
is owed to Galileo
Galilei in the 1600s.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Horses became extinct
thousands of years

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%

by the Spanish to the Americas

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:90%
in the 1500s.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
inhabitants of Peru

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:84%
never used the wheel, while
the pre-Columbian populations

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
certainly did not know
what kangaroos were.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Are we faced with the greatest
archaeological discovery

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
of our times or with
a resounding fraud?

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Various archaeologists
believe these are counterfeits

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.086 align:middle line:84%
mainly created by a
couple of campesinos

00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to sell them to
tourists, and this theory

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
needs to take into account
the following data.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It is estimated that,
between the Cabrera finds,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:84%
those owned by
Peruvian collectors,

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and those taken abroad,
the amount of carved stones

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:90%
amounts to over 50,000 pieces.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's an enormous amount,
even for a tireless couple

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:90%
of forgers.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.570 align:middle line:84%
In addition, many stones weigh
several hundred kilograms.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Why create such cumbersome
souvenirs so hard to sell?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is really hard to believe
that two campesinos barely

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
able to read and
write could ever

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
have acquired the scientific
knowledge carved on the stones.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
The reporter Juan de Santa
Cruz Pachacuti Yamqui,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.010 align:middle line:84%
in an article of
the 1500s, reports

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Incas would call them
[? Manco ?] stones, meaning

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
power stones, and
these were part

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
of the funerary vestiges
of noble families based

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:90%
on an ancient tradition.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
This is confirmed by the
fact that, in August 1966,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.020 align:middle line:84%
several samples were
found in pre-Inca tombs

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
by the president of Lima's
Polytechnic Institute, Mr.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Santiago Agurto Calvo, and by
the archaeologist Alejandro

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Pezzia of the National
Institute of Archeology in Peru.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
The news appeared in
December of the same year

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific supplement
of a Lima daily newspaper,

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
but the most sensational
scientific fact

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
derives from the lab
analysis on the stones.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Cabrera had them
analyzed by the mining

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:84%
engineering company
Mauricio Hochschild.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And by the Mineralogy
and Petrology Institute

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:90%
of Bonn University in Germany.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Based on the oxidation layer,
which covers the engravings,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
it seems that the
stones were engraved

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:90%
at least 12,000 years ago.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The Lima Aeronautic Museum,
which owns about 60 samples,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
had the analysis repeated,
and the data were confirmed.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The engravings are at
least 12,000 years old.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, these
are not the millions

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of years which can be
surmised from the scenes

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
with men and dinosaurs
living together.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Yet even 12,000 years ago,
dinosaurs were already extinct,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and we know of no
civilizations of the time which

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:90%
had such advanced knowledge.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
According to Cabrera,
this culture,

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
which he called
gliptolihic civilization,

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle line:84%
disappeared due to
a planet catastrophe

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:84%
caused by the wrong use
of their own technology.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Could they perhaps be survivors
who created their engravings

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to hand down their knowledge and
history to generations to come?

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It is also true that farmers
can realize imitations--

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:90%
and there are many--

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:84%
but these are easy
to unmask with tests.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Ica stones
remain an archaeological mystery

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
with their fantastic
representations.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:90%

the greatest breakthroughs

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:90%
of the modern age.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Only some time ago, it was
believed an impossible feat.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And the use of the sun
as a source of energy

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:90%
is also a recent victory.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Who is this unknown
population which

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the
chasm of time with

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:90%
this sophisticated knowledge?

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:10%
The aspect of gliptolihic
men incredibly

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:10%
resembles the
Viracocha depictions,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:10%
especially the one found
on the Door of the Sun

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:10%
in Tiahuanaco on the shores of
the Titicaca Lake in Bolivia.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's a man with
stumpy legs, large belly,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:10%
and large head out of
proportion to his body,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:10%
the same physical makeup
of the gliptolihic men.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:10%
After all, Ica is next
to the Candelabrum area

their affiliation

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:10%
to the noble classes,
they would deform skulls.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps to resemble
the ancient Viracochas?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The Paracas also
perforated skulls.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And on the Ica stones,
the gliptolihic men

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
are depicted performing
brain surgery.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet on the
Paracas Peninsula,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
there's the Candelabrum, which,
according to Zecharia Sitchin,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
indicates the beginning of
the areas where Viracocha

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:90%
had lived with his group.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:10%

to the Nazca Plain,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:10%

casual coincidence?

The Spanish were exchanged

order to recognize the drawings

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:84%
carved in the rock, they
should be viewed from the right

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.300 align:middle line:84%
distance and angle, and
the precise light and shade

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.600 align:middle line:84%
conditions at the
right time of day,

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and even right
season of the year.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Lacking these prerequisites, the
sculptures are indecipherable.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:84%
This rock was called the
African Lion by the scholar,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and one can guess
the profile only

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.230 align:middle line:84%

certain perspective,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:90%
exactly as explained by Ruzo.

If viewed from other angles, it
shows no comprehensible shape.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Identifying the sculptures
is made even more difficult

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.170 align:middle line:84%

These are currently
unusable, obstructed

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.740 align:middle line:90%
by debris and cave-ins.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But once, they connected the
waters of the two rivers where

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Chavín de Huántar
nestles in the middle.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Huanchecsa overlooks
Chavín and Mosna,

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.950 align:middle line:90%
which is at a lower height.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.290 align:middle line:10%
The water descended
from Huanchecsa,

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.080 align:middle line:10%
and it would fill the
large, sunken square

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.050 align:middle line:10%
in front of the Castillo
through its channels

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.810 align:middle line:10%
to finally flow in the Mosna.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Could it be that such a
sophisticated water network

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:10%
only had a ritual purpose, and
could the Chavín underground be

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.070 align:middle line:10%
part of the legendary network of
tunnels which connected ancient

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:10%
sites of a forgotten past?

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Lopez, archaeologist
in charge of Chavín,

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:84%
states that there truly are
underground tunnels which

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:37.350 align:middle line:84%
depart from Chavín towards
other unexplored settlements

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.374 align:middle line:90%
of the surrounding mountains.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:48.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancient Chavín population
mentioned tunnels which

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:51.060 align:middle line:10%
connected an area
northeast of here,

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.910 align:middle line:10%
about 2 kilometers away
in the higher mountains.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.760 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Chavín
people spoke of this,

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:03.300 align:middle line:84%
so it is likely this
connection truly exists.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> For the first time,
video cameras have entered

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:84%
the tunnels in Chavín, some
of which are still unexplored.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.150 align:middle line:90%


00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult path,
and the presence of bats

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.630 align:middle line:90%
makes it even less accessible.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The network of underground
tunnels is intricate,

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and the conjecture that
the whole structure only

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:31.250 align:middle line:84%
had a religious purpose is
increasingly less acceptable.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Did the Chavín population
really build the complex,

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:39.620 align:middle line:84%
or did it simply settle
in buildings it had found,

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.950 align:middle line:84%
readapting these to
its requirements,

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:45.710 align:middle line:84%
buildings constructed by
a population which had

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:49.190 align:middle line:84%
disappeared and with
more advanced knowledge?

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.910 align:middle line:84%
The American archaeologist
Ephraim George Squier,

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:84%
in his book "Peru, Incidents
of Travel and Explorations

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Lands of Incas"
published in 1887,

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:84%
believed that two, distinct
cultural eras existed

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in Peru's history, one extremely
ancient with the most advanced

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:84%
scientific knowledge, and
the other much more recent

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
like that of the Incas with
a lower cultural level.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.420 align:middle line:84%
According to Squier, an
extremely hard to calculate

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.630 align:middle line:84%
span of time, but
certainly broad,

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.210 align:middle line:84%
passed between
these two cultures.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.670 align:middle line:84%
He is also convinced
that the ancient

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and sophisticated
Peruvian finds are

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:38.090 align:middle line:84%
evidence of an advanced
technology, heritage

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of a forgotten humanity.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.760 align:middle line:84%
The tunnels unwind for
still unknown distances,

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.650 align:middle line:84%
also due to the danger
of covering them.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Many are damaged or obstructed,
and in fact, in the end,

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.670 align:middle line:84%
it becomes impossible
to continue.

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, there are side
exits, which suddenly emerge

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.700 align:middle line:90%
from the large, main square.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.420 align:middle line:84%
The tunnels and the entire
Chavín complex still remain

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.380 align:middle line:84%
an unsolved mystery, and the
uncertainty of their real

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:14.420 align:middle line:84%
origins is increasingly
more substantiated.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Who really built these?

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Professor Walter Krickeberg, in
his book ""[INAUDIBLE] American

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Cultures," sustains the
most ancient and advanced

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.500 align:middle line:84%
pre-Columbian civilizations
appear suddenly,

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:35.400 align:middle line:84%
apparently without any roots
and preliminary stages.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.600 align:middle line:84%
This can only be explained
by an external impulse, which

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:43.660 align:middle line:90%
influenced ancient America.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:48.460 align:middle line:84%
An external impulse,
exactly what has been orally

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.890 align:middle line:84%
narrated by the ancient
pre-Columbian populations.

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The Viracochas, men
of great knowledge

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and with extraordinary
powers, with their white skin

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and beards, gave birth
to civilization once more

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:90%
