in life and not just
religions with rules.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I've puzzled over metaphysics
and esoteric books,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
dabbled in yoga and meditation.

psychic than the next person .

Certainly, not as
psychic as my cat, who

mysteriously knows to disappear

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Recently, three strange events
happened around me all at once.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
First, there was the
story of my daughter.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Um, I had a dream where I was
in the house of Taneth mother

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:10%
And her mother was lying in her
bed and she was suffering from

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:10%
something and she was
saying help me, help me.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And she was reaching her hand.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
No one was helping
her, and I felt

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
as if I was part of the
ceiling looking down.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember the
dream when I woke up.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I woke up from normal.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.255 align:middle line:84%
And it was, we were
walking on the beach

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
that we got a call from
Taneth that her mother had

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:90%
died that night.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I was like totally
freaked out as though I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
could have seen the future.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I felt as though I
could have helped her.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Then out of the blue, I felt
compelled by some strong force

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:90%
to ring my father.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Only to be told he
had had an accident

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:90%
and was in intensive care.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Then the third thing happened.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I was filming my friend's
wedding and a spoon bending

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:90%
performer turned up.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:90%
I watched him like a hawk.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:90%
He had to be a fraud.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And a little blow
makes it back to--

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Then I invited him home
to bend my kitchen spoons,

00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:03.385 align:middle line:84%
and I could observe his
tricks a little closer.

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:16.924 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.924 --> 00:05:17.871 align:middle line:90%
>> Stainless steel.

00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Stainless steel, wonderful.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So it is a stainless
steel teaspoon.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'll take it and I'll
rub it between the head

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and the neck.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, sorry.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:39.082 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.082 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know how he did it,
but I'm sure it's a sleight

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:90%
of hand.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But I know the other
two incidents were real.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
How do I distinguish
between tricks and truth?

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Tell the difference between
a psychic and a fraud?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
science has to say

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:90%
about these mysterious matters.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to know if, how, and why.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.248 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And is there an explanation
or evidence to prove them?

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
California has always had a
great tolerance for innovation

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:90%
and new ways of thinking.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
There are plenty of
scientists to talk to

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and the one who has
agreed to guide me

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.765 align:middle line:84%
on this journey lives in my old
university town of Berkeley.

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I am on my way to
Professor Tart.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the grandfathers
of Para-psychology

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
as he has been investigating
psychic phenomena for almost

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:90%
half a century.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, Renee.

00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect to be
filmed opening the door,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:90%
but what the heck.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Come in.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>> The psychical research or
Para-psychology as it morphed

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:10%
into eventually, has been around
for roughly 100 and some years.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, there have
been a few psychic phenomena

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that have been explored
at great length

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
such that there are hundreds
of experiments demonstrating

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.647 align:middle line:90%
the reality of each of those.

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
There are also some
things that simply

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.688 align:middle line:84%
haven't been investigated that
much and that might or might

00:07:22.688 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:90%
not be real.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that are real
by any reasonable criteria

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of science are the ones
I call the big five.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's telepathy
on the one hand-- mind

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to mind communication.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Second is clairvoyance--
the direct knowledge

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world
when it's not known

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:90%
to anyone else at that time.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.325 align:middle line:84%
The third of the big
five is precognition.

00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And I must say,
this is the one I

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
have the most trouble
with intellectually

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
because I can't really
imagine how it could happen.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence
shows that it happens.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The fourth of the big
five is psycho-kinesis,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:84%
or telekinesis to
use an older term--

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:90%
mind over matter.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth is
psychic healing.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
These I call the big
five simply because there

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:84%
are hundreds of
experiments supporting

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.334 align:middle line:90%
the reality of each one.

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are very
rigorous experiments.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.524 align:middle line:84%
They are done to much
higher standards of control

00:08:18.524 --> 00:08:20.815 align:middle line:84%
than experiments in almost
all other fields of science.

00:08:20.815 --> 00:08:24.666 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:27.865 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes, that's a nice twist.

00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
And you can still use it.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think of the
bent spoon stuff

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
as the universe sort
of teasing us sometimes

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:90%
as to what's going on here.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:10%
I much prefer to rely on the
laboratory research on mind

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:10%
over matter where
we do have things

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:10%
happen under conditions where
you actually know what went on.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:57.818 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.818 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that Professor Tart
is retired from UC Davis,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
he teaches at the Institute
of Transpersonal Psychology

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:90%
in Palo Alto.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:16.078 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I got into the spiritual
emergency business without

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:10%
knowing I was going to get
into it 40 some years ago.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:10%
And over the years,
I have gotten,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:10%
it must be, thousands
of phone calls, letters,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:10%
mostly emails now
from people who

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:10%
have had unusual experiences.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of cases, they're
frightened, they're confused.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
what's happened to them.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.345 align:middle line:84%
And I would look
at the experiences

00:09:42.345 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say oh,
yes, well, that's

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
a telepathic
experience and that's

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
an apparition of the
dead and so forth.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And sort of gave it a name.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Trans is talking
about breakthroughs

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:84%
or mystical experiences
or epiphanies

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%

with nature or something

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
like that, and it's a real
feeling not just an idea

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:90%
but a real deep feeling.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what we mean by a
transpersonal experience.

pass through the cabin window

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:90%
as we were coming home.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
look at the heavens,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly realized that
the molecules of my body

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and the molecules
in the spacecraft

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
had been manufactured and
created and prototyped

in some ancient
generation of stars.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:10%
And instead of a
intellectual knowledge,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:10%
it was a visceral knowing
and connection, a feeling

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:10%
of connection with the star
systems that created us,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:10%
created the matter
in our bodies.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was accompanied by
a very blissful feeling

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had never
experienced before.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
A life changing
sort of experience.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And one that, I think,
I've come to realize

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
is, perhaps, our
evolutionary destiny

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:90%

This is fortunate as they were

Dean Radin is one of the most
famous para-psychologists

in the US.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Like Professor Tart, he
is a well-published author

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and has been doing experiments
into psychic phenomena for 30

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:90%
odd years.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.367 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.367 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you think this is a trick?

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:10%
>> In this case,
you have to ask,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:10%
is it possible in principle
to do this with force?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.904 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:13:20.904 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Then the second question
is can somebody dissociate,

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.861 align:middle line:84%
so they're not aware
of what they're doing?

00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.513 align:middle line:84%
So in a case like
this, we don't know.

00:13:27.513 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the overall
results of experiments

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
on telepathy and clairvoyance
and precognition and also

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
psycho-kinesis, you find
that the cumulative data

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is quite strong in favor of
the existence of these effects.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
You also find that the effects
are much weaker in what

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.497 align:middle line:84%
you see in the laboratory
and what people typically

00:13:59.497 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:90%
report in their real life.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> My daughter was very
young, probably around 2.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And we were walking
down the street,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and I suddenly was
confronted by what

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be an angel
standing in front of me

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and telling me to go to the
other side of the street

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and to move very quickly.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So I picked my daughter up
and ran across the street.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned
around to look behind me

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to see what was
happening just as they

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
were trying to lower a grand
piano from an upstairs window.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And the cable snapped on the
piano it came straight down

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and crashed.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The keys flew right out
sideways in both directions.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the experiences
that people have in life with

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
so-called crisis telepathy and
precognition in dreams and that

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
sort of thing, we know that in
principle some of that is real

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But on the basis of any
given story, you never know.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Dean is currently
investigating precognition,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:90%
also called presentiment.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It is an ability to foresee
or foresense the future.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
It can occur as a vision,
a mental flash, or a dream.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you see the future?

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's, at this point,
bring in Oshara's head

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of her
body can follow.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
The experiment
involving eye tracker

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is looking for presentiment
in the eye essentially.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So when the
experiment is running,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that Oshara's
eye will be here,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's tracking the eye.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is what she will see.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:10%
The movement of the pupil
is reflective in both

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:10%
of the amount of light
that's coming in,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:10%
but it also reflects
her emotional response

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:10%
to what you're looking at.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So we hope to find
in this experiment is

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that when you see an
emotional picture,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.612 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a certain
big response in your pupil.

00:16:17.612 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you see a calm
picture, you have a response,

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:90%
but it's not so big.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.182 align:middle line:90%
That's when you see it.

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The question is what happens
to your eye before you see it.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the case before
you see these pictures,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.905 align:middle line:84%
you're always looking
at a gray screen.

00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't expect by
any conventional reason

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that the eye would be
changing, but the presentiment

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
study suggests that
the eye and the body--

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
everything in the
body does change.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It is responding to,
apparently, your future.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.914 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:49.914 --> 00:16:55.269 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's the three second
period before the picture is

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:90%
selected.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.902 align:middle line:84%
And what we hope to
find is that when

00:17:01.902 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
there is a big emotional
response in the future

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.337 align:middle line:84%
and causes an
emotional dilation,

00:17:06.337 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a
similar dilation beforehand.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you see, that's
what ended up with her.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
This difference
in pupil dilation

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:90%
mimics what happens later.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:84%
So this is a presentiment,
this area here.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.329 align:middle line:90%
So the future is very emotional.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It may, in a sense,
leap backwards in time

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:90%
and affect how you behave now.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Most of the evidence
in the laboratory

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
comes from the equivalent
of college sophomores.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
They come from people, just
ordinary people, who are maybe

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:90%
interested in this, maybe not.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I think of this study as
looking through the window

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:90%
to the soul to see the future.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the poetic way of
thinking about this study.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:10%

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, or was, is that
Deepak had just left a few days

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
before to go on a safari
to Africa with his family.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:10%
And right before
he left he called,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:10%
and he said I'm going
to be completely

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:10%
unreachable for
the next two weeks.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:10%
And this was way before
email or cell phones,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and it just wasn't going to
be possible to call them.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And the producer said to me,
I need to know in 24 hours

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:90%
if he can be on January 2.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was just going
crazy thinking,

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I can't commit him because
I don't know his schedule.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say no because
it's such a great opportunity.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So I just said, OK, I'll
call you back in 15 minutes.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And I close my eyes
and inside of my mind,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I screamed as loud as I could--

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:90%
"Deepak!

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Call me!"

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And 10 seconds later, the
phone rang, and it was Deepak.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what do you need?

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how did you know?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, I knew.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.314 align:middle line:90%
And I told him.

00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, of course,
I'll do the show

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:90%
and January 2 is perfect.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.057 align:middle line:84%
I called the producer
back, we booked it,

00:19:37.057 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and everything worked out.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Telepathy means instant
communication between two

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
people, regardless of distance,
through means other than

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:90%
the five senses.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The person who has done the
most research on telepathy,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:84%
thousands of experiments
in the last 30 years,

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:84%
is the British biologist and
philosopher Rupert Sheldrake.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Telepathy happens between
people who are closely bonded

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:10%
emotionally or between
people and animals.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:90%
This is a close emotional bond.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't typically
happen between strangers.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of experiments
on telephone telepathy

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that show that people really
can tell who's calling.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
In these experiments, the
caller names four people

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:90%
they know well.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
They give us their
phone numbers.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.325 align:middle line:90%
We pick one of the four senders.

00:20:33.325 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:90%
The sender rings them up.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:90%
The phone rings.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:10%
They have to guess before they
answer the phone who's calling.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Maureen.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Maureen.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, oh, yes!

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> By chance, they'd be
right one time in four--

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:90%
25%.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
In our experiments, they're
right about 45% of the time.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I now have an
automated version

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of this experiment for
emails on the internet

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and also for SMS messages.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's now possible to do these
experiments on a wide scale

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
using modern technologies.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy works between people
who know each other well.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
The sense of being stared at
often happens with strangers.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think in
nature, it's probably

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:84%
evolved in connection with
predator/prey relationships.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That if prey animals
could tell and predators

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
were looking at them,
they'd escape better than

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:90%
if they couldn't tell.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And this sense of
being stared at

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
is common in animals,
not just in people.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a biological phenomenon.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Our conscious awareness
is a very thin slice of what

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
we're actually able to perceive,
and there's a huge amount

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of additional perception
going on below the surface.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So another category of
telepathy experiments

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
is whether or not you
can feel that someone

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:90%
is paying attention to you.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.177 align:middle line:84%
So it's sometimes called
remote staring experiments.

00:22:17.177 --> 00:22:18.885 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I think
you're looking at me,

00:22:18.885 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:90%
look at the camera.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I do that.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm going to do now
is make sure that we're picking

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:90%
up the physiology OK.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
We take two people
and separate them.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.834 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having one try
to mentally send information

00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
to the other, you
simply have them

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
look at a closed circuit
video image of them

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and try to mentally
or intend very

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
intently to capture
their attention-- simply

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
by looking at them.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Just waiting here
for image to come up,

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as it comes up,
put every ounce of intention

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.736 align:middle line:84%
that you can have
on to the screen.

00:22:55.736 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at us.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's the
end of the 10 seconds.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment when
the TV screen turns on.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And so she immediately
stops relaxing,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
starts to become more aroused,
and then near the end of it,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:90%
begins to relax again.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So this suggests that
this kind of response--

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:84%
skin conductance arousal
and a restriction in blood

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:90%
flow during that period.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
If it happens often
enough on average

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
over the course of the session,
then it gives us evidence

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that she was responding
physiologically

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.981 align:middle line:90%
to our distant intention.

00:23:27.981 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:10%
So what this tells us is that
these psychic connections are

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.461 align:middle line:10%
probably there all the time.

00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, they're
operating at the level

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of the unconscious.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's only
fairly rare that it

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
rises to the level of awareness
and people can report it.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
On those occasions,
when your senses

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
are turned off or
subdued, that's

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
largely where people begin
to report these other forms

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:90%
of connections.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So meditation, dreaming,
drumming, dancing,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
drugs, lots of things will
deflect your ordinary attention

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to pay more
attention to other things.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, Oscar has a
very uncanny ability.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:10%
And his uncanny ability is that
he knows when terminal dementia

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:10%
patients are about to die.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Generally, anywhere from two
to four hours before a death,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Oscar will wander into
a room and usually,

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
will leap onto the bed if
he's allowed by the family

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and stay there.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Usually, he curls up
next to the patient,

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and he almost serves as an early
warning system, so to speak,

for us.

When we know Oscar is
milling around a patient,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
we know that we need to ramp
up our end of life services.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We know that it might be time
to call the family in from home

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
because he stays until
the patient dies.

They seem to be telepathic
with their owners.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:84%
One of three ways in which
dogs show this behavior

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
is knowing when their
owners are coming home.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:84%
About 50% of dog
owners have found

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that the dog goes and waits
at the door or a window

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:90%
before the person gets home.

least five miles away.

They travel by taxi to
avoid familiar car sounds,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:10%
and the dogs still know.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:10%
They start waiting when the
person decides to go home.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're responding to
the person's intention.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:10%
And, therefore, it seems to
be a psychopathic phenomena.

person's mind, not noises

the dog when they're coming.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I think social groups of

termite nests, ants' nests,
bees' hives and flocks of birds

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and schools of fish do as well.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The whole group behaves as
if they're a single organism.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I think all social
animals, including us,

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
have fields for social groups
that link the members together

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:84%
within the group and
continues to connect

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and even when they're
away from each

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:90%
other, physically separated.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The closest physical
analogy to telepathy

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:13.556 align:middle line:84%
is in quantum physics,
quantum non-locality.

00:27:13.556 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Quantum non-locality mechanics
is when two particles have

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:90%
been part of the same system.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:10%
They're part of the same
system, they move apart,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:10%
and when they move
apart, they remain

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:10%
linked to each
other or entangled

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:10%
as quantum physicists say.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:10%
And so that a change in one
instantly affects the other.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:84%
My idea of morphic fields
is very similar in spirit

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:90%
to quantum theory.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The morphic fields are a
bit like quantum field.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:90%
They're probability structures.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Nature is organized
by invisible fields.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Living organisms are
organized by invisible fields.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be the
nature of nature.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Telepathy suggests a form
of connection between people.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So if two people are really
connected, then if you separate

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%
them and you poke one of them.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:90%
The other one should flinch.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:10%
And one of the more
interesting studies

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:10%
of this type that
I know of was told

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:10%
by colleagues at
Bastyr University

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:10%
and the University
of Washington.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:10%
They selected one couple
out of 30 couples,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:10%
and then they put
the person playing

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.644 align:middle line:10%
the role of a receiver
in a functional MRI.

00:28:30.644 --> 00:28:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a scanner that's
looking at what's happening

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:90%
in the blood flow in your head.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And they put the other
person at a distance

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and expose the descending
person to flashing lights

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.826 align:middle line:90%
or static lights.

00:28:41.826 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And the question was if
these two people are really

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:84%
connected mentally,
then when one person

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
is seeing flashing lights,
maybe the brain of the other one

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.659 align:middle line:90%
will light up as well.

00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So they did this
experiment, and they

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.417 align:middle line:84%
found that the receiver's
brain was lighting up.

00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was lighting up
in the visual cortex.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:84%
This actually not only
shows that telepathy

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is real under highly
controlled conditions,

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:84%
it tells us a little
bit about the nature

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:90%
of what that connection is.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It would be very, very
unlikely that it's

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.976 align:middle line:84%
a kind of signal
connection, meaning

00:29:14.976 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:84%
like a radio sending a signal
from one place to the other

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%
because.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:84%
The usual form of
signaling was excluded.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So instead if two
brains are, in a sense,

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.424 align:middle line:84%
almost acting like
one, it suggests

00:29:26.424 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:84%
that the connections
we're talking about

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:90%
are a holistic connection.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that begins
to point more towards a quantum

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.286 align:middle line:84%
connection rather than any
form of classical connection.

00:29:38.286 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I was approached by the
grandmother of a nine-month-old

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:90%
child that had been taken.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:84%
There was a divorce
situation going on,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.190 align:middle line:84%
so they brought me pictures
and the baby's teddy bear.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I started-- it was
kind of difficult because I

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:90%
go through thought patterns.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And because he's nine months
old and he's in a car seat,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:90%
he can't see out the windows.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So all I can see is the inside
of the cab of the truck.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I would keep track
of it over a period of days.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And then one morning I got
up and I called the officer

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:90%
that I was working with.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said he's with this
lady, and I described

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:90%
what the lady looked like.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to go to a
grocery store this morning.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I described what the
grocery store looked like

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:90%
and where was.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:84%
He figured out who the woman
was that I was talking about.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the sister of the
man who had taken the baby.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So they spent the
morning, all these agents,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:84%
walking around the grocery
store pretending to shop,

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.000 align:middle line:90%
waiting for her to show up.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And then she showed up,
she had the baby with her.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were
trying to figure out

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:84%
what to do when she
walked away and left

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
the nine-month-old
unattended in a grocery cart.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And the agents just swooped down
on the cart and rolled it away.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And they arrested her
as a co-conspirator

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:90%
for kidnapping the baby.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:84%
If I'm working from
crime scene photos, which

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is the way I prefer to
work, then the event

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.270 align:middle line:84%
itself starts
re-running in my head.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like a movie that's
been very poorly edited.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The sound doesn't
work very well.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can get snippets of
sound, a little short running

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.450 align:middle line:84%
sequence, and then
there'll be a gap.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's like watching
a poor quality movie,

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
but I've learned how to
rerun images many times,

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:84%
so that if a police
officer asks me a question,

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:90%
I can rerun the image.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Look at it from
an adjusted angle

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and get the information
they're asking me for.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So I am technically
doing remote viewing,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
although most people don't
think of it that way.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Remote viewing is
the scientific term

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
for clairvoyance-- using our
sixth sense to get information

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:90%
about a distant place or object.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a straightforward
laser physicist at Stanford

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I graduated with my PhD there.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:10%
And then I worked on a textbook,
a graduate level textbook

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.097 align:middle line:10%
on quantum electronics
and lasers.

00:32:37.097 --> 00:32:39.430 align:middle line:10%
And there's nothing like
writing a textbook on a subject

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:10%
to realize how much
you don't know.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that struck me

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
as I was working on
the book was that we

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
had a pretty good
quantum description

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:54.380 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds of mechanistic
inorganic interactions.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
a quantum theory

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that even begins to touch on
minds or that kind of thing.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Can some strange and as yet
unexplained psychic ability

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
help us to see that which is
concealed from ordinary vision?

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
in the human mind

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that can gather information
our senses do not know?

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In the early 1970s, Hal
Puthoff was the director

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of Stanford University's
Research Institute.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:84%
He was testing psychic phenomena
with algae and laser beams,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
until the psychic Ingo Swann
contacted him, offering himself

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.250 align:middle line:90%
as a test subject.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I talked to my physics
colleagues, they said, oh,

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:84%
these guys are all
frauds and charlatans.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.772 align:middle line:90%
You better be careful.

00:33:48.772 --> 00:33:50.480 align:middle line:84%
You better have a
really good experiment.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So we started doing
some experiments

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:90%
of him seeing remote locations.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.839 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I circulated
around the results

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I was getting from
these experiments.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And a few days later, the
CIA shows up at my doorstep.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And they say have we
been looking for you.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> From 1972 to 1997
during the Cold War,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:84%
the CIA funded what was known
as the Stargate Program to test

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing could be used
as an intelligence tool.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> The very first--

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:84%
not talking about
one out of 100.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:29.639 align:middle line:84%
The very first Soviet
facility we looked at

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:90%
was over in the Soviet Union.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out our remote
viewer, Pat Price in this case,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.770 align:middle line:90%
drew a picture of a crane.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm
lying on my back

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
on top of a two story building.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And this crane is
rolling over my head.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
And it's so large that a man
is only half a wheel height.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, when he told me that, I
thought that was ridiculous.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it turns out that's
exactly what the site was like.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
can see it here,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
but, in fact, that little
dot there is a man.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when we asked him what do
you think the site is used for?

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I think it's
for some space application.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:10%
It was only after
the Cold War was over

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.340 align:middle line:10%
and people from our country
got to visit location,

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.460 align:middle line:10%
we found out that, in fact, this
was for a space application.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:90%


00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The old fashioned theory
was that remote viewing had

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:10%
something to do with the
brain sending and receiving

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic brain
waves, like a mental radio

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:10%
transmitter.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And so one way to attack
that is to do experiments over

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and longer and longer distances.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we eventually did
experiments over continents

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and didn't see any degradation
of the apparent, quote, "ESP

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:90%
data."

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.884 align:middle line:84%
So distance seem to
matter, so that seemed

00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:07.300 align:middle line:84%
to be a strike against the
electromagnetic idea, the brain

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:90%
wave idea.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
We then put people
aboard submarines,

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
took them down to the
bottom of the ocean.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
There's enough shielding
of electromagnetic waves

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and conductive seawater, that
should have blocked it out.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the remote viewer
said, this is, quote,

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:84%
"psychically quiet, I
can do better than ever."

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:10%
So the major area that
we're looking at actually

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:10%
has to do with the fact that
although empty space appears

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:51.160 align:middle line:10%
to be empty, quantum physicists
know it's not really empty.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It's full of what we call
quantum fluctuation energy

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:90%
or vacuum energy.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Hal thinks there is a
mysterious energy pervading all

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
empty space in the universe,
including the cells of our body

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:90%
and our brains.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.350 align:middle line:84%
He calls it vacuum energy
or zero point energy.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It might connect us
all, in which case,

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:90%
it might explain remote viewing.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> So a liquid nitrogen tank.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's called
zero point energy

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is that even if you were to cool
the universe all the way down

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:84%
to absolute zero, where all
thermal motions get frozen out,

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.845 align:middle line:90%
this energy still exists.

00:37:35.845 --> 00:37:42.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes experiments
lead to finding--

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:84%
a very famous case was that
a Russians plane went down

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.710 align:middle line:90%
in Zaire.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And because it crashed
into the jungle,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.650 align:middle line:90%
the satellites couldn't find it.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So Stansfield Turner, he was
director of CIA at the time,

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:84%
turned a remote viewers
and targeted them

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:90%
on where did this plane go down.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we were able to
find out and get in there

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and get the plane
before the Russians did.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.681 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
like a super deal.

00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was
briefed all the way

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:90%
to Carter in the White House.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And we were told, you'll
never talk about this.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But then one time when President
Carter after he was out

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of office was addressing a
college group in Georgia,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:84%
somebody asked him what was one
of the more strange things that

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
happened as president--
kind of unexpected.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, once
we lost a plane in Zaire,

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:90%
and we couldn't find it.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA director
turned to remote viewers,

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and they found it.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:47.565 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
the story got out.

00:38:47.565 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it just coincidence that
former President Carter was

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.590 align:middle line:90%
on my plane the next day?

00:38:52.590 --> 00:39:03.470 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:84%
After more than two decades
of research and $20 million,

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the Cold War ended and the
CIA program was shut down.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But word had gotten out,
and today, in the US,

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:84%
there are thousands of people
practicing remote viewing

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:90%
professionally.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2003, in November,
on the 3rd of November,

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:10%
I asked 47 people who had come
to a college workshop that I

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:10%
taught on remote viewing.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They asked me we want to
do something important.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked them to describe
for me where Saddam Hussein was

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and what he would look like when
he was discovered by coalition

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:90%
or United States troops.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
What he would be wearing,
who would be with,

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:90%
what the place would look like.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.020 align:middle line:10%
They each gave me their
individual answers

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:10%
which by then analyzed.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.850 align:middle line:10%
They had a consensus view which
was that Saddam Hussein would

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:10%
be discovered in a compound
of a couple of houses

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:10%
near the city of Tikrit.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:10%
They said that there
would be a road running

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.460 align:middle line:10%
in front of the house and
a river would be behind it.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I did the analysis, and I
gave all the material over

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to the director of
the university who

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:84%
had it notarized and
put in a sealed envelope

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and put in a vault, which is
where it resides to this day.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And then we waited.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and
gentlemen, we got him!

00:40:39.559 --> 00:40:41.954 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS]

00:40:41.954 --> 00:40:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The reconstruction of
events as they would transpire

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:84%
on the 13th of December
was highly accurate.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Here is the drawing that was
released by the Pentagon.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, you see here, they
call it the Spider Hole there.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:90%
He was down there.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's the vent pipe, just
exactly the sort of thing

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:90%
that they described.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the air event and a
exhaust fan that had been built

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:84%
into the hole to allow
him to remain underground.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's the building above and
here's the little hidden place.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says here, here
he is crouched down here

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and here is the vent pipe.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.260 align:middle line:84%
He's like in a hidden
chamber it says.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Here's another one, and
she has drawn this building

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.520 align:middle line:84%
with this funny
little second story

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and with the big palm trees
at either end of the building.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.080 align:middle line:90%
The funny little second story--

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
well, here's the
actual building.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%
This was released by the
Provisional Authority

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.960 align:middle line:90%
that took over Iraq.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.960 align:middle line:84%
They said that he would only
have two or three people

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:84%
with him, that he would
look like a homeless person.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.980 align:middle line:84%
That he would have wild hair
and wild salt and pepper

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:90%
beard dressed in dark clothes.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That he would be
dispirited and dejected

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and would put up no resistance
even though he would be armed

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and that he would have a
large quantity of money.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So you would have a good case
to go and find Osama bin Laden.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I suppose one would
have a good case if the CIA

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.440 align:middle line:90%
were soliciting input.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know where
Osama bin Laden is?

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not answering a
question like that on tape,

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.668 align:middle line:90%
it would get me killed.

00:42:39.668 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
If I sense something like
that, I go to the authorities--

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:55.160 align:middle line:84%
without, I don't go
publicly with that.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Philosopher and
Parapsychologist Stephen

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.795 align:middle line:84%
Schwartz of the philosophical
Research Society in Los

00:43:00.795 --> 00:43:01.595 align:middle line:90%
Angeles.

00:43:01.595 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
He is determined to see that
psychic archeology is accepted

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:84%
as a modern
scientific discipline.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.380 align:middle line:84%
He has researched the
counts of psychic--

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I am interested in the
nature of consciousness.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And I got interested in
archeology as one of the ways

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I do research, partly
because so much of archeology

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.700 align:middle line:90%
depends on luck.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
We had a very skeptical
archeology department

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.430 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Alexandria.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we're not going

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:37.050 align:middle line:84%
to cooperate with you unless
you can find something,

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and we can control it
all the way through.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted to
find a buried building

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in a buried city that
had a tile floor.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So here's George McMullen
and I, and we're out

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.070 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the desert--

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:55.920 align:middle line:90%
where would you look?

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:90%
And we have to search about--

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about
1,500 square kilometers.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, after a while,
George made a location,

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and then we had Helen
do the same thing.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Then we bring George back in
and we literally say to him,

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.350 align:middle line:84%
now, you remember where we
started off in that big area.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Put a stake in the ground at
the corners of the building.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about that.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't be more
than a few inches off.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so then we dug
down, and there you

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.070 align:middle line:84%
see the walls
beginning to emerge.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:84%
He's 28 inches off out of
1,500 square kilometers.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:84%
There is
incontrovertible evidence

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that people have the
capacity to access

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
sense impressions
and information

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that they could not know through
the normal sensory channels.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
it is telling us

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that all consciousness
is interdependent and

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.210 align:middle line:90%
interconnected.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what-- for instance, the
Buddhists and Hindus and others

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:84%
have been telling us
for thousands of years.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.526 align:middle line:90%
>> What do think of this?

00:45:09.526 --> 00:45:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a good one.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.140 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine was
giving these kind

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.805 align:middle line:90%
of spoon bending parties.

00:45:14.805 --> 00:45:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And my little nine-year-old
daughter, my eldest daughter

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:90%
had this.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And she came back to
me after a few minutes,

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and she had curled up the bowl.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> These other things happened.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to my home and
a healer, a Tibetan healer,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:90%
was living with me.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:84%
He said you want to
see psycho-kinesis?

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.370 align:middle line:10%
And I said of course.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.050 align:middle line:10%
So he said take off your ring.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I took off my ring.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Took off my ring, he
said put it in your hand.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.620 align:middle line:90%
He said hold your hand out.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.230 align:middle line:84%
He went that over my
hand about three times.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what my ring
looked like after it.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was used--
it was even touched.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I just held it in my hand, and
he passed his hand over it.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Just this morning, I
was cleaning up my office

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and looking at this bent spoon
which was bent at a scientific

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.077 align:middle line:90%
conference that I was attending.

00:46:29.077 --> 00:46:30.660 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anybody
there who claimed

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:84%
to be psychic or
anything but funny things

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:36.960 align:middle line:84%
happen to occur around
this one psychiatrist.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is stuff that's
very hard to bend, OK?

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> If a six-year-old girl can
bend a spoon at a spoon bending

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.455 align:middle line:84%
party, then I needed to find a
man who invented these parties.

00:47:01.455 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he had to use some
force to get it to twist that

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.110 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But it had to be pretty soft
for him to be able to do it.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.727 align:middle line:84%
So it's partial,
it's maybe 90% PK.

00:47:19.727 --> 00:47:25.571 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.571 --> 00:47:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the PK party.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:38.118 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.118 --> 00:47:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Does everybody want
to bend tonight?

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah!

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to all
do this together now.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Get a point of concentration
above your head.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To do anything in PK,
you need to do three things.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:84%
First thing you do is you
focus your mind on what

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to affect.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The second step you
command what you want,

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.540 align:middle line:90%
what your intention is.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And the third step
is letting go.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When I count to three,
we'll all command it forcefully

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:90%
to bend--

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.872 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3.

00:48:21.872 --> 00:48:22.836 align:middle line:90%
Bend!

00:48:22.836 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Bend!

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.764 align:middle line:90%
Bend!

00:48:24.764 --> 00:48:25.564 align:middle line:90%
Bend!

00:48:25.564 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very skeptical about
any large claims of this type.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And I went to something called a
PK bending, metal bending party

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.890 align:middle line:84%
where people get
together to bend metal.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And I my intention
was to see somebody

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.720 align:middle line:84%
do something that
could not be done

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:84%
through the use
of ordinary force

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.566 align:middle line:90%
by trick or by any other means.

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I was
hoping to find was

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.790 align:middle line:84%
somebody who could take
the bowl of a soup spoon

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:53.840 align:middle line:90%
and bend it in half.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So I knew a woman
who was at this party

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and who had claimed to do
things like this in the past.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down within two feet
of her, watching her carefully,

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and was holding
a spoon of my own

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and was mimicking what
she was doing just

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to get a kinesthetic feel
for what was going on.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Buckle!

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Buckle, buckle, buckle.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I got to get
my brain out of the way.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So she was trying this for
a couple of minutes and I was

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.710 align:middle line:90%
watching her intently.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:29.951 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody behind
me said look what you did.

00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about me, what I had done.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I did is I had
bent the bowl of the spoon

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.527 align:middle line:90%
about 90 degrees over.

00:49:37.527 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
looked at my fingers

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.140 align:middle line:84%
to see if I had been applying
pressure because it would have

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:90%
let an indentation to do it.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't any
indication of that at all.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So someone said, well,
bend it all the way.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, so I just
pushed it with one finger,

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and it just went
all the way over.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It felt soft like taffy and
pinched over and immediately

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:03.214 align:middle line:84%
hardened up, and it's
been that way to this day.

00:50:03.214 --> 00:50:04.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Buckle!

00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:05.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Buckle.

00:50:05.118 --> 00:50:05.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Buckle!

00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:06.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Buckle.

00:50:06.546 --> 00:50:07.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:50:07.974 --> 00:50:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I hate to do it for people.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'd like to
do it for myself.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is it so quiet?

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.555 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:21.555 --> 00:50:22.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Do it.

00:50:22.355 --> 00:50:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, come on.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Do it, now come on.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Go!

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:38.996 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.996 --> 00:50:41.960 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS]

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.442 align:middle line:90%


00:50:43.442 --> 00:50:45.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey!

00:50:45.418 --> 00:50:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> How do I do that?

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Got my brain out of the way.

00:50:49.762 --> 00:50:51.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.414 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.414 --> 00:50:55.997 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, just all
of sudden I was just--

00:50:55.997 --> 00:50:58.680 align:middle line:90%


00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.460 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive feeling, kind
of like if make a jumper

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:84%
on shot on the basketball court
when playing a basketball game.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.722 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:51:06.722 --> 00:51:07.864 align:middle line:90%
>> In the the zone?

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:11.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly I used to be
able to there a lot faster.

00:51:11.998 --> 00:51:13.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you buckle?

00:51:13.339 --> 00:51:17.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with it from
a scientific point of view is

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:24.020 align:middle line:84%
it's extremely difficult to
capture this under conditions

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.524 align:middle line:84%
that are controlled well
enough so that you can provide

00:51:27.524 --> 00:51:29.690 align:middle line:84%
evidence to somebody else
to show that it looks like

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:32.194 align:middle line:84%
it's real because I can't
do that with my spoon.

00:51:32.194 --> 00:51:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even make
the claim of that.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect
anybody to believe it,

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:84%
but I have my own experience now
where I know I can believe it.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to the rules
of evidence and science,

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.660 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have much currency.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to a
personal experience,

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.230 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of currency.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Psycho-kinesis, or in short
PK, means mind over matter.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Can we humans through the
power of our mind's intention

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.210 align:middle line:90%
affect anything?

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Psycho-kinesis, the original
classical experiments used

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:07.100 align:middle line:90%
dice.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.650 align:middle line:10%
They were triggered by
professional gambler

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:10%
who came in to JB Ryan's
laboratory at Duke University

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.060 align:middle line:10%
once.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And said I'm a professional
gambler and I shoot craps

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and I make a good living at it,
but I read the statistics book

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.880 align:middle line:84%
recently and I found
that I can't possibly

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:84%
make the kind of living
I do without cheating.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.540 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.390 align:middle line:10%
And so they tested
it and asked him

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.640 align:middle line:10%
to will certain
dice face to come up

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.720 align:middle line:10%
that would make him win.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.180 align:middle line:10%
And he got them more
often than chance.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.700 align:middle line:10%
And this evolved into a
regular testing procedure

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.060 align:middle line:10%
where eventually machines
would throw these dice

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.300 align:middle line:10%
while people were told make
the sixes come up this time.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Now make the fives
come up this time.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, people got
scores different from chance

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.690 align:middle line:84%
enough to know that sometimes
the mind can reach out

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:57.050 align:middle line:84%
directly affect the state of
matter in these rolling dice.

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Nobody tests with
dice nowadays, they

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:84%
use fancy electronic
machines which

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:04.790 align:middle line:84%
are even harder to imagine what
in the world they could do.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:08.150 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists have created
ever more sophisticated methods

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.520 align:middle line:90%
of measuring chance.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.890 align:middle line:90%
First, they built this machine.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.940 align:middle line:10%
It takes 9000 plastic
marbles up a conveyor belt

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.580 align:middle line:10%
and then randomly drops them.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Normally, they fall into
a bell shaped curve.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So a scientist asked everyday
people, students and so forth,

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to mentally will more
balls to fall to the left

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.230 align:middle line:90%
or to fall to the right.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And they successfully
managed to do so.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Then they did the same test
with this swinging pendulum.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, people were
able to significantly

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.570 align:middle line:90%
increase or decrease its swing.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The issue is what kind of
control do we have to know

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.900 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.260 align:middle line:10%
So in the laboratory,
rather than in using spoons,

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.870 align:middle line:10%
we'll use something
more like a system which

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:10%
is extremely sensitive to
any type of external force

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:10%
like the movement of electrons.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
random number generator.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.040 align:middle line:84%
You can see it's a fairly
simple electrical circuit.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It goes through the serial
port of a personal computer.

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And all it's doing is randomly
flipping coins about 10,000

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.620 align:middle line:90%
a second.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Tests have shown that
in some mysterious way,

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:32.410 align:middle line:84%
the human mind can influence
this little machine to produce

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:36.880 align:middle line:84%
more 0s or more 1s and
shift it, ever so slightly,

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.010 align:middle line:84%
away from its normal
random course.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:84%
If one person can affect
a random number generator,

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:49.950 align:middle line:84%
scientists then wanted
to see what would

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:54.220 align:middle line:90%
happen with a group of people.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:58.000 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people who work in
context that involve groups--

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.910 align:middle line:10%
choruses or sports or
anything where you need

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.350 align:middle line:10%
to work with other people--

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:04.990 align:middle line:10%
occasionally will
report episodes

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:middle line:10%
when there seems to be a flow
in the group or the whole group

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.740 align:middle line:10%
gets into the zone, and
it just works better.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.360 align:middle line:10%
It works like a single
organism, and it feels good too.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And the question is,
well, what is that?

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.370 align:middle line:10%
Did something happen
psychologically that connected

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:10%
people, or is it something else?

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:28.800 align:middle line:10%
So one possibility is that the
group actually does gel way.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.836 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though it
becomes a single organism

00:55:31.836 --> 00:55:33.460 align:middle line:84%
as though there's a
moment in which you

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.860 align:middle line:84%
have random things that
sort of come together

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.790 align:middle line:90%
into a kind of order.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So late 1997, myself
and a few others

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.510 align:middle line:84%
were talking about these
experiments and saying, well,

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.630 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be interesting if we
could measure the entire world

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:53.350 align:middle line:90%
during large scale events.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:57.060 align:middle line:84%
This was after the funeral
of Princess Diana which

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.786 align:middle line:84%
was a worldwide event and
there are many more of these

00:55:59.786 --> 00:56:01.410 align:middle line:84%
now because of the
way the media works.

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We figured if we had random
number generators located

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.110 align:middle line:84%
around the world
running 24 hours a day

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.652 align:middle line:84%
that we may find that there's
a change in the randomness

00:56:17.652 --> 00:56:19.360 align:middle line:84%
during periods in
which people are paying

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.160 align:middle line:84%
very close attention to
one thing as compared

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:90%
to other times.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we've now been
running this for some years,

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.450 align:middle line:84%
we've had over
200 events so far.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And the odds against chance
of the change in randomness

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that we see is about
a million to one.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:43.840 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And so they discovered
something amazing--

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:48.820 align:middle line:10%
large group events
can mysteriously

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:10%
influence these random
number generators

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:55.810 align:middle line:10%
causing them to veer off
their usual random course.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.870 align:middle line:84%
This is Roger Nelson, who
was involved in the earliest

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:90%
mind over matter experiments.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Based here at
Princeton University,

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.580 align:middle line:84%
it was he who organized
his scientist friends

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.710 align:middle line:84%
into collecting random
number generator

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.170 align:middle line:90%
data from around the world.

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Thus, was born the Global
Consciousness Project.

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>> We have a huge database now
that includes events like New

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.670 align:middle line:10%
Years every year
when people gath--

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.805 align:middle line:10%
millions and millions of people,
or maybe billions actually,

00:57:24.805 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:10%
celebrate New Year's.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:32.344 align:middle line:90%
>> 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

00:57:32.344 --> 00:57:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Happy New Year!

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And people start
counting down.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:44.420 align:middle line:84%
They actually focus all together
on this very abstract moment.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.760 align:middle line:90%
So what we see in the data--

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.100 align:middle line:84%
just consider that we've
got a wandering data

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.550 align:middle line:84%
line that's a composite
across all the time zones

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.680 align:middle line:90%
and all of the REGs.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The data wander randomly
until about five minutes

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.550 align:middle line:84%
before midnight, and then
the variability decreases.

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:04.009 align:middle line:84%
And it minimizes around
midnight and then comes back up

00:58:04.009 --> 00:58:05.050 align:middle line:90%
and becomes normal again.

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:06.910 align:middle line:10%
We have a period of about--

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.750 align:middle line:10%
I think it's on the order of
10 minutes around midnight.

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:12.730 align:middle line:10%
It looks different
from random, and this

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:16.983 align:middle line:10%
is consistent enough from year
to year that it's significant.

00:58:16.983 --> 00:58:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:25.570 align:middle line:10%
We now have a continuous
record of 65 roughly

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:29.230 align:middle line:10%
of these devices producing
data from random generators

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.770 align:middle line:10%
scattered around the world,
24 hours a day, 7 days

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:34.410 align:middle line:10%
a week for years.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.300 align:middle line:84%
This is a little cloud, we'll
have to turn off very quickly.

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But the size of the bar and
that's loudness of the sound

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:46.100 align:middle line:84%
is an indication
of the noise level

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.410 align:middle line:90%
at the particular instrument.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Here's one in the Princeton,
there's one in Holland

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.720 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.770 align:middle line:84%
21,000, that's a
very big deviation.

00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:59.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:00.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you got one of those.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Now there are all
kinds of events.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.120 align:middle line:10%
There are tragedies, there are--

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.730 align:middle line:10%
wars start and wars end.

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:24.970 align:middle line:10%
And there are religious
celebrations of various kinds.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:29.140 align:middle line:10%
And we have found that if
there are large numbers--

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.660 align:middle line:10%
and that means something like
many hundreds of thousands

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.450 align:middle line:10%
in most cases or millions--

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:36.680 align:middle line:10%
who become engaged
in the same thing.

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they kind of
all point the same direction

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.270 align:middle line:84%
mentally and
emotionally, and then we

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:45.100 align:middle line:90%
register something in our data.

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:56.030 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Gradually, we've
come to understand

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that things that provoke or
embody or evoke compassion,

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.690 align:middle line:84%
love, deep feelings
of connectedness,

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.340 align:middle line:84%
the kind of thing
that really does

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.100 align:middle line:84%
represent the
interconnection of people.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Those are things that produce
most reliably big effects

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.370 align:middle line:84%
in our Global
Consciousness data.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:29.620 align:middle line:90%


01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a memorial to
the people from Princeton

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:35.660 align:middle line:90%
who were killed on 9/11.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 of them with their
names inscribed around there.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I love the bell it's
a beautiful found.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.950 align:middle line:90%


01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:50.810 align:middle line:90%
These are the names.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
13 people and Princeton is
just such a little place.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%


01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, we're just randomly
related to each other.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.940 align:middle line:10%
On 9/11, we were not
randomly related,

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:16.260 align:middle line:10%
we were focused
together on something

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:22.990 align:middle line:10%
that was shocking,
completely unbelievable.

01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It was just such a massive event
in our mental and emotional

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.970 align:middle line:90%
space.

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:32.500 align:middle line:90%


01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> How many other countries
are citizens here?

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Some think it was Americans.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
That's not true, 83 other
countries from around the world

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:43.180 align:middle line:90%
lost citizens here.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I look for the ones who
don't understand that ground

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.600 align:middle line:90%
zero looked like that on 9/11.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.610 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So here's what
the variance did.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
If you draw a picture of the
day of this variance, which

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
should normally just wander
is the kind of level trace,

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:08.130 align:middle line:90%
we get--

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
starting several hours,
about four or five hours

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.920 align:middle line:90%
before the first plane hit--

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge change where
the variance increases

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
tremendously and persistently
for six or eight hours.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.670 align:middle line:10%
After which, it then
decreases by a similar amount.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.100 align:middle line:10%
So we have a kind of a spike in
this variance measure on 9/11

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:33.090 align:middle line:10%
that's actually unique in
the history up to that time.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.630 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like the
system responded almost as

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:40.380 align:middle line:10%
if it was really
feeling the emotions

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.500 align:middle line:10%
and somehow responding to
the tragedy of the other day

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.140 align:middle line:10%
as people all over
the world were doing.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.950 align:middle line:90%
We became one.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:49.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Wake up now.

01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Grab a map, learn the facts.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It's free, it's free!

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But mostly, we're just
randomly related to each other.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
On 9/11, we couldn't do
anything but be together.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Say nothing you
say is the facts.

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There are lots of
mysteries in our data.

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It begins to change about 4
or 5 o'clock in the morning,

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's four or five hours
before the first plane hit.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.604 align:middle line:84%
Dean Radin's work is
about presentiment,

01:03:19.604 --> 01:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
they're beautiful
experiments that

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
show, in human beings, a
few seconds of presentiment

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.860 align:middle line:84%
before powerful
emotional events.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.810 align:middle line:10%
So maybe the global
consciousness

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:36.420 align:middle line:10%
had a presentiment about this
tremendous tragic or traumatic

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.882 align:middle line:10%
event in global consciousness.

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:44.080 align:middle line:90%


01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
This is purely what people
call hand-waving speculation,

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think that it may
be possible each of us

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
has what you might call
a consciousness field,

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:58.129 align:middle line:84%
is that our minds are
not confined our heads.

01:03:58.129 --> 01:03:59.420 align:middle line:90%
They extend out into the world.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%


01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.890 align:middle line:10%
Our consciousness fields,
if there is such a thing,

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:13.340 align:middle line:10%
could be a source for
the information that

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.750 align:middle line:10%
could be absorbed, could affect
an REG and change its behavior

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:21.458 align:middle line:10%
if we come together
as a global mind.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:25.450 align:middle line:90%


01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:27.550 align:middle line:10%
Effects we're talking
about are not really

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:31.210 align:middle line:10%
going to be useful for trying
to open your garage door

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.917 align:middle line:10%
or change your
television channel

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:35.333 align:middle line:10%
but the implications
are powerful.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:38.580 align:middle line:90%


01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
We are connected, not
only with each other

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.306 align:middle line:84%
but with the environment
that we live in.

01:04:44.306 --> 01:04:47.520 align:middle line:90%


01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
David Bloom, who is a highly
respected physicist, who

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
talked about the implicate order
and a kind of different way

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of looking at quantum mechanics.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
He spoke of a special
kind of information.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
He says this special
kind of information

01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is virtual normally,
but it's universal.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It's extended indefinitely
in time and space.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It's what people call
non-local information.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.350 align:middle line:10%
And we think that is the
same kind of information that

01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:20.190 align:middle line:10%
is responsible for the
interconnection of human beings

01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:22.674 align:middle line:10%
or of us with our environment.

01:05:22.674 --> 01:05:24.840 align:middle line:10%
The same kind of information
that makes a difference

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.820 align:middle line:10%
to the REG's.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:31.200 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, this active
information can be actualised,

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.040 align:middle line:10%
can become real in the world
if there's a need for it.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.420 align:middle line:10%
So, an example, that's pretty
easy for most people to accept

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.640 align:middle line:10%
is healing.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
The healer has the information,
the healee needs it.

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And the two create a
kind of opportunity.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:06:06.340 align:middle line:90%


01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Via friend, I heard about
a woman who has miraculously

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
cured through a psychic
healing in Brazil.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I was very ill.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I had three bowel resection
operations that had failed.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up with
a leaking bowel

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
which affected me
very badly in the fact

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had a lot of
toxins in my system.

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I had skin problems,
open sores all over.

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was desperate.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.290 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely desperate.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I heard of John of God in
Brazil, and I went over there.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Seven months
after her return,

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:47.320 align:middle line:90%
she was completely cured.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My liver was
completely healed.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.640 align:middle line:90%
The cells had regenerated.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
My colon was functioning for
the first time in my life.

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd heard so much about it,
and then this patient of mine

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:00.820 align:middle line:90%
came back.

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd really like
to see what's going on.

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>> John of God works for free.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.150 align:middle line:90%
He says he has a spirit medium.

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
He goes into a trance
and spirit entities work

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
through him to enable him
to operate on his patients.

01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:20.710 align:middle line:90%


01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> He's very open to medical
people or doctors watching

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.730 align:middle line:90%
close at what he does.

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, they actually ask
the doctor and the audience

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.100 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So it was myself and
the lady from Germany,

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and I filmed some
of the surgeries

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
from close up, from
one meter away.

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
In 20 odd years that he's
been working in the cause,

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.450 align:middle line:90%
he works with his bare hands.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And he uses a knife, like an
ordinary kitchen knife that's

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.030 align:middle line:90%
definitely not sterile.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't had one
case of infection--

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.060 align:middle line:90%
not one.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard
anybody scream so there

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
is no pain or relatively
very little discomfort.

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:01.477 align:middle line:90%


01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The surgery that
he does the nurse

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
with the forceps,
the long forceps,

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
it goes right to the
back of the sinus.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And he would twist
the forceps around

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.915 align:middle line:84%
and he would actually
pull out a tumor.

01:08:12.915 --> 01:08:15.500 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.144 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know
how to explain that.

01:08:18.144 --> 01:08:23.279 align:middle line:84%
That you don't cause tremendous
damage is beyond any belief.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.899 align:middle line:84%
>> I know this is a
controversial issue but would

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
you send a patient
to a psychic healer?

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when the patients being
told by the specialists that

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing more they
can do for him or her,

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.680 align:middle line:84%
then I feel I can actually
suggest something like that.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not important to me
actually how it happens or why

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
it happens or to find an
intellectual explanation

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
because you won't.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you do that will
bring about healing that's

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.937 align:middle line:90%
not harmful, I will support.

01:08:53.937 --> 01:09:06.660 align:middle line:90%


01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout the
history of mankind,

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
many spiritual healing
methods have been based

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.899 align:middle line:84%
on the transference
of a universal,

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.880 align:middle line:90%
all pervading energy.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese call qi, the
Japanese ki, and the Indians

01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:22.819 align:middle line:90%
call it prana.

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
They say this lifeforce
runs deep in our bodies

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.260 align:middle line:84%
through invisible
lines called meridians.

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%


01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.620 align:middle line:90%
In China, they practice qigong.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
They say this works
the lifeforce energy,

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:44.304 align:middle line:84%
promotes help, and
prevents disease.

01:09:44.304 --> 01:09:46.859 align:middle line:90%


01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:48.960 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese say
illness occurs when

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
there is a blockage of energy.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Here at a hospital
in China, students

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:57.990 align:middle line:84%
use qigong to make a
cancerous more disappear.

01:09:57.990 --> 01:10:58.630 align:middle line:90%


01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese are
not too caught up

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
in theories about how
qigong healing might work.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.210 align:middle line:84%
They say the intellect can't
understand how it works.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
More importantly than how
it works is what it does.

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But in Western science,
we don't think like that.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
We want to analyze and prove
these mysterious things.

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:23.050 align:middle line:10%
At the University of Arizona,
Professor Gary Schwartz

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:25.450 align:middle line:10%
and his team are doing
scientific research

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:28.060 align:middle line:10%
into consciousness and healing.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I began as an
electrical engineer,

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and I understand how
literally our anatomy,

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
we serve as an antenna for
electromagnetic signals,

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and we also generate
electromagnetic signals.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And once you think of the
body in terms of electronics

01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic fields
and resonance and interaction,

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:54.195 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of energy healing
becomes completely plausibly.

01:11:54.195 --> 01:11:57.310 align:middle line:90%


01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> After my breast
cancer surgery,

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
when I had a lumpectomy and
some lymph nodes removed,

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.820 align:middle line:90%
and I was in so much pain.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.740 align:middle line:10%
I thought at the time
I had never known pain

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.650 align:middle line:10%
like that in my entire life.

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:11.410 align:middle line:10%
And they had given
me tons of morphine,

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:12.760 align:middle line:10%
tons of every kind of drug.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm allergic to all
kinds of medicines

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and nothing was touching it.

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And Rebecca showed up,
and I don't believe you

01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:21.130 align:middle line:90%
left for two hours, did you?

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You were there for two
hours, weren't you?

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> About that, yeah.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But within five minutes
with therapeutic touch,

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
we were able to get her
pain level to nothing.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
We're not doing the healing,
but we are facilitating.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
We're the conduits.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Generally, it's just
universal energy.

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:44.650 align:middle line:10%
And the way that
it is for me is I

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:47.320 align:middle line:10%
draw the energy
through my crown,

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.660 align:middle line:10%
filling my body with this
calm sense of peace, love.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Coming from a place of
compassion, the energy--

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.150 align:middle line:90%
the hands and heart connected.

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The energy then flows
through the heart

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
through the hands
to the individual.

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We have electromagnetic
signals running between

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
our brains and our bodies that
circulate through the liquids

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:15.170 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
blood, for example,

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is a very good conductor
of electricity.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.542 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, for example,
the energy from the heart--

01:13:22.542 --> 01:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
literally the electrical energy
from the heart or the EKG--

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
can be picked up from
any part of the body

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
because the electrical
signal from the heart

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
goes down to the toes
to the top of the head.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.978 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's the same
thing with the brain.

01:13:33.978 --> 01:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The brain generates an
EEG, that EEG signal

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.362 align:middle line:84%
travels the bloodstream and
you can easily measure that.

01:13:39.362 --> 01:13:42.130 align:middle line:90%


01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Schwartz found
evidence that healers emit

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:49.390 align:middle line:84%
highly ordered invisible light
waves and produce an extra

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:52.000 align:middle line:90%
surge of electrostatic energy.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> This is an AC Gauss meter.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
AC Gauss meters are extremely
standard piece of equipment.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
we're looking at a thing

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.340 align:middle line:90%
called the universal qi point.

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And the universal qi point
is about here in the hand.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
That qi point was
actually well-understood

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
in Chinese medicine.

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
There is an equivalent,
for example, in Ayurveda.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.200 align:middle line:84%
There are equivalents
in many of--

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, the ancient
Celtic traditions

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.910 align:middle line:90%
of laying on of hands healing.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So that point in
esoteric knowledge

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
is well recognized
and understood.

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:44.370 align:middle line:90%


01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In our laboratory, we have
done many different kinds

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
of experiments.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
We've measured the
effects of energy healing

01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:54.180 align:middle line:84%
on E coli bacteria,
bacteria in test tubes.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at the effects of
energy healing, such as Reiki,

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
on rats that were
stressed with noise

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and actually measuring
the microvascular changes

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:05.500 align:middle line:90%
in their gut.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We've known for years now
that the power of belief is

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.510 align:middle line:90%
very strong in healing.

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Tests with placebo
medicines have

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
shown that 33% of all people
are healed because they

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.650 align:middle line:90%
believe they will be.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:26.240 align:middle line:90%


01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
However, these tests
with Reiki on rats

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
prove the point that
belief aside, Reiki

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
works because who knows
what rats believe?

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.840 align:middle line:90%


01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We've done experiments
on the effects of healing

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
on the longevity of leaves
that have been caught.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Please do not work on
the control leaf at any time

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.560 align:middle line:90%
in this process.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
No matter how it
feels inside, I need

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:51.680 align:middle line:90%
you to hold that very cleanly.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:16:02.990 align:middle line:90%


01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a complete trial
that's ongoing at this point.

01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:14.630 align:middle line:10%
Leaves that are at day 58
in the ongoing process,

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:21.500 align:middle line:10%
they have received four 10
minute healings every 24 hours.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.920 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice there are
a number of control pots

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that no longer have
leaves in them.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
In this particular trial, we
had one practitioner drop out.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The other nine pairs, all of
the leaves are still alive.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>> We didn't know how long this
process would last and today is

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.650 align:middle line:10%
day 58 of this particular trial.

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:49.930 align:middle line:10%
And my leaf is still
alive at day 58,

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:52.340 align:middle line:10%
my control leaf is
no longer with us.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:56.316 align:middle line:90%


01:16:56.316 --> 01:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Any time I go up, you know I
go like this and they will ask

01:16:59.270 --> 01:17:00.860 align:middle line:90%
me why I'm doing I'm Jewish.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.235 align:middle line:84%
And it's too difficult
to do this all the time.

01:17:03.235 --> 01:17:06.526 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:06.526 --> 01:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on from that,
and we'll come back.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
What are we doi--

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.916 align:middle line:84%
are we reaching the
bottom of the bucket here?

01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:12.128 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.086 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, show me.

01:17:14.086 --> 01:17:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's see, I could bring
this arm all the way to here,

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:18.140 align:middle line:90%
but I can't--

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I see what you mean.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.332 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's play with that.

01:17:20.332 --> 01:17:21.024 align:middle line:90%
You want to do that?

01:17:21.024 --> 01:17:21.485 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:17:21.485 --> 01:17:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Come on, you've
got nothing to lose.

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:24.579 align:middle line:90%
>> It's from scar tissue.

01:17:24.579 --> 01:17:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Come around this
way, if you want.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Or that way, or
any way you want.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.794 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving my hands
around a little bit, just

01:17:31.794 --> 01:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to find where I
feel it the most.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I sort of
pull out a little,

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
because that helps me kind
of feel it a little bit more.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:40.920 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So that spot makes the
fingers move a little bit.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I listen, I feel, I bring
my hands in until I get a sense

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.360 align:middle line:90%
of something.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I feel it, I refine it
into the center of my palm.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.720 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I pull out to feel
the interesting sensation

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.530 align:middle line:10%
of the draw or the stretching
against the inside of the palm

01:17:58.530 --> 01:17:59.410 align:middle line:10%
and back.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I simply play with it, and
I observe how other people's

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.000 align:middle line:90%
bodies respond as I feel.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
confluence of the energies

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or more than the energies
of the frequencies

01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and beyond that come together
and create something more.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It's more than being
just a conduit.

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:23.675 align:middle line:84%
We're actually a
catalyst for change.

01:18:23.675 --> 01:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> This arm go up
over your head again.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.168 align:middle line:90%
Reach over.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:30.072 align:middle line:90%


01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:33.488 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:33.488 --> 01:18:36.910 align:middle line:90%


01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And in all these different
areas and preparations,

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:44.320 align:middle line:84%
we find evidence for
the power of intention.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And the focusing of one's
attention with that intention

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
seems to be an important
parameter in terms

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
of determining the magnitude of
the effects that are obtained.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, actually I want
to see the other one.

01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's actually looser
than the other one.

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:08.660 align:middle line:90%


01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We've done experiments on
the effects of distant healing

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:18.410 align:middle line:84%
on the biophoton release
or inhibition that occurs

01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:19.250 align:middle line:90%
in plants.

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
all living things

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:24.569 align:middle line:84%
generate invisible light that
is visible to the naked eye.

01:19:24.569 --> 01:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
a healer can actually

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
affect or increase or decrease
the amount of light that's

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.305 align:middle line:90%
taking place.

01:19:30.305 --> 01:19:31.471 align:middle line:90%
>> You take the leaves home?

01:19:31.471 --> 01:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I leaves stay
here and I go home.

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I spend
the next x number

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
of days running the energy for
10 minutes four times a day.

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:47.250 align:middle line:90%


01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We just completed an
experiment where a group of 400

01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
plus people in London saw
one of two leaves in Tucson.

01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:59.630 align:middle line:84%
We did not know which
leaf was picked.

01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Each leaf, geranium
leaf, had 16 holes in it,

01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:09.420 align:middle line:10%
16 spots where the intention
to glow might enhance it.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And then for 10 minutes, one
of those two leaves were picked

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.100 align:middle line:90%
and they watched.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
On the screen, the leaf and
sent glowing instructions

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to the leaf.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.970 align:middle line:10%
And then when we
analyzed the data,

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:25.170 align:middle line:10%
much to my great surprise,
not only was the leaf that

01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:27.450 align:middle line:10%
was picked for the
glowing instructions

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:29.160 align:middle line:10%
could you see literally
the spots where

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.770 align:middle line:10%
the injuries occurred were
literally glowing more,

01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:34.847 align:middle line:10%
you could see it with the naked
eye and between the two images

01:20:34.847 --> 01:20:35.680 align:middle line:10%
there was an effect.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:54.330 align:middle line:90%


01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a photograph of
photonic emissions from a human

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.070 align:middle line:90%
fingertip.

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Light is present in
plants and all beings.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It is a source of energy.

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
When we eat, we take in tiny
light particles called photons.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.480 align:middle line:84%
We store these photons in
the cells of our bodies.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Photons are quantum
particles of light.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
They collide, exchange
information, bounce apart,

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and stay mysteriously
connected at a distance.

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:26.370 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics, this
is called entanglement.

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:30.209 align:middle line:10%
I wonder, is this how healing
and distant healing works?

01:21:30.209 --> 01:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that when
you look at the totality

01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:35.070 align:middle line:84%
of our research combined
with other people's research,

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:38.040 align:middle line:84%
the conclusion is quite
clear that healing can occur

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.280 align:middle line:84%
in a distance, that
consciousness can have effects

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.300 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.601 align:middle line:84%
How that works and the
conditions under that works,

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:46.600 align:middle line:90%
that's another question.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.220 align:middle line:90%


01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Many universities are
skeptical of this kind of work

01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and there are many faculty
within my own university

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that are skeptical
of this research.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.020 align:middle line:84%
However, the fact
is that this work

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
has been funded by NIH, the
National Institutes of Health.

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's published in peer
reviewed journals.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.890 align:middle line:10%
The studies are very
carefully conducted,

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:12.050 align:middle line:10%
and the findings
are very robust--

01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:12.850 align:middle line:10%
they are real.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:17.800 align:middle line:90%


01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
What I find fantastic
is just with,

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.420 align:middle line:90%
quote, "normal energies"--

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Just normal radio
electromagnetics

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.254 align:middle line:84%
and normal light
frequencies, we've

01:22:25.254 --> 01:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
got more than enough power
to be able to communicate

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
from one side of the
planet to the other

01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to do so, quote,
"virtually instantaneously."

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So just working within,
quote, "conventional physics,"

01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and then and quantum
physics, you've

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.420 align:middle line:84%
already got all kinds
of power for virtually

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.544 align:middle line:84%
every psychic phenomena
that's ever been reported.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:53.990 align:middle line:90%


01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm on my way to
Dr. Larry Dossey,

01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.228 align:middle line:84%
who comes from a traditional
Western medicine background.

01:23:00.228 --> 01:23:05.000 align:middle line:90%


01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
However, he has become
internationally renowned

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.444 align:middle line:84%
for advocating the role of
spirituality in health care.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%


01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.625 align:middle line:84%
He lives in Santa
Fe, New Mexico.

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%


01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in Vietnam as a
battalion surgeon in 1968

01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and 1969 and was out in the
front lines and saw a good deal

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of combat experience and
a lot of blood and gore

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.400 align:middle line:90%
as a battalion surgeon.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I was awarded
medals for my participation

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.290 align:middle line:90%
as a surgeon in that conflict.

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%


01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:58.970 align:middle line:10%
Beginning in my first
year of medical practice,

01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:03.990 align:middle line:10%
I saw a particular case
which changed my way

01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:06.480 align:middle line:10%
of thinking about these things.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.760 align:middle line:10%
I had a patient who was elderly.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.770 align:middle line:10%
He had lung cancer
in both lungs.

01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:13.860 align:middle line:90%
He was dying.

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.380 align:middle line:90%
He did not want any treatment.

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, there was
no good treatment anyway.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
All he wanted to do was to
go home from the hospital

01:24:21.810 --> 01:24:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to die at home.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
The only treatment he had, if
you can consider it therapy,

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
is that people from his
church came to his bedside day

01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:33.840 align:middle line:90%
after day and prayed for him.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So I sent him home
as he wanted to do,

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and I was convinced
that he would

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.340 align:middle line:90%
be dead in a couple of days.

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
A year later, I couldn't
believe he was still alive.

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I went down to the
radiology department,

01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
looked at his new
chest X-ray, put it

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
alongside the old one, which
had lung cancer throughout,

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.770 align:middle line:90%
but the new one was normal.

01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The only therapy this man
had, if you consider it that,

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:58.440 align:middle line:90%
was prayer.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was astonished by that.

01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
At that point in my life was not
ready to accept that prayer did

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.260 align:middle line:84%
anything, I just called
it a spontaneous remission

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and let it go at that.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.089 align:middle line:84%
But that was seared
into my brain,

01:25:11.089 --> 01:25:12.130 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't forget it.

01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And years later when the studies
came out supporting prayer,

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought back
about that and began

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to ask questions about that.

01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I began to look at surveys of
patients whose diseases simply

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.080 align:middle line:90%
went away.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.050 align:middle line:10%
And one of the questions that
these patients were asked

01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:34.800 align:middle line:10%
was what do you think
accounted for the disappearance

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.490 align:middle line:10%
of your illness.

01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Most of these people
would say, well,

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:41.370 align:middle line:10%
it had something to
do with my thought,

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:45.510 align:middle line:10%
the way I chose to live my life.

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:48.900 align:middle line:10%
Most of them would list some
sort of spiritual practice,

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.290 align:middle line:10%
such as prayer.

01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:54.680 align:middle line:10%
75% say that prayer accounted
for why they got well,

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.320 align:middle line:10%
but others would list
things like music,

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.360 align:middle line:10%
doing mental imagery.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.580 align:middle line:10%
It's almost embarrassing
about the variety

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.330 align:middle line:10%
of things people described.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:36.930 align:middle line:90%


01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics say there
is no evidence.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.400 align:middle line:90%
This is profoundly wrong.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.180 align:middle line:10%
Currently, there
are about 21 major

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.300 align:middle line:10%
what we call a randomized,
double blind controlled studies

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:53.220 align:middle line:10%
looking at the role of
healing intentions or prayer,

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.480 align:middle line:10%
if you will.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.450 align:middle line:84%
People call this
by different terms.

01:26:57.450 --> 01:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, in the Western
world, most people

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
associate prayer with a
religion and with a deity,

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.660 align:middle line:90%
but this is not true.

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.298 align:middle line:84%
If you look at other spiritual
traditions around the world.

01:27:08.298 --> 01:27:41.034 align:middle line:90%


01:27:41.034 --> 01:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Built in the early 1800s,
The Santuario de Chimayo

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.650 align:middle line:90%
is about 30 miles north of here.

01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:52.810 align:middle line:84%
People attribute all sorts of
healing powers to not the water

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:57.580 align:middle line:84%
as at Lourdes, but to the dirt
outside this little church.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So people go and
they get the dirt,

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and they rub it over the area
of the body that needs healing.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I was at that little
church one day

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and a woman came in, an
elderly Hispanic woman.

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
We struck up a conversation,
and she told me

01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:16.420 align:middle line:84%
years before she had come
there in a wheelchair.

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And she prayed to the
Virgin of Guadalupe

01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and something happened.

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to get out of
her wheelchair and walk away.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So she left her wheelchair
there in gratitude,

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.050 align:middle line:84%
like people leave crutches
at Lourdes and so on.

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And so she made an annual
pilgrimage every year

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to express gratitude
for her healing.

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
She just took it as
a matter of fact.

01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:42.820 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't surprised.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Many people here who have
fantastic faith in the Virgin

01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
think that this just sort
of goes with the territory.

01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:56.270 align:middle line:90%


01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the prevalent
idea is that good doctors,

01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:04.500 align:middle line:84%
scientifically oriented doctors
don't believe any of this.

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.780 align:middle line:84%
That happens to be
a false picture.

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We know that because of surveys
that have been recently done.

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The best one came
three years ago,

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and it looked over 1,000
physicians around the United

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.500 align:middle line:84%
States asking them their beliefs
about prayer, remote healing,

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:27.690 align:middle line:10%
75% of these physicians
said that they

01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:30.900 align:middle line:10%
believe that spiritual beliefs
can help people get well.

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:35.700 align:middle line:10%
74% said that they think
prayer can work at a distance.

01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.600 align:middle line:10%
And 55% said they
had actually seen

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.770 align:middle line:10%
results in their own
patients that resembled

01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:45.630 align:middle line:10%
what they call miracles.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This is not the picture
people have of doctors.

01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's the explanatory
factor here.

01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:53.640 align:middle line:10%
If you ask doctors
publicly what they believe,

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.700 align:middle line:10%
they will just deny
that this stuff is real.

01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.330 align:middle line:10%
But if you ask them anonymously
on surveys where they do not

01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:04.770 align:middle line:10%
have to sign their name, you get
a completely different picture.

01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:07.520 align:middle line:90%


01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:13.570 align:middle line:84%
These are some benches crafted
for a meditation sitting

01:30:13.570 --> 01:30:14.982 align:middle line:90%

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
with many Native American
healers and shamans

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
about what they think about
prayer and intentionality.

01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken for
granted in their tradition

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.680 align:middle line:90%
that these things are real.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:55.720 align:middle line:84%

we have lost touch with this.

area where I live whether or not

01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
she believe in prayer, she
said oh, don't ask me that.

01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%

a word for prayer.

We know in modern
medicine that many things

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:34.110 align:middle line:84%
work, although we don't have
an understanding of how.

01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:middle line:84%
A classic example is
the general anesthetics.

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
anesthesia really works,

01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:40.990 align:middle line:90%
but we know that it does.

01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So we use it in spite of our
ignorance about how it happens.

01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%

the same juncture

Although there are around 20
major hypotheses about how

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.180 align:middle line:90%
it works, there's no consensus.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:01.120 align:middle line:10%
But almost all of
these hypotheses

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.810 align:middle line:10%
suggest we're going to have
to redefine consciousness.

01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to free it
from the brain, from the body,

01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and distribute it, what
I call, non-locally

01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:14.950 align:middle line:90%
out there in the world.

we use the term consciousness
because it's not

01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:30.240 align:middle line:90%
properly defined.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
in science you have

01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to allow a term to
float in ambiguity,

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and you understand its
meaning as you go along.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And you study how it
manifests in the world,

01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
then you eventually
can define it.

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:07.870 align:middle line:84%
other and not directly
facing the core issue.

01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The core issue is
that most scientists

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.970 align:middle line:84%
are totally married to
an absolute materialist

01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
philosophy of mind,
which says the mind is

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.450 align:middle line:84%
nothing but chemical
and electrical activity

01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:22.800 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't reach out
beyond your body.

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:27.520 align:middle line:90%
It dies when you die.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think it's so
important to bring PSI in.

01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
If materialism is right and
the core basis of spirituality

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.990 align:middle line:84%
is nonsense, the
two are never going

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to help each other it's going
to be a continual fight.

01:33:44.650 --> 01:33:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But if as I see it that when
you apply essential science

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and you discover
these PSI phenomena

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and you find that the mind can
reach beyond the body, that,

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, it survives
death in some form,

01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that we can have
interconnections that are

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.550 align:middle line:90%
extremely deep and pervasive--

01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that's much more what genuine
spirituality is about.

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
marriage between science

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
needs to take place.

>> Spoon bending is a very
interesting phenomenon.

01:34:43.907 --> 01:34:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Because, first of
all, there are a lot

01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
of people who just
do it as a trick.

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's eliminate
the tricksters,

01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:52.660 align:middle line:84%
let's eliminate the
charlatans, and let's

01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:55.990 align:middle line:84%
talk about the conditions where
a person can, for example,

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:59.420 align:middle line:90%
very gently stroke--

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.670 align:middle line:84%
no force whatsoever,
just a gentle stroking.

01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it will be observed
to bend, and the question

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.880 align:middle line:90%
is, how does that happen?

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we remember
that any object is

01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:18.500 align:middle line:84%
99.9 percent empty
space, this is mostly

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.470 align:middle line:90%
empty space such as this.

01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And what preserves this
space is a particular lattice

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.210 align:middle line:90%
or a structure that is held.

01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But since this
structure is mostly

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.780 align:middle line:84%
thin air with the
right intention

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and the right resonance,
it is possible to then,

01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, commune
with the atoms.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, get into its
residence so that very little,

01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:50.390 align:middle line:84%
quote, "power" allows for
it to become, if you would,

01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:52.790 align:middle line:90%
more liquid or more malleable.

01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
with some objects

01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:59.120 align:middle line:84%
more easily than others, but
it becomes completely plausible

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.206 align:middle line:84%
once you look at this as a
quantum physics phenomena.

01:36:02.206 --> 01:36:13.450 align:middle line:90%


01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:16.840 align:middle line:84%

And so I know that a lot
of the popular new age

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:25.510 align:middle line:10%
writings that invoke
quantum physics as sort

01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:29.090 align:middle line:10%
of a rationale for psychic
and spiritual things,

01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:30.550 align:middle line:10%
they're really being poetic.

01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:32.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's kind of
beautiful in a way,

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.400 align:middle line:10%
but quantum physics
is not poetry .

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.470 align:middle line:90%

01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:40.960 align:middle line:84%
are we really going
anywhere or are

for how does PSI operates.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I can speculate, but it'd be
too strong a statement to say

01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's specifically
linked to, say, zero point

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
energy or vacuum fluctuations,
but it's still too early

01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:08.260 align:middle line:90%
to really understand.

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even now, we know that
dark energy is some 70 plus

percent of the universe.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Dark matter appears
to be some 20 plus

01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:19.180 align:middle line:90%
percent of the universe.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:23.680 align:middle line:84%
You add it all up, it turns
out that 4% of the universe we

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:28.640 align:middle line:84%
understand, 96% of the
universe, we don't have a clue.

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So facing that kind
of reality, one

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:37.200 align:middle line:84%
must be very cautious about
saying something can't be.

organizing, designing process--

Most of the pioneering
scientists I met

01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
challenged the prevailing
materialistic world view

01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that our mind is just
limited to our brain.

01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:33.850 align:middle line:10%
Their research demonstrates
that sometimes there

01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:35.590 align:middle line:10%
is an aspect of
our consciousness

01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:38.830 align:middle line:10%
that transcends space
and time, that transcends

01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:41.050 align:middle line:10%
the limits of our
physical senses,

01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:43.840 align:middle line:10%
that we can influence
our physical world,

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.955 align:middle line:10%
and that we are
mysteriously interconnected.

by my daughter's dream,

my father's accident, and the

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to a point where I can
confidently say that I have not

01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:12.130 align:middle line:84%
been deluding myself, that
paranormal actually seems

01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:14.690 align:middle line:90%
normal.

01:41:14.690 --> 01:41:16.130 align:middle line:90%
But still, I wonder--

01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:19.760 align:middle line:84%
did I, in the process, just
find scientific evidence

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.080 align:middle line:90%
for our divinity or for spirit?

to me that sounds a lot like
the ideas of the spirit.

That doesn't mean that the
Catholics are completely right

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:45.980 align:middle line:10%
or the Baptist are completely
right or the Buddhists

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.320 align:middle line:10%
or something like
that, but it does

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.540 align:middle line:10%
mean there is a reality
behind spiritual systems

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:56.600 align:middle line:10%
that very much
deserves our attention.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.086 align:middle line:84%
That's the importance of psychic
phenomena and the big five.

exactly what the religious

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.510 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of epiphany,
and it is what the genius

experiences at the "aha"
