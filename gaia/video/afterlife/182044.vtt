>> Oh my.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I believe
in life after life.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.864 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, what do you
think happens when you die?

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that you go to heaven
and that the Lord accepts you.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And your body's
still here on Earth,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:90%

after death necessarily.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I do think there's a
lot we don't understand.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there life after life?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I really don't feel that there's
any way that we could possibly

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:90%
know until we're there.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I definitely believe
that our soul is a very

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.143 align:middle line:90%
powerful emotional thing.

00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
believe that when

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
our body dies that
that's the end.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe
in life after life?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.188 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, yeah.

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
family members that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.535 align:middle line:84%
have had experiences with people
coming back after they've died.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I do.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think the
nature of the afterlife is?

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.647 align:middle line:84%
I feel like people, maybe
their spirits still exist

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:20.521 align:middle line:84%
and they're just kind of
with the people they love.

>> There are a
million ways to die.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps two million.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps even more.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we don't even know
how many ways there are to die.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we do know
is that a high percentage

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of those who die have
what is commonly known

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:90%
as a near-death experience.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Many people report
going up a tunnel

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and seeing heavenly bodies
bathed in bright light.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And a good number
see their life flash

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
before them in a life
review, and even enter

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:90%
a heavenly realm.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We have many representations
of near-death experiences

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Artists down through
history and in every culture

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
have been there to record
these heavenly encounters.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It's as though mankind takes
a common path to heaven

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and always has.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I know all about
near-death experiences

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
because I have written about
them, nine books and all,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
with a number of the
field's top researchers.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I have looked at death in many
ways and in many cultures.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Yet, funny thing,
in all the years

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
I have studied and
written about death,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I have rarely thought that
it would ever happen to me.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time I thought
that I would always

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
be here, a permanent
inhabitant of the living world.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:90%
What was it Sigmund Freud said?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
"When we attempt
to imagine death,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
we perceive ourselves
as spectators."

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Like most everyone else, I, too,
imagined myself as a spectator.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I hid behind my writing,
safe from mortality.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I had a box seat in the stadium
of mankind, an eternal observer

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:90%
in the game of life.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Then reality paid me a visit.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful day with
spectacular light and clean air

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
it was, as they say,
a good day to die.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I was out taking a walk
in the desert, when

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere, my heart
began to race fast and hard

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:90%
like a runaway engine.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Before long, I was down and out.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
In a lucid moment, I realized
that I could easily become

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:90%
the subject of my own work.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I imagined what that would
be like by remembering

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
stories used in the
books I had written.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
No longer did I believe
that the only thing

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.275 align:middle line:84%
wrong with immortality was
that it goes on forever

00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
or that it was a fate
worse than death.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted real answers to
the age old question--

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%
what happens when we die?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I decided to go to people who
knew firsthand what happens--

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:90%
near-death experiencers.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Accidents or illness
had brought these people

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:90%
to the brink of death.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
They had looked
down into the abyss

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and found it to be, well,
quite pleasant actually.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
If not, why were they
laughing all the time?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I also went to researchers
who had analyzed thousands

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
of these near-death
experiences and who

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
had come up with some amazing
conclusions about God, heaven,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and the afterlife.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
These were guys I had
written books with.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Funny, isn't it?

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I always thought I was
writing those books

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:90%
for other people, not myself.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And then I talked to
people all over the country

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:10%
and from all walks
of life just to see

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:10%
what the person on
the street thought

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:10%
about death and the hereafter.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Their answers were proof that
I was not the only one thinking

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:90%
about the big question.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't really believe in any
kind of afterlife of any kind.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I think when you die,
you go back to wherever

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:90%
you were before you were born.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.047 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope that you go to heaven.

00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
I think that you do.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.547 align:middle line:84%
I never thought there
was anything wrong

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
with just at least believing
that you go to heaven.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
do you any harm.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:90%
So I hope so.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that we're
spiritual beings that

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
have existed before this time
and exists beyond this time,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and this just
happens to be where

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.728 align:middle line:90%
we're most aware of right now.

00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I really don't agree with
the whole life after death thing

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
because if it really
was life after death,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
what's the point of
even being alive?

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there's
some sort of afterlife.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Your spirit goes somewhere.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.864 align:middle line:90%
Honestly, I don't know really.

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:47.292 align:middle line:90%

>> In order to get a modern
day impression of this subject,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:10%
it is best to spend time with
the scientists who are studying

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:10%
this phenomena now.

Perhaps the best
scientific work is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:90%
being done by Dr. Jeffrey Long.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
We co-wrote the book "Evidence
of the Afterlife," which

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is filled with his
astounding findings

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:90%
about death and the beyond.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did say beyond.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:84%
As the founder of the Near-death
Experience Research Foundation,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
also known as
NDERF, Dr. Long has

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
investigated thousands of
near-death experience case

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
studies worldwide.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:90%
His conclusion?

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
There is most
definitely an afterlife.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>> The question, that really
important question of what

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:10%
happens when we die, I certainly
have my opinion and have not

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:10%
been shy about
sharing that opinion.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I think there is an
afterlife for all of us,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
afterlife is wonderful.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
even more important

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.282 align:middle line:90%
is why I believe that.

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:90%
What evidence is there?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
What is that line of thinking?

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:90%
What is that chain of evidence?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
What have we consistently
observed in multiple studies,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
including the NDERF study,
that leads me to believe that?

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's those nine
lines of evidence that,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:10%
to me personally, are
compelling evidence that we all

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:10%
are going to have an afterlife,
that that is something that we

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:10%
are all going to experience.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:10%
Our consciousness,
who we are, is going

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:10%
to survive our bodily death.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to go on
into an afterlife, which

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:10%
so many near-death
experiencers I've heard

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:10%
from call it their real home.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the most significant
lines of evidence

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I have that near-death
experiences prove

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
the existence of an afterlife
is the out-of-body observations

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that near-death
experiencers make.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Nearly half of people who
have a near-death experience

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:90%
will have an out-of-body state.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll call it an OBE.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
During that time, their
consciousness rises up.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And usually from an
area above their body,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
they can observe
both their own body--

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
often frantic resuscitation
efforts and other earthly

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:90%
ongoing events going on--

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
again, at a time that they're
often clinically dead.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Part of my study was to look
at 617 near-death experiences.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
We found 287 of those
near-death experiences involved

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
observations of earthly
everyday events at this time

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
when they were
unconscious or dead.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And to my considerable
surprise, we

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.118 align:middle line:84%
found that an unbelievable 97.6%
of the time, every observation

00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that they were making,
everything that they

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
shared in our survey in their
narrative form was realistic.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there was nothing

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
that seemed unrealistic
about their observations

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
of earthly events to either
the near-death experiencer

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
or to myself personally
looking over their narrative.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.928 align:middle line:84%
The number of people
that described

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
a near-death experience
while they're

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
undergoing general anesthetic.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:84%
To understand how
amazing that is,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
understand that when you
have a cardiac arrest,

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:84%
you have no potential for
a conscious experience.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, when you're
under general anesthesia,

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
you're under a blanket
of complete sleep.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You have no potential to
have any kind of memory,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
any kind of conscious
awareness, because

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:90%
of the general anesthesia.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But put the two
together, if you will,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
there's doubly no reason
for you to have any memory

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:90%
or any conscious experience.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that is when these
near-death experiencers

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
describe their experience.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
We know that's true
because they typically

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
describe in the
out-of-body state

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:84%
during their
near-death experience,

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
with their consciousness
above the body,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
they see-- and some have
described dramatically--

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
their electro cardiogram,
a measure of heart

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:90%
electrical activity, flatlining.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And there is the immediate
frantic resuscitation efforts

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that they watch from their
ringside seat above their body.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then as time
goes on, they go on

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and have a typical
near-death experience.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But in our study, we found
23 near-death experiencers

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
that had their experiences
while under general anesthesia.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I compared 33 elements of the
near-death experience to other

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:90%
NDEs--

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that being experiences
not associated

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:90%
with general anesthesia.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusion, the take
home lesson from my study

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
was the two groups of
near-death experiences

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:90%
are essentially identical.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely amazing.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences
happen, and they

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
are typical near-death
experiences,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
even if they occur under
general anesthesia.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
To me personally,
I am astounded when

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I encounter near-death
experiences that

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
occur in the blind that
involve vision, but especially

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiencers
in those born blind.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed at length
a near-death experiencer

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:90%
who was born blind.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Never had any visual perception
during her entire life.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when she had a car
accident at the age of 22,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden she had
vision and described

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
in great detail what her body
looked like in the emergency

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
room table below, went on to
describe a typically highly

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:90%
visual experience.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's absolutely
no medical explanation

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:90%
for this possible.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
In my research, I
found that a fully 96%

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of the time,
near-death experiencers

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
described meeting
familiar beings that they

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
knew from their earthly life,
that these beings were deceased

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.483 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
near-death experience.

00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:10%
And actually what's
interesting is

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:10%
the number of
near-death experiences

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:10%
where they encountered
somebody who seemed familiar,

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't know who it was.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And only when the
near-death experiencer

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
looked at old family
portraits, all of a sudden,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
they would go, a-ha,
that's the individual

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:90%
from my near-death experience.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Say a great grandfather, a
great-great grandmother, people

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that they never even
met in their life.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet there, by studying
old family portraits

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
later on after their experience,
suddenly connect the dots

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and realize dramatically that
that was who they encountered.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We found in our study of
near-death experiences

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
not only from just
around the world,

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
but even in very
different cultures,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
in non-Western cultures,
the core element

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experience seems
to be basically the same.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences
are far more similar

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:90%
than they are dissimilar.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to think whether
you're an Arab in Saudi Arabia

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
or a Hindu in India or a
Christian in the United

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:84%
States, the core NDE
experiments, what happens when

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
you nearly die, that elements
of the near-death experience

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:90%
all seem to be the same.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
This puts me out, if you
will, a little bit on a limb.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Here I am as a
physician who's actually

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
studied near-death experiences
and making an amazing claim

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence is so
strong that, certainly to me,

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
it proves the existence
of an afterlife.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.850 align:middle line:10%
For thousands of years, the
great religions have said,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:10%
take on faith that we
have life after death.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:10%
Take on faith that there's more
than just what you see and live

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:10%
in our earthly existence,
that you are more,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:10%
that you are a
magnificent being that

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:10%
lives on and on after you die.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
incredible thing is?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, that message

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.602 align:middle line:84%
of faith in every shred of
research I have is validated.

00:12:52.602 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it seems to
be true that there really

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:90%
is life after death.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If you want to find a
concentration of NDE-ers,

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
you might try going to
one of their conventions.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
This one, the
International Association

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
of Near-Death Studies, is the
largest of the associations.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:10%
They get together every
year for fellowship

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:10%
and lectures, and yes,
to tell their stories.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
If you ever had doubt
that heaven awaits you,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
a day at an IANDS
conference will erase that.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The NDE-ers in the group,
those who have actually

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:84%
died and lived to
tell the tale, are

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:84%
so anxious to tell
their story of death

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and rebirth that they wear
a red dot on their name tags

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:90%
so they can be recognized.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I nabbed the first four red
dots I saw and asked them

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:90%
for interviews.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
What I heard made my jaw drop.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
First up was Martha St.
Claire from Salem, Oregon.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
In 1974, she was water skiing
on the Sacramento River

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
when her arm got
wrapped in the rope.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:84%
She was dragged underwater
and nearly drowned.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I found myself going
through a dark tunnel.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I had
been there before,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and I had the sense
that I was going home.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:10%
There was gorgeous
flowers and colors--

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:10%
and colors that you
don't see on Earth.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like I had my body, but
it wasn't a physical body.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of
like a light body.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really look
at my body, but I

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:90%
sensed it was full of light.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself in
the universe, just stars

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and galaxies, and it
felt completely normal,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:90%
like I was home.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Boom, I was just
back in my body.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
There was, no, please, can I
come-- it wasn't any agreement.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Just boom, I'm back in my body.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't really know what
to do with my experience.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:10%
Back then, this
was a year before

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:10%
any near-death experience
books had come out.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I had heard nothing about it.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I told my
family about it,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
even though they could
see my arm was damaged,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
they were like, that
didn't happen to you.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It frightened them.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.677 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to hear about it.

00:15:13.677 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I really had no one
to talk to about it.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I have a
counseling practice,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and I comfort
people with hospice.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing about
my near-death experience

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is that I've always felt my
whole life much more connected

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:90%
But I'm always tuned in heaven.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm always tuned
into that energy.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I have no fear of
death whatsoever.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait
to go home again.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said that, in My house,
there are many mansions.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.393 align:middle line:84%
If it were not so, I
would have told you so.

00:15:44.393 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So I only tapped into a small
part of a huge universe,

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there's
different places,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.907 align:middle line:84%
and that's why people go
to so many different levels

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So how do you know you
weren't just having

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
this hallucinogenic
high experience?

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
However, in my hippie days,
I've had some drug experiences.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Not extensive, but
enough to know this

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
was nothing like that.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And I've had acid.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Never was crazy about it.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like that.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that compares to
this divine light that we see.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.285 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it
happens to our soul.

00:16:22.285 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:90%
It happens to our soul.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.182 align:middle line:84%
So I feel glad I
can tell you that,

00:16:27.182 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:90%
glad I can share it with you.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's true because
I've had the other experiences,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Then there was Gary Guthrie,
who had a near-death experience

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
in 1982 in South Africa as the
result of a blood infection.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I became very sick,
and I thought, well,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
this is just the
flu or something.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And New Year's Eve came, and
I spent the night partying

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and went to bed about 3:00 AM.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.555 align:middle line:84%
And at 6:00 AM, I woke
up with tremendous--

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
the blood was really
getting to my heart

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
and was going awfully fast.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that moment where
I felt that I was going to die,

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
so I just prepared
myself to die.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
And it was that moment that
I looked out of the window

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the sky opening
and a light coming through.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes later, I
was just in tears,

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and this was not normal for me.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that this
had been something divine.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the light was unlike
any light that you see here.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It was unlike any light I've
ever experienced before.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It was very loving
and very healing,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and it embraced you in
its warmth and its love.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing I had
ever experienced

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:90%
before that or since.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I was 30 at the time.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching school,
teaching overseas.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the Philippines
and living a very Hugh Hefner

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
kind of life.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But the near-death
experience changed all that.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I began to think more deeply
about, well, why am I here,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and what is life all about?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And where do we go
after this life?

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:84%
For about a week after
my near-death experience,

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I had sort of a
vision, as I was going

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
about my daily
activities, of what life

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
could be like in South Africa.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I felt that people did
have a love for each other

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and that they showed
kindness towards each other

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a united
feeling among each other, which

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:90%
on the surface wasn't true.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But I could see it as sort
of what the future is going

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:90%
to be like in South Africa.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The light speaks to
people in different ways.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It's all-intelligent
so it's all-knowing.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So it knows the individual,
and it speaks to the individual

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
according to their individual
needs and their awareness

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:35.575 align:middle line:84%
and their readiness to
accept a higher life.

00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Barbara Bartolomé of
Santa Barbara, California,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
had a near-death experience
as the result of an injection

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of dye during a
pre-surgical myelogram.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:84%
She left her body and saw vivid
details of the panicked events

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:90%
to revive her.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The last thing I saw before
I passed out was him checking

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to where his finger was on
the button and then realizing,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I've got my
finger on the wrong button

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and I've lowered her head.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And this look came across his
face, and then I passed out.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And the minute
that I passed out,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:10%
it literally was
shutting my eyes

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:10%
in my body that was
there on the X-ray table

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:10%
and then opening them and
being a different perspective

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:10%
up on the ceiling.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The thought that
ran through my head

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
was, wow, if they're all
so upset and I'm up here

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and my body is down
there, then I've died.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I saw them bring
in an oxygen cart,

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and they put the
oxygen mask on my face.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I saw who did that and
everything that was going on.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:10%
I saw them bring
in a heart monitor,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't know what it was.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And as I was looking down and
watching all this happening

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:10%
and talking to God, who I
sensed was right there with me,

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to see what that box
was that they had brought in.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually was able to
go from the ceiling over right

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
in front of--

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
my viewpoint changed to where I
was right in front of the box,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching the
line going across the box.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was just making this
monotone beeping sound,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and it was just going, beep.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.500 align:middle line:84%
At about four minutes
into that, they

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
decided that somehow
they couldn't

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
get the defib unit
in there in time,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and they had a conversation.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation
was, why don't you

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:90%
try hitting her chest?

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And everybody kind
of separated away

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:90%
from the front of the table.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.178 align:middle line:84%
And he arced his
arm over his head,

00:21:34.178 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and it came down and pounded
on the center of my chest.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So I watched that from above.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And the second time
he did that and arced

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:84%
his arm over his head, then my
vision just shot from up above.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:10%
And when I blinked
open my eyes, I

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:10%
had the oxygen mask on my
face and I was looking up

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:10%
into everybody's faces.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.595 align:middle line:10%
I had this euphorial
feeling, this absolute thrill

00:21:56.595 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:10%
to be back in my
body and feeling

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.917 align:middle line:10%
so grateful that I was back,
and I wanted to express that.

00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:10%
So the minute they took
the oxygen mask off,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:10%
I said, oh my god, that was
an incredible experience.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:10%
I was up on the ceiling.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:10%
I watched you all, and
I could see everything

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:10%
that was going on and hear you.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:90%
She put the oxygen mask on me.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.975 align:middle line:84%
He wheeled in that
heart monitor.

00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:10%
And I started
pointing out people

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:10%
and what they had
done while I was dead.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:10%
And you guys were talking,
and you said this to him,

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.020 align:middle line:10%
and he said that to you.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:84%
The orthopedic surgeon
stayed and comforted me,

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and I told them
what had happened.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:10%
So everybody listened.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.858 align:middle line:10%
But then as I was wheeled up
to my room and after I was

00:22:40.858 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:10%
stabilized-- and this was
the night before the surgery,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:10%
they did the surgery
the next day--

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:10%
no one-- no one would talk to
me about it because they knew

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:10%
that they had made an error and
what happened caused me to die,

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and they were
afraid of a lawsuit.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't talk about
it for about 10 years.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.230 align:middle line:10%
But finally, a
friend of mine was

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:10%
having someone near to her die.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:10%
And so it bubbled
up out of me, and I

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:10%
realized it was my
reality all these years.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:10%
And I knew the story, but I
needed to talk to other people

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.420 align:middle line:10%
to kind of help them
because it totally

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:10%
eliminated my fear of death.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't really want to
be hurt before I die.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able
to have it be easy.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:10%
But the actual experience
takes away all fear

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:10%
that you have of passing over.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there's
Jenny Sommers,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
a graphic artist with
IBM in Tucson, Arizona.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
As a young woman, Jenny
went to summer camp

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:90%
with a number of her friends.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
To play a joke on
the camp counselors,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Jenny ran into a building
that was under construction

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and fell 15 feet down a hole
designed for a staircase.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
It took rescuers almost an hour
to reach her comatose body.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
By the time they did,
she was in the midst

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:90%
of a deep near-death experience.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And evidently, I guess I had
died because they were talking

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:90%
as if I couldn't hear them.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And I started to float
up out of my body,

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and I was encased in this love.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It was just wonderful.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, does everyone
get to experience this?

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just marvelous.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And the answer was, yes.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And I said, even Hitler?

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:90%
And, yes.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:10%
And I knew it had to be
true because that love is

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.595 align:middle line:10%
so inclusive and so beyond
anything in this world.

00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:33.200 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I know, I'm
in front of three moving

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:90%
kind of blobby shapes.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is my
great grandma Julia,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.613 align:middle line:84%
and she's telling me
I need to go back.

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
you have to go back.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, I'm
not going to go back.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So next thing I
know, I'm with Jesus.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of feel like I'm
in the principal's office,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.988 align:middle line:84%
and he's now telling
me, you don't

00:24:52.988 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
have to go back if
you don't want to.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, finally somebody
is listening to me.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I took back some
of my future events

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that my family was
going to go through.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when I wake up from
the coma, I see my mom.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I say, mom, mom, you're
going to die in two years.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing I was in a
coma, not knowing they

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:84%
said I had a 50-50
chance of survival now.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.642 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know the hell
that she had been through.

00:25:21.642 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, she told me
that every time I

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
would wake up from recovery
and tell the story again,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:90%
I was forgetting more and more.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So now we're out of the
hospital, we're back home.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And she has a Raymond
Moody book in her hand,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and she said, tell me again
about me dying in two years.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.717 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:25:40.717 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And I could see she was serious.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait, why are
you asking me that?

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you told
me that in the hospital

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.063 align:middle line:90%
I was going to die in two years.

00:25:48.063 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, I didn't.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe
she was telling me.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
She closed the
Raymond Moody book.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
She said she never wanted
to talk about it again.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Go fast forward two
years later, my mom dies.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
She's in a car wreck
with my sister.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
My sister was the driver,
but they got hit head-on.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And Teresa survives,
but my mom doesn't.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It's about reconnecting
to who we really are.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal mind
that we reconnect to.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like here we're
unplugged from our source,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and we try to take
our plug and plug it

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.017 align:middle line:90%
into each other and things.

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
This person is going
to make me happy.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
This car is going
to make me happy.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And we keep trying to draw
our energy from people,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:90%
things, this dimension.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And every time we take
that plug and we connect it

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
back to our source,
then we become full

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:90%
and then we become connected.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And so now I realize I don't
need these outside things,

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
but I can be that light in
memory, that energy that

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
reminds people to not
plug into each other

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.382 align:middle line:90%
but to plug into God.

00:26:56.382 --> 00:27:01.706 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.706 --> 00:27:04.126 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:04.126 --> 00:27:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Before leaving California, I
wanted to see my friend Leslie

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Gant, one of the hosts from
the MSN program "Live Earth."

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Leslie was hit by a
car in Washington DC

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and nearly killed,
an event that she

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.520 align:middle line:84%
reflected on when
we got together

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:90%
near her home in Santa Monica.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> A few years ago, I
was in Washington DC,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was riding
my bicycle home.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And a van hit me, and I flew
18 feet and shattered my jaw.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:90%
My cheekbone was broken.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had on my helmet, so thank
goodness I'm alive for that.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But if I didn't have on my
helmet, I would not be here.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've thought
a lot afterward,

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, where
would I have gone?

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And do other people
think about that?

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Do other people
consider what happens

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:90%
after this life is over?

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Does the man on the street
think about the afterlife?

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:84%
We decided to find out by
visiting Santa Monica's Third

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Street Promenade
to ask people we

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.557 align:middle line:90%
met what happens when we die.

00:28:18.557 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What are your perspectives
on life after death?

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, there's a great
life after death.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.993 align:middle line:84%
You're just here for
a while, and it's

00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
better life after death.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Better land above.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you had any
experiences with that?

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I did.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I had
a near-death experience.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.513 align:middle line:84%
I had my tonsils
being taken out.

00:28:34.513 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember it was a
light tunnel, and the tunnel,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.097 align:middle line:90%
it takes you right up there.

00:28:38.097 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And all the way in, it's
just this beautiful land

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and everything's pretty,
and it was just perfect.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden,
it just came back.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have any
specific thoughts about it,

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
but I think that it has to be
something because everything

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:90%
here, it can't just be as it is.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
It has to have something more.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I fully believe that there
is something after we die,

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
but it's up to us if
we want to cross over.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, I think nothing happens.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
the cycle of life.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.040 align:middle line:90%
When people die, it's over with.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there is
any mystical ascension

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.818 align:middle line:90%
or anything of that sort.

00:29:15.818 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I won't be
seeing him in heaven.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm going.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's what
I think happens.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You do go to heaven or hell,
just depending on, I guess,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:90%
what you did through life.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I subscribe to
the Christian point of view.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think about
the finality of it,

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and I think about that I
don't want to think about it.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
when people die,

00:29:41.415 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:84%
it's just like
candle is blowed out.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:84%
People die as people die, and
the spirit cannot exist without

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:90%
a body.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:90%
That's my thought.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.262 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess either you
go to heaven or hell.

00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
What you do here
on Earth is what's

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to
you after you die.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're good,
you go to heaven.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
If you're bad, you
go to hell, I guess.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.255 align:middle line:90%
I know for a fact, yes.

00:30:02.255 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Me personally,
my grandmother,

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
she said she had died
when she had my father.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:10%
So she told me about the tunnel,
but I didn't believe her.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:90%
And then I almost died.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I almost drowned when I
was like seven years old.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So I saw the tunnel,
but I woke up.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Swear to God.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So you just saw the tunnel?

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:90%
And I just never made it.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Just woke up.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Did your life flash
before your eyes?

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:90%
But I was small.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I was seven years old.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you were seven.

00:30:29.297 --> 00:30:30.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Seven years old.

00:30:30.352 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's just
this endless thing,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.280 align:middle line:10%
just like here and right now,
like here in this interview,

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:10%
and different stages.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.878 align:middle line:10%
And it's like the play
is always different.

00:30:38.878 --> 00:30:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It's always a different script.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:90%
It's always a different movie.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.008 align:middle line:10%
But it's the same soul
always going through.

00:30:45.008 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I believe.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.494 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:51.954 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:51.954 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I arrived at Dr. Raymond
Moody's house in Deep South

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Alabama.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.653 align:middle line:90%
Raymond, how's it going?

00:31:10.653 --> 00:31:11.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Paul.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:13.371 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you, man.

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, man.

00:31:14.277 --> 00:31:15.173 align:middle line:90%
>> How you been?

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:15.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:31:15.536 --> 00:31:17.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to talk to you
about the afterlife.

00:31:17.369 --> 00:31:18.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's my
favorite subject.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's do it.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go talk about it.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In the early '70s, Dr. Moody,
then a philosophy professor

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
trained at the
University of Virginia,

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
began to explore the stories
of people who had almost died

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and crossed the line
into a heavenly realm.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
These stories have been told
throughout human history,

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:84%
but Dr. Moody was the first
to dissect them and discover

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:90%
their similarities.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
He called them
near-death experiences.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
When he wrote about these
in a book "Life After Life,"

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the field of near-death
studies began.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I have written four
books with Raymond.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I even helped him move into
his home here in rural Alabama.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So I felt very comfortable
interviewing him

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:90%
in his living room.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But even as well
as I know Raymond,

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised by
some of his answers.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.490 align:middle line:84%
You've had your own
near-death experience.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And based on those
two things, the fact

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that you've heard
all these stories

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and you have your own story
to tell, what do you think

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:90%
happens when we die?

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think happens
when we die is that we enter

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
into another state of
existence or another state

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that is so
extraordinarily different from

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
the spatial and temporal frame
of reality in which we exist

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world that the
language we have is not yet

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:84%
adequate to describe this
other state of existence

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When we leave our mortal
body, how do we leave it?

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.420 align:middle line:90%
What do we look like?

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> People say that in the
realm of existence they enter

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
into upon the point of death
that there is no such thing

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:84%
as physicality as we
experience in this realm.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they
have a physical body.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
It's rather that they have
some other sort of vehicle,

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.950 align:middle line:84%
which they find it very
difficult to describe,

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
but that it does have a form,
that it carries a personality,

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
but that it's just entirely
impossible to describe it

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in terms of or analogously to
the kind of body that we have.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it characterized as
a spiritual body, for example.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a term that I hear
from a lot of people.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So when they come
back, they're changed.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:90%
They're transformed.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of
transformations we see with

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:84%
people who come back from
near-death experiences.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The most prominent
one is that whatever

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:84%
they had been chasing
before, whether knowledge

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:84%
or fame or power or money or
any of these other things,

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that when they
come back, they say

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:84%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're alive

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:17.790 align:middle line:90%
is to learn how to love.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> How has this knowledge
affected your life?

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
>> The most powerful one to
me has been that it really has

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
convinced me of the
importance of love,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.219 align:middle line:84%
and I try in every day
to be loving to people.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I genuinely do try in my
day-to-day interactions

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
with people, that I try to keep
in mind that I will be seeing

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:84%
this again and that I will
be seeing this event not

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
from the way I'm seeing
it now through these eyes,

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
but that I will be
seeing this event

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes of the people
with whom I've interacted.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think the world
would change if you were able

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to prove that there
was an afterlife?

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people get to thinking
about this, and they think, oh,

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
if that were the case, then
we'd all love each other.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
nirvana, and there wouldn't

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:90%
be any problems in the world.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it
would bring people

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to a state of complete love and
make everybody saints and so

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I honestly don't accept that.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
But there is one thing
that I am absolutely

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:32.950 align:middle line:84%
sure that a rational proof
of life after death would do,

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and that would be that
it would fundamentally

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:40.440 align:middle line:84%
alter the structure
of the human mind.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.380 align:middle line:84%
If we could have a rational
proof of life after death,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.570 align:middle line:84%
then human beings
would never again

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:84%
be the same because the entire
structure of our cognitive mind

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:90%
would be expanded.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
What I can honestly tell you
from the bottom of my heart

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is that I accept
that there is a God

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and I have a
relationship with God

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and I talk with
Him all the time.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
What I honestly don't know yet
from the rational point of view

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:84%
is whether life after death
is in His plan or not.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it may well be, if you
think about it, that God

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
has something in
mind for us that

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:84%
is even more
remarkable than what we

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:90%
might call a life after death.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.920 align:middle line:90%
In other words, I love God.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I have a trusting
relationship with God.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.065 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't told me anything
yet about an afterlife.

00:36:34.065 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
have to wait and see.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The next day,
I went back to Dr.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Moody's to talk to him about
his next field of study--

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:90%
shared death experiences.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
He feels this subject may
provide the best answer yet

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to the question, what
happens when we die?

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Simply stated, shared
death experiences

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:84%
take place when
bystanders at the deathbed

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:84%
have the same experience
as the person who is dying.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they say that
they went up a tunnel

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:84%
or had a life review
with the dying person.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the implication of
this, if you think about it,

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.590 align:middle line:84%
is that this really does
throw a monkey wrench

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional way of
debating about near-death

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.030 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
physiologists tell

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
us, who say that these
experiences are hallucinatory,

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:34.100 align:middle line:84%
is that as the person is
dying, the oxygen supply

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:90%
to their brain is lowered.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And hence, they have these
hallucinatory effects.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But if that's true, why
would the bystanders

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.660 align:middle line:84%
have the same kind
of experience?

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, why would they?

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very
difficult to explain.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that once these
findings come out and are

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.330 align:middle line:84%
thoroughly understood
by the public,

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be into
an entirely new dimension

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
of discussing
near-death experiences

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.280 align:middle line:84%
because that old
stand-by, that, oh,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:84%
this is just hallucinations
caused by brain damage, that's

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:84%
out the window with these
empathic death experiences.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Now if you don't
mind me saying this,

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:84%
you and your family had a shared
death experience at the bedside

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:90%
of your mother.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I did indeed.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, when my
mother was dying,

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I and my sisters
and one of my brother in-laws

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:84%
were there, and all had
astonishing experiences

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:90%
at the moment my mother died.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's one of the
most exciting fields to study.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes, Paul.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The study of
afterlife studies,

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one
of the most exciting--

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul, this is the new
frontier of knowledge.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Because now we have
not only this awareness

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that these near-death
experiences are not

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.850 align:middle line:84%
confined to the people who
almost die, but kind of leak

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:84%
out by whatever unknown means
to the people standing around.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very paradoxical
and astonishing thing

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:90%
to wonder what is going on here.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> "Men love to wonder,"
said Ralph Waldo Emerson,

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:84%
"and that is the
seed of science."

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I am reminded of
that quote whenever

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I am with Raymond Moody.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
For half of his
life and counting,

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.280 align:middle line:84%
the good doctor has pursued
the big question of religion,

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.220 align:middle line:90%
science, and philosophy--

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.070 align:middle line:90%
what happens when we die?

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are people out
there, millions of them,

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.040 align:middle line:84%
of all races, creeds,
colors, and religion

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
who don't need a
scientific answer.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:90%
They know from experience.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:57.398 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.398 --> 00:39:59.858 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:59.858 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:90%


00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to the
Pacific Northwest

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.500 align:middle line:90%
to visit Galen Dean Loven.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.650 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 11, Galen
took it upon himself

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to prove to a neighbor that
gasoline burns on water.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:84%
He filled a 5-gallon gas can
from the family farm's gas tank

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and went down to a nearby
creek to make his point.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I was standing on these
two logs pouring the gasoline

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
upstream, so the gasoline
is flowing underneath me.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And I look over, and
there is my friend

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:41.050 align:middle line:84%
approaching the creek
with a lit match.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And the look on his face was--

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I would say horror.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:84%
He was doing something he
didn't really mean to do,

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:90%
but could not do.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In a hot second, Galen
was covered by gasoline

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:90%
and engulfed in flames.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.130 align:middle line:84%
The pain was so intense that
young Galen could feel nothing.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:84%
He collapsed into
the water, where

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
his voyage to the
other side began.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> My next awareness is I'm
horizontal with my hands

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:90%
by my side in a funnel.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It was not really a tunnel,
but it was a funnel.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And the inclination of the
sides was not that great,

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:90%
but it was obvious.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was horizontal dead
center, and I was moving along.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was aware of my body.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:90%
My whole body was there.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I could look and see,
and it was physical, OK?

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It was very physical.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And inside the cone was--

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a vacuum,
but it wasn't anything

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
in particular other
than something.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I knew outside of this funnel
there was more substance.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.545 align:middle line:84%
It felt more solid on the
outside of the funnel.

00:41:49.545 --> 00:41:51.465 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving along a bit
and then look ahead,

00:41:51.465 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and I see this
little tiny pinpoint

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:90%
of light, a little white light.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, my
speed really picks up.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So I'm accelerating like crazy.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I reach a fast
speed and stay at that speed,

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:84%
but every millisecond, I'm
moving faster and faster

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and faster and faster.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.530 align:middle line:84%
As I'm doing that, the
sides of the funnel

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:11.880 align:middle line:90%
are expanding away from me.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm still dead center.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm still physical.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm still able to look around.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling of excitement,
this feeling of anticipation,

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:84%
this feeling of joy
was just overcoming me.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It was almost bursting out
of my chest, it felt so good.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And just at that point
when I'm almost there--

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this light is big,
the sides of the funnel

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much gone, And
I'm almost in the light--

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.520 align:middle line:84%
wham, I wake up in the
bottom of the stream.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And I am just furious.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
That was my first
instant reaction.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.985 align:middle line:84%
Even before I really was
aware that I had slime

00:42:47.985 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
in my mouth and
everything else was

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I was just pissed
that I was here.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Galen raised out of the water
and began to assess the damage

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:90%
to his burn-ravaged body.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Sheets of skin hung from his
arms, exposing bone and muscle.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
From a vantage point
outside of his body,

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:09.060 align:middle line:84%
he watched as he ran to
the farmhouse to get help.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Rushed to the hospital
in Edmonton, Canada,

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Galen was lucky to find that
two burn surgeons from Houston

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.330 align:middle line:84%
were visiting to give
a seminar on the latest

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:90%
treatment of petroleum burns.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.665 align:middle line:84%
Within minutes,
Galen was in surgery.

00:43:23.665 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I looked like a
toasted marshmallow.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Of any war pictures you've seen,
napalm victims or whatever,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.550 align:middle line:84%
they have no
discernible features,

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.140 align:middle line:84%
they're just a bloated mass,
that's what I looked like.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I had no mouth,
no ears, no eyes.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The IV was hooked
up into my foot

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:84%
because that was
the only place they

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.540 align:middle line:90%
could find any place to put it.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was on a morphine drip
for the next four weeks.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Through months in the
hospital and years of pain

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and surgery, Galen continued
to think about his journey

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:84%
in the tunnel and his near
encounter with the light.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Death revealed its
nature to Galen

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and gave him special knowledge.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that's the first
time I became consciously aware

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.350 align:middle line:84%
that we live beyond
this life, OK?

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely knew that.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So from that point on, death
had nothing, no hold over me

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:90%
I was fearless.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Probably pushed the envelope
more than once, right?

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.135 align:middle line:84%
But I also found out
I became really good

00:44:21.135 --> 00:44:22.715 align:middle line:90%
with people who were dying.

00:44:22.715 --> 00:44:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I could just be around them.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
do anything at all.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:90%
They just felt better.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
isn't that interesting?

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It's probably because I
never really came back.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:90%
My trip was interrupted.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought
up until recently,

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I always had one foot
on the other side,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.820 align:middle line:90%
straddling the fence of life.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
absolutely am certain of

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:84%
is that whatever it is that we
do after this moment of time,

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.600 align:middle line:90%
it is a good thing.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It's peaceful.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:90%
It's joyous.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.130 align:middle line:90%
It's harmonious.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher level
of intellectual being,

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is a connectivity
there to this larger universe

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:90%
than we have here now.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Galen says he isn't waiting
for science to make a decision

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.230 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
He believes in the
afterlife and has

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.760 align:middle line:84%
no fear of dying when
his contract is up.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.116 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.116 --> 00:45:27.220 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:90%


00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:84%
The same is true
of Lupita Kirkland.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 13,
Lupita and her family

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.950 align:middle line:84%
traveled to Acapulco for
her coming out party.

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
When Lupita and her family
checked into the hotel,

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:84%
they were treated to a concert
just below their eighth floor

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.210 align:middle line:90%
balcony.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.640 align:middle line:84%
One of Lupita's sisters
recommended that they

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:90%
run to the lobby and watch.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Lupita did just that.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But unbeknownst to her, someone
had closed the sliding glass

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.410 align:middle line:90%
door going back into the room.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Lupita ran through
the door, which

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.390 align:middle line:84%
shattered into sharp
shards and covered her

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:90%
with a thousand cuts.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw a lot of blood, like
somebody's pouring a full host

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.630 align:middle line:84%
full of blood all
over the place.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And so my dad grabbed me,
and he put me in the bed

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and he wrapped the blouse
to compress on my wound.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And because I have
wounds all over my veins,

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:84%
he asked me just to hold him so
I could cover the wounds here

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.480 align:middle line:90%
in my arms.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I was going to die.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So I told my dad
that I'm going to die

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:48.180 align:middle line:90%
Today.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I saw my body in the distance,
and I was in the room.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had the vision of
my mom getting the doctor,

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and she was
screaming and crying.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And I felt sorry for her.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to console her and
let her know that I was OK.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was afraid
at the first moment

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:84%
when I was detached
from my body,

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:21.280 align:middle line:84%
an overwhelming sense of
peace came all over me.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was OK, that
I was going back home.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to share that
with my parents that I was OK,

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't talk
to them anymore.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I saw my dead body
just laying there.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor came, and
I remember him saying,

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.870 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, she's not
going to make it.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I saw the tunnel.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be
made of dark clouds.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the tunnel,
there was a light.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.850 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that light, I
saw the image of what I believe

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.920 align:middle line:90%
is the Virgin Mary.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was reviewing
my life with her,

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and we spoke about
my mission in life.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we had
spoken about me coming back

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.280 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that my
mission was not complete

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:90%
and that I needed to go back.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So finally, I was
pulled back like, smack,

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.815 align:middle line:90%
with this reaction.

00:48:35.815 --> 00:48:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And I felt how my soul
enter into my body,

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.980 align:middle line:90%
like it was strong.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling how the
doctor was performing the CPR.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
huge pain in my chest,

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and all the pain, the physical
pain, came back to my body

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:90%
after I came back.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to get all
the air I could into my lungs,

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:84%
like I could not have enough
air, and the doctor saying,

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.880 align:middle line:90%
she made it.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.720 align:middle line:90%
She's back.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:90%
She's back.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's start stitching.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The doctor had no anesthesia,
so young Lupita was forced

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to suffer through the painful,
but necessary ordeal of being

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.970 align:middle line:90%
sutured with no painkiller.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> They had to stitch
four layers in my neck,

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.040 align:middle line:90%
and he started with the aorta.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
painful experience,

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:46.800 align:middle line:84%
which I was literally
screaming and thinking--

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:54.690 align:middle line:84%
it was a mix of feelings between
not wanting this pain again,

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:58.410 align:middle line:84%
sad for having to come
back, but at the same time,

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I was mesmerized by
the whole experience.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.380 align:middle line:84%
After I started to talk
about my experience,

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I told my parents that
I knew the doctor met

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.340 align:middle line:90%
my mom by the third floor.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was in shock,
like, who told you this?

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.760 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I saw it.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no,
somebody told you.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.280 align:middle line:90%
No, I saw it.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So they could not believe
what was happening.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I need to go back
and thank him for what he did.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So we went back to
Acapulco a year later.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We went to the address, and
particularly in that address,

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:90%
there was no house.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
like an empty lot.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And there were houses around,
so we started to look around

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.260 align:middle line:84%
for him and ask for his
name, Jesús or Jesus.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I never found him.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> How has this affected your
life in the intervening years?

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't come back the same.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.090 align:middle line:90%
I was a different person.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:15.630 align:middle line:90%
I was more spiritual.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And also, I became a more
compassionate person,

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:28.870 align:middle line:84%
concerned for others, and
feeling a sense of love.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:30.730 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to die.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.340 align:middle line:90%
This is just a transition.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see and
you're going to meet home,

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be fine.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Take all the love that you
have gotten here in this world

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and just remember
those beautiful moments

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and take them with you
and share them with God.

00:51:53.230 --> 00:52:02.176 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.176 --> 00:52:04.661 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:04.661 --> 00:52:15.098 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.220 align:middle line:10%
>> New Orleans has been
called many things,

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.450 align:middle line:10%
from an ingrown self-obsessed
little city to a place that can

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:10%
drive a sober-minded
person insane.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The religious and the profane
love this noisy drunken city

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:84%
on the Mississippi because it
confirms their mutual belief

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that the likes of Sodom is
alive and well in the world.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.940 align:middle line:10%
And both camps can definitely
agree that this American city

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.400 align:middle line:10%
made it through a
near-death experience

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.922 align:middle line:10%
at the hands of a
hurricane named Katrina.

00:52:53.922 --> 00:52:56.182 align:middle line:90%

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And it is here in this city
of death and resurrection

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that I brought together our
scholars of the afterlife,

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Moody and Jeffrey
Long, to summarize

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:10.650 align:middle line:84%
their feelings on mankind's
greatest question--

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.230 align:middle line:90%
what happens when we die?

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.655 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:14.655 --> 00:53:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I brought you here
to New Orleans

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
afterlife, namely

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.810 align:middle line:90%
what happens when we die.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:25.180 align:middle line:84%
What does your research
tell us about that?

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, what you
can talk to people

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.590 align:middle line:84%
about who are afraid
of death, what

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you can say to them because
you're both the experts.

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Paul, I can say
positively that I think we do

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:38.480 align:middle line:84%
know a little bit about the
entranceway to the afterlife

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We know that initially
people go through experience

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.480 align:middle line:84%
of seeming to leave their body,
going into a realm of light,

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.240 align:middle line:84%
seeing their relatives
who've passed away,

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.700 align:middle line:84%
reviewing everything
they've ever done.

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And as this extends,
I gather they

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:58.540 align:middle line:84%
are able to continue their
intellectual pursuits.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, that love
seems to be almost

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the foundational organizational
principle in the afterlife,

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that we still maintain
love and that we still

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.080 align:middle line:84%
have our personal identities
to some degree intact.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely fantastic,
the research we're doing.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Certainly in humility,
I would point out

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that what we don't know far
exceeds what we do know.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what I consider to be
so positive about the research

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
is that we're now

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:84%
at least connecting
some of the dots,

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.530 align:middle line:90%
developing some understandings.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of the understandings
that we're coming to

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.020 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely remarkable.

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I think they could literally
change the world in terms

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of their impact on people.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.250 align:middle line:84%
If people could just know what
we know, that we don't really

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.680 align:middle line:84%
die, that there is an
afterlife, it's for all of us,

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.520 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderful, and that we
don't have to fear death.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.083 align:middle line:84%
>> You guys have taken
the research so far.

00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm curious
to know what you can

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:54.880 align:middle line:90%
say to people who fear death.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We have every right to say
to people that you don't need

00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:59.680 align:middle line:90%
to fear death.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.380 align:middle line:84%
This gives a great
basis from which

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to work with patients
on their fears of death

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because this is
solid information now

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:09.940 align:middle line:90%
that does convey hope.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And that people who have lost
a loved one to death, which

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
is the worst pain
that life can bring,

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.850 align:middle line:84%
can be comforted now by
the fact, as I regard it,

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that there is a world
beyond in which we

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:30.460 align:middle line:84%
can be reunited and continuing
our relationship with our loved

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.260 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.730 align:middle line:10%
>> And, Paul, I think in the
books that we've all written

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.700 align:middle line:10%
together, what I think is most
important is that this is not

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.760 align:middle line:10%
wishful thinking.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.460 align:middle line:90%
This is not speculation.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.850 align:middle line:84%
This is solid evidence based
on solid principles, research

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:44.600 align:middle line:90%
with scientific basis.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's with that underpinning,
with that knowledge that we've

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.060 align:middle line:84%
gained through our
research over the years

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that we can have that
confidence in saying,

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.000 align:middle line:90%
yes, there is an afterlife.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And there it is.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:56:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the void we all fear
at death isn't a void at all,

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:03.340 align:middle line:84%
but instead a gateway
to an afterlife.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps our death is,
as Dr. Moody said,

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.070 align:middle line:84%
an experience of
love and learning

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:14.050 align:middle line:84%
so unique that we can't perceive
it without the help of God.

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps at death, our
life has just begun.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.350 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
happens when we die?

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think when we die that
we go on to another lifetime.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
whatever happens in

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that lifetime absolutely
has to do with karma

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.320 align:middle line:90%
from your previous life.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you give
in your life today,

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to
wind up with whatever

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:52.160 align:middle line:84%
you gave in the previous
life in the next life.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I think when you die,
your soul just basically goes

00:56:54.855 --> 00:56:55.655 align:middle line:90%
to heaven or hell.

00:56:55.655 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on how you
live your life that determines

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.960 align:middle line:90%
basically where you go.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, mine
will go to heaven.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
happens when you die?

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I don't think anything
happens after you die.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You just die?

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You just die.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Soul goes nowhere?

00:57:15.308 --> 00:57:16.108 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:57:16.108 --> 00:57:17.024 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:57:17.024 --> 00:57:19.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
happens when you die?

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Heaven or hell, but
I'm going to heaven.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.420 align:middle line:84%
One day, I'm going to get on
track where my beliefs actually

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.960 align:middle line:90%
line up to what I'm doing.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:90%
But that's just my beliefs.

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:30.672 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
happens when you die?

00:57:30.672 --> 00:57:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Your body goes to the ground,
your soul goes to heaven.

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.146 align:middle line:90%
That's your other life.

00:57:35.146 --> 00:57:37.500 align:middle line:84%
It's called the land
of milk of honey.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Jesus promised,
whosoever believe

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in me shall set at my
right side of my Father.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.180 align:middle line:90%
That's in the Bible.

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I think when you
die, you're happy.

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.430 align:middle line:90%
